This article is motivated by the problem of optimization under uncertainty for complex multidisciplinary systems, but it is also applicable to other single-disciplinary uncertain optimizations. Existing uncertain multidisciplinary design optimization (UMDO) methods usually require complex multidisciplinary decoupling and uncertainty propagation analysis, which limits the application of complex system optimization methods. This article suggests a new method that uses the conditional value at risk (CVaR) analysis to quantify uncertain parameters and uses a collaboration model to decouple multidisciplinary systems. This method provides an effective new scheme for the optimization of complex systems under uncertainties. In this article, we describe mathematically the expression and approximation methods of CVaR analysis. We then show how to effectively decouple multidisciplinary systems through a collaboration model. Finally, a framework for UMDO is constructed. By applying this method to three examples, the results suggest that this method is feasible and effective. In future research, the problem of complex system optimization under mixed uncertainties of parameters and models will be investigated.
