/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the use of artificial intelligence methods to improve the efficiency and quality of the automation engineering software development process. Our goal is to develop and integrate intelligent assistants in existing automation engineering development tools to minimally disrupt existing workflows. Practitioners should be able to adapt our framework to other tools and data. Our contributions address important practical problems: 1) we address the lack of realistic data sets in automation engineering with two publicly available data sources; 2) we make the reference implementation of our algorithms publicly available on GitHub for other practitioners to have a starting point for future research; and 3) we demonstrate the integration of our framework as an add-on to an existing automation engineering toolchain.
