This study focuses on the robotic cell scheduling problem with batch-processing machines (RCSP-BMs) and discusses the influence of the buffer sizes and different batching methods on scheduling. In this study;  we propose a green scheduling algorithm and a multiobjective differential evolution algorithm to optimize the makespan and the energy consumption of the batch-processing machines simultaneously. In future research;  we will address more complicated situations;  such as many-objective optimization and many-robot scheduling.
