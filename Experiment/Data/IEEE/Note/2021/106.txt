Effective and intelligent decisions about production planning could have a significant influence on the performance of the manufacturer. This article is motivated by a tactical production planning problem that we encounter in a factory producing discrete equipment. A production plan needs to be made with the consideration of various realistic characteristics in this factory. Without delaying the orders, the objective of the plan is to balance the workload throughout the planning horizon. Currently, the planners make the production plan manually based on their experience in Microsoft Excel. Due to the complexity of this problem and the increasing number of orders, it is difficult and burdensome for planners to make a high-quality production plan manually. In this article, a mathematical model is proposed to formulate this problem, and some theoretical properties are derived to help solve this problem. An enhanced variable neighborhood search-based algorithm is proposed to solve large-scale problems, which could provide a more detailed plan than the current plan. This study could ease the planner from burdensome planning work, improve the quality of the production plan significantly, and be adapted to solve planning problems with similar production characteristics and objectives. In the future, more production characteristics will be considered to meet the diversified demands of production planning.
