/i>\nâ€”For autonomous mobile-robotics-based applications where a robot equipped with a tool or sensor is required to survey an area for inspection;  monitoring;  cleaning;  and so on;  effectively covering the area is desirable. However;  for energy-constrained systems such as aerial vehicles with limited flight time;  complete coverage is not possible. Presented here is a new Voronoi-based path generation algorithm that takes energy constraints into account to generate waypoints for the robot to follow in a near-optimal configuration while maintaining path-length constraints. The approach is applied in simulation and experiments for an application in environmental monitoring using unmanned aerial vehicles.
