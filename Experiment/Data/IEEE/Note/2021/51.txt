/i>\n—Recently;  the rapid development of mobile devices and mobile communication leads to the prosperity of mobile service computing. Services running on mobile devices within a limited range are allowed to be composed to coordinate through wireless communication technologies and perform complex tasks and business processes. Despite its great potential;  mobile service compositions remains a challenge since the mobility of users and devices imposes high unpredictability on the execution of tasks. A careful investigation into existing methods has found their various limitations;  e.g.;  assuming time-invariant availability of mobile services. This article presents a novel reliability-aware and deadline-constrained service composition method for mobile opportunistic networks. Instead of assuming time-invariant availability of mobile nodes;  the proposed method is capable of estimating service availability at run-time and leveraging a Krill–Herd-based algorithm to yield the deadline-constrained;  reliability-aware;  and well-executable service composition schedules. Case studies based on well-known service composition templates and real-world data sets suggest that it outperforms traditional ones in terms of success and completion time of composed services. It can thus aid the design and optimization of composite services as well as their smooth execution in a mobile environment. It can help practitioners better manage the reliability and performance of real-world applications built upon mobile services.
