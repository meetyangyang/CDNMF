/i>\n—This article is motivated by the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) collision avoidance problem in practical missions;  such as farming and emergency response. In recent years;  various trajectory planning and tracking algorithms have been widely developed. However;  the environmental complexity and the intruders’ unexpected movement pose difficulties in trajectory planning;  especially in ensuring the computation time under the allowable threshold. Moreover;  the UGV practical trajectory tracking is a challenging task which demands a desired response within various physical constraints. In this article;  a two-stage conflict resolution system is proposed. First;  a trial-based forward search (TFS) is used to generate a new trajectory deviating the UGV from the initially generated trajectory by the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA);  aiming to avoid the unforeseen intruders (unknown in prior) in real-time. Using these two trajectory planning algorithms alternatively;  both global trajectory optimality in a cluttered environment and appropriate maneuvers with respect to unexpected intruders can be achieved. Subsequently;  the UGV is modeled according to its kinematic characteristics;  and thus a multiconstrained model predictive controller (MMPC) is designed to follow the reference trajectory. The physical constraints are respected by integrating them into the controller. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can guide and control a UGV from the start to the destination safely and smoothly;  even in the case of multiple obstacles with constant or varying velocities. Furthermore;  the proposed collision avoidance strategy can be extended to other unmanned systems;  including unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vehicles.
