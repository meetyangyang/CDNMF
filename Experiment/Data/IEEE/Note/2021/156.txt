/i>\nâ€”Real-time software is particularly difficult to design since;  in addition to ever more complex functional constraints;  it has to satisfy a set of stringent nonfunctional requirements;  such as deadlines. In fact;  the violation of deadlines can lead to breakdowns;  data loss;  and so on;  which can be catastrophic for critical applications. This article presents the DEAD-CALC project for computing efficiently the deadlines of reconfigurable real-time devices to run possibly under energy and resource sharing constraints in all the system implementations. A device;  in the software level;  is a superset of implementations;  each of which (i.e.;  a set of periodic software tasks) is activated and executed at a particular time according to user requirements. DEAD-CALC reduces the development time by computing the deadlines to be certainly respected without any additional feasibility analysis of the device. The calculation can only consider the real-time aspects;  or both the harvesting energy and resource sharing constraints;  giving the user the ability to configure the system under different conditions. DEAD-CALC is a visual environment that can be simply used by designers to compute and display these deadlines;  with a few clicks;  in arranged tables;  and in a short time. This project can be a future reference for industrial partners who will be focusing on various real-time applications design;  such as the intelligent manufacturing industry;  intelligent transportation systems;  embedded systems;  wireless sensor networks;  smart grids;  medical control devices;  and military platforms.
