/i>\nâ€”Wafer quality control has become an essential fab operational problem in semiconductor manufacturing industry. In cluster tools;  which are dominantly being used for diverse wafer fabrication stages;  it has been proven that the wafer delays within process chambers have a crucial impact on the wafer quality. Accordingly;  modern fabs have introduced stringent quality control to regulate wafer delays in cluster tools. In this research;  we propose a scheduling strategy to minimize the wafer delays when a cluster tool concurrently processes multiple wafer types. We first show that the release sequence of different wafer types significantly impacts the wafer delays under concurrent processing;  and we then propose how these wafer delays can be minimized by finding the optimal wafer release sequence.
