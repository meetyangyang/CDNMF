Robot grasping of objects lags far behind human experiences and poses a significant challenge in the robotics area. To solve it;  we present new multilevel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process red green blue-depth (RGB-D) images and realize optimal grasping detection of unknown objects. Moreover;  we provide details of the network structure;  network training;  and network testing. The testing results obtained from the open grasping data set show that the multilevel CNNs can significantly increase the accuracy of the grasping rectangle compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments were implemented on different robotic platforms;  including a five-degrees-of-freedom Youbot arm with a parallel gripper and a UR5 robot arm with a Shadow multifingered dexterous hand. The results validate that the multilevel CNNs offer excellent generalization and robustness for handling different sizes and shapes of unknown objects;  as well as background disturbances;  which are key problems in robotic manipulation..
