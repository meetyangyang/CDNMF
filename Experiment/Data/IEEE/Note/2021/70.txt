/i>\n—This article was motivated by developing an effective solution for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to execute road-network persistent surveillance tasks under outdoor circumstances. To the best of our knowledge;  there is no other consideration dealing with this problem. To capture spatiotemporal random events;  we proposed a new approach that enables UGV to persistently monitor an area with road-network performing in the weighted mode. Distinguished from the traditional path planning methods in the literature;  the proposed approach considered the detection ability of the UGV. Consequently;  the so-called “area-to-area” planning approach does not require traversing all the viewpoints. The approach can be used in road-network with any topology. Moreover;  the difficulty in modeling road-network from the actual environment is degraded;  and compared with the existing patrolling methods;  the monitoring efficiency of the proposed approach is improved obviously.
