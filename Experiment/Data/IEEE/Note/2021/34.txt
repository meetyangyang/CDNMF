Motor imagery-based brain–computerinterfaces (MI-BCIs) are widely used to allow a user to controla device using only his or her neural activity. This articleproposed a new framework to classify two-class MI tasks basedon electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this framework,a new sparse spectrotemporal decomposition method is used toextract time–frequency features from EEG signals. A convolutional neural network with squeeze-and-excitation blocks is thenconstructed to classify the MI tasks. We show the superiority ofour method on two datasets and prove its feasibility for long-termMI-BCI applications.
