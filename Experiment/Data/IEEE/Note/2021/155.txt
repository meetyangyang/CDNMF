/i>\nâ€”In many process industries;  there exist black-box operation optimization problems and large-scale nonlinear optimization problems with variable coupling. For these problems;  it is difficult to establish mechanism models between input and output. However;  real-time data can be measured from the system through sensors. We can utilize this process information to optimize the system so as to attain the desired objective. In this article;  we propose a novel estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) which applies a filtering scheme to revise the modeling data and a learning strategy to improve sampling;  which can solve the problems with the characteristics of nonlinearity;  variable coupling;  and large scale. Computational experiments show that the EDA is effective. In the future;  the proposed algorithm can be applied to some practical optimization problems such as operation optimization in blast furnace;  which is considered as a continuous production process with variable coupling. The algorithm has the potential to help optimizing the process control parameters.
