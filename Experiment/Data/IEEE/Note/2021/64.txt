/i>\nâ€”Software execution data record rich information on the runtime behavior of software systems. Discovering an overall behavioral model for the whole software system typically results in an extremely complicated model that hinders further comprehension and usage. With the observation that a software system is composed of a set of interacting components;  this article considers the problem of discovering a behavioral model per component. The proposed techniques are implemented in the open-source process mining tool ProM;  and experimental evaluations using both synthetic and real-life software systems have indicated their applicability. The proposed approaches are readily applicable to industrial-size software behavior comprehension.
