This work is motivated by the long calibration time problem in using an steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) because most state-of-the-art frequency recognition methods consider merely the situation that the calibration data and the test data are from the same subject and the same visual stimulus. This article assumes that the model parameters share the stimulus-nonspecific knowledge in a limited stimulus frequency range;  and thus;  the subject's old calibration data can be reused to learn new model parameters for new visual stimuli. First;  the model parameters can be decomposed into the stimulus-nonspecific knowledge (or subject-specific knowledge) and stimulus-specific knowledge. Second;  the new model parameters can be generated via transferring the knowledge across stimulus frequencies. Then;  a new recognition algorithm is developed using the transferred model parameters. Experiment results validate the assumptions;  and moreover;  the proposed scheme could be extended to other scenarios;  such as when facing new subjects;  or adopting new signal acquisition equipment;  which would be helpful to the future development of zero-calibration SSVEP-based BCIs for real-life healthcare applications.
