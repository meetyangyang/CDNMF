Energy efficiency models deliver many advantages;  ranging from energy-aware machine design to process optimization. Although a large amount of works in the past focused on physics-based and experimental modeling for specific machining configurations;  it can be more effective to improve the applicability of the modeling methods by involving the configuration variables into the models. Due to the uncertainties in both the machine and the operation environment;  machine learning is adopted to fit the high-dimensional and high-nonlinear energy system. To the best of our knowledge;  this is the first article that provides a comprehensive survey on ML-based modeling in terms of data sizes;  temporal granularities;  feature selection;  and algorithm performance. Such a survey helps engineers quickly justify the appropriate ML methods to meet the actual requirements.
