/i>\nâ€”The motivation of this article is to present a time-varying formation tracking strategy with predefined performance for a class of uncertain nonaffine nonlinear MASs within a directed topology. To simplify the process of solving the formation tracking problem;  the presented strategy incorporates ADRC with the backstepping technique. Employing ADRC;  our strategy approximates the uncertainties of the MAS followers via ESOs. The uncertainties are then compensated through real-time estimations of extended states. Moreover;  with ADRC;  TDs are used to estimate the derivatives of complex nonlinear functions;  eliminating the requirement of the operations of higher order derivatives of virtual control variables. It provides a feasible strategy for industrial applications.
