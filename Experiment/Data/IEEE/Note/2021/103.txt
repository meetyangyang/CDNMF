The backward sequence, which is widely used for scheduling single-armed cluster tools, is analyzed with processing time variations in processing modules (PMs). The backward sequence is proven to be optimal in many cases with deterministic processing times. However, in reality, the wafer processing time in a PM is not deterministic and varies within a given time range. With regard to this issue, we analyze the performance of the backward sequence with processing time variations. This study can be very helpful for not only tool engineers but also for researchers who are interested in scheduling automated manufacturing systems.
