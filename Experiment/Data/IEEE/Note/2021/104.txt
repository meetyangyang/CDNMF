The focus of this article is to develop a GDISSIM monitoring strategy to detect faults for non-Gaussian industrial processes. The GDISSIM strategy separates Gaussian information and non-Gaussian information. The non-Gaussian distribution is further evaluated by multiple Gaussian clusters with their posterior probabilities. In this way, the monitoring of twofold information can be effectively integrated to provide more fine-grained and practical monitoring performance.
