Collaborative target tracking is a typical problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where the sensors need to be scheduled to address the constraints of the limited network resources;  such as sensor energy usually supplied by the battery. In the recent years;  energy harvesting device has been developed and applied to WSNs to overcome the energy restriction. As the energy harvesting capabilities of the sensors are limited;  sensor scheduling remains as a challenging problem and is studied in this article. A novel multistep prediction-based adaptive dynamic programming (MSPADP) approach is proposed for collaborative target tracking;  by scheduling sensors for the current time step based on the predictions of the subsequent steps over an infinite horizon. It runs iteratively in two modules: obtaining the previous optimal multistep sensor scheduling and updating the remaining infinite-step performance. Simulation results show its superior tracking performance compared with single-step prediction-based ADP (SSPADP);  multistep prediction-based dynamic programming (MSPDP);  and multistep prediction-based pruning (MSPP) approaches;  and lay a good foundation for the practical applications.
