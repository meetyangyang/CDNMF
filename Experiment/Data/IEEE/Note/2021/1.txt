Here, we consider a real-world application problem of energy-aware machining parameter optimizationencountered in flexible turning operations, namely, design of aparametric optimization method that can be generalized to various machining tasks where multiple objectives and constraintsvarying with the machining configurations. This paper presentsa novel meta-reinforcement learning (MRL)-based optimizationmethod to improve the generalization by training optimizer withmultiple machining tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this isthe first MRL-based method of adaptive parameter decision forenergy-efficient flexible machining. It should be highly emphasized that technologists benefit from the reduced decision-makingtime and the improved energy saving opportunity.
