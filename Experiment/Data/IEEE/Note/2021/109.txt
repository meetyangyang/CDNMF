Automated processes could help increase malaria vaccine production to a global scale. Currently;  production requires technicians to manually dissect mosquitoes;  a process that is slow and tedious and requires a lengthy training regimen. This article presents an improved manual fixture and procedure that reduces technician training time. Furthermore;  an approach to automate this dissection process is proposed and the critical step of robotic manipulation of the mosquito with the aid of computer vision is demonstrated. Our approach may serve as a useful example of system design and integration for practitioners that seek to perform new and challenging pick-and-place tasks with small;  nonuniform;  and highly deformable objects.
