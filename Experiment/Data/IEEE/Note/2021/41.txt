/i>\n—As robotic systems approach the micrometer scale;  designing them to be fully autonomous will rely less on onboard computation and more on component selection and design. In this article;  we are motivated by synthetic cells—microscopic devices with limited actuation;  sensing;  and memory components. We apply tools from optimal control;  graph theory;  and information theory to develop a methodology for designing the electronic circuitry that relates actuation to sensing using memory and physically realizable transformations (e.g.;  simple logical operators). Results indicate that encoding task information in the physical body of a robot via a simple control policy leads to successful task performance. In future work;  we plan to apply these methods to different robotic systems and to experimentally employ these designs on actual synthetic cells.
