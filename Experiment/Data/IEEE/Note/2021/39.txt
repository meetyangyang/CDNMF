This article is motivated by the emerging need for intelligent demand-side management (DSM) approaches in smart microgrids in the presence of both power generation and demand uncertainties. The proposed robust energy scheduling strategy allows the decision maker (i.e.;  the energy manager of the microgrid) to make a satisfactory tradeoff between the users' payment and constraints' violation rate considering the energy cost saving;  the system technical limitations and the users' comfort by adjusting the values of the budget of uncertainty. The proposed framework is generic and flexible as it can be applied to different structures of microgrids considering various types of uncertainties in energy generation or demand.
