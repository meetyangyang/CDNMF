/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the intermittent fault prognosis problem of discrete components (e.g.;  relays and hydraulic valves) in hybrid systems. Existing fault prognosis researches do not consider discrete component which is an important part of hybrid systems. For the intermittent fault prognosis of discrete component;  the observation window (OW) concept and coordinate reconstruction (CR) method are proposed to establish the degradation model;  and the ratio of fault duration to OW is used to define the failure threshold of discrete component. To show the effectiveness of the proposed methods;  an application on a hybrid circuit system is considered. It is noted that the degradation pattern (e.g.;  increase of frequency or duration of intermittent fault) of discrete components may vary in different systems;  while the degradation process can be quantified by the OW and CR methods developed in this article;  which enables the prognosis of intermittent fault in discrete component for various hybrid industrial systems. The proposed approach can be applied to industrial hybrid systems if the following conditions are satisfied: 1) the hybrid bond graph model of the monitored system can be established;  based on which the fault detection and isolation can be implemented and 2) the monitored system contains multiple discrete components suffering from intermittent faults whose appearing and disappearing instants can be identified by certain method.
