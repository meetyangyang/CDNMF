/i>\nâ€”UHF radio frequency identification (RFID) has been widely applied as an asset management ID sensor in many fields. RFID-based mobile robot navigation technology can further increase its application value as a location sensor. This article proposes a standalone RFID-based mobile robot navigation method;  in which the reference tag and the external sensors other than RFID are both not required. In the proposed method;  only a single passive tag is attached to the static target object. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can enable navigation task with good performance in situations in which the absolute navigation goal position is not known in advance.
