A novel registration approach is presented for image-guided liver surgery (LGLS). Compared with existing nonrigid registration methods;  two significant changes (or improvements) exist in the proposed registration framework: 1) the normal vectors are extracted and utilized in the rigid registration step and 2) the anisotropic positional uncertainties are considered. In both steps;  the registration problems are formulated as a maximum likelihood (ML) problems and dealt with the expectation-maximization (EM) technique. In both steps;  the matrix form of the updated positional covariance is provided and can speed up the computational process. The readers are reminded that with extra information and a more general positional error assumption;  our approach demonstrates improved performances in the case of partial-to-full alignment.
