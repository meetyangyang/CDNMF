This article analyzes the control problem of switching off/on a machine tool for energy saving during machine idle periods. A control policy based on time information is investigated when the machine requires a startup time to resume the service after being switched off. The proposed policy works online while acquiring information from the real system. An algorithm is described for identifying and applying the optimal control parameters. The results of this research will be useful for a practical implementation of a switching policy for energy saving. This implementation requires the estimation of the power adsorbed by the machine in four different states and;  therefore;  it reduces the implementation effort for practitioners.
