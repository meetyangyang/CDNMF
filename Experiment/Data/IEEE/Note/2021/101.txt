The problem of hand-eye calibration for the da Vinci robotic surgical system and kinematically similar systems is addressed in this article. Existing approaches have insufficient accuracy to automate low-level surgical subtasks and often require external patterns or subjective human intervention, none of which are applicable to practical robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) scenarios. This article breaks down the calibration procedure into systematic steps to reduce error accumulation. Most of the time-consuming steps are performed offline, allowing them to be retained between movements. Each time the passive joints of the manipulator or the endoscope move, all that needs to be done is to refresh the transformation between the fixed markers. This key idea enables intraoperative updates of the hand-eye calibration to be performed online without sacrificing precision. The calibration method presented here demonstrates that the achieved accuracy is sufficient for automating basic surgical manipulation tasks, such as grasping a suturing needle. The hand-eye calibration will be incorporated into a visually guided manipulation framework to perform high-precision autonomous surgical tasks.
