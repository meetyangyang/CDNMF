Automatic vision-based defect detection on the solar cell is difficult due to inhomogeneous texture and low contrast between defects and background in the surface. In order to solve these problems;  by combining the proximity and continuity of Gestalt principles;  this article proposed a new iterative tensor voting algorithm which can refine the curvilinear structures with iterations. Experiments have shown that the proposed method can detect crack under the interference of inhomogeneous texture and complex background.
