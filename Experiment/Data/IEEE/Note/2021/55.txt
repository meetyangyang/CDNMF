/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the problem of data gaps in magnetic flux leakage (MFL) data in actual pipeline safety transmission measurements;  which seriously affects defect inversion and assessment. In this article;  in terms of the intrinsic characteristics for MFL data;  we propose a new and effective approach by extracting the multifeature of defects and using conditional risk to recovery data gaps. Our method takes advantage of the no-missing part of MFL data and prior samples;  which are obtained from practical measurements. The experiment results show that our proposed method is more advantageous than the comparison methods;  and therefore;  our proposed method has strong practical value. Our future work will aim at improving the versatility of the proposed method.
