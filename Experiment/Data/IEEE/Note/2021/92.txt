This article is motivated to develop a micrograsping system which enables dexterous rotating manipulation of microparts. The core of the proposed system is the utility of two fistulous tampered borosilicate 3.3 glass probes, which show high compliance in the microdomain. The manifested compliance enables the stably grasping of spherical objects during dexterous rotating manipulation and the vision-based contact force evaluation and regulation. The proposed system can rotate objects about two independent axes so that the orientation of a micropart can be adjusted to the desired one. This is critically important for many practical applications, such as the assembly of microballon and microneedle and the beamed cell penetration.
