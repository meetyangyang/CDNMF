/i>\nâ€”Although some in-line monitoring approaches have been proposed for specific conditions;  little research has been done to develop a prealarm method; in particular;  this study proposes predictive monitoring by using data from multiple sensors (or status variable identifications;  SVIDs) to predict one sensor in one process step of semiconductor manufacturer. The prealarm benefits the early troubleshooting and equipment capacity. This study also applies concept drift and equipment parameter monitoring (EPM) to identify the prediction model misalignment or equipment misalignment. In practice;  root cause identification of the prediction error is critical and benefits the model retraining and equipment maintenance.
