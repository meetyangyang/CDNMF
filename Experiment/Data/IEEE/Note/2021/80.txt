/i>\n—The multilayer overlay error of the photolithography process is one of the remarkable and challenging issues in wafer fabrication. In a multilevel manufacturing process;  errors occur at each level;  which would be accumulated in the upstream operations. The optimization objective will be even more critical in a high-mixed fabrication process. In this study;  the learning-based control system emerged with the state-space model compensates the multilayer overlay error. The Gibbs sampling as a Bayesian approach as a core structure of optimization algorithm is utilized;  which can be updated with information from engineering’s domain knowledge or estimated information about previous runs. The robustness of the proposed optimization algorithm is shown by comparing the distribution of overlay error with conventional methods and with a fast convergence rate of the learning algorithm.
