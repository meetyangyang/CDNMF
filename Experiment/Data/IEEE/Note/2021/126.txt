There is often more than one treatment option for EOL products or components;  including reuse;  remanufacturing;  and recycling. However;  the decision on which EOL option to select is not considered in most of the DP studies by assuming an EOL option given for each component. Hence;  the disassembly plan with the EOL decision is focused in this article. As energy sustainability gains an increasing attention;  it is essential to assess the profitability and energy conservation simultaneously for EOL products. Since there could be a tradeoff between recovered profit and conserved energy;  a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is developed for generating Pareto solutions which help decision-makers to find good solutions for both evaluation indicators.
