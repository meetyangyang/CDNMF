/i>\nâ€”This research represents a new orientation for guiding efficiently the model checking of reconfigurable discrete-event systems. A classification of properties described in computation tree logic (CTL);  according to their dominance and equivalence relations;  allows one to conduct an efficient verification by avoiding inefficient calculation due to redundant properties. In this case;  giving a verification order for these properties allows one to shorten their verification time. An extension named reconfigurable CTL describes the new syntax of the proposed classification. This approach can be applied in modeling and verification of advanced reconfigurable systems arising from smart grids;  adaptive sensor networks;  intelligent transportation;  reconfigurable manufacturing;  and embedded systems.
