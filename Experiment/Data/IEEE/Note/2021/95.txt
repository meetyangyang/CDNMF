This article is motivated by the problem of the automatic recognition of activities that are daily performed by elderly or disabled people in a smart dwelling. The set of activities to be recognized is defined by a medical staff (e.g.;  to prepare meal;  to do housework;  to take leisure;  etc.) and correspond to pathologies that have to be monitored by doctors (e.g.;  loss of memory;  loss of mobility;  etc.). The proposed method is based on a systematic procedure of offline construction of a model for each activity to be monitored (the activity discovering step). The online recognition of activities actually performed (the activity recognition step) is afterward based on these models of activities. Since the human behavior is nondeterministic;  and may even be irrational;  probabilistic activity models are built from a learning database. In the same way;  probabilistic indicators are used for determining online the most probable activities actually performed. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study performed in a smart living lab.
