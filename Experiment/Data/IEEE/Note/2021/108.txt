This article provides a decision support tool to HC managers;  which appropriately assigns caregivers to clients and makes routing decisions over a long horizon. Chargeable overtimes and preference matching enclosed in this tool are rarely considered in the literature;  despite matching is relevant in HC caregiver-to-client assignments and chargeable overtime has potential in tailoring the service level based on the specific client. We formulate the scheduling problem as a mathematical model. Then;  we propose a matheuristic algorithm to efficiently solve the problem in real-size instances. The results show the applicability and efficiency of our method. Thus;  HC managers can exploit it to efficiently make assignment and routing decisions and to analyze the impact on other operating costs when adjusting any of them.
