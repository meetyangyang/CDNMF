This article presents a portable device that provides tactile recognition assistance for visually impaired people. Such a technology can be extensively used in tactile mouse and white cane. The developed technology can be extensively used for various industrial applications;  such as surrounding monitoring and manipulation. The proposed work demonstrates the promising ability of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications. The generated tactile signals are expected to be used in many human-centered systems;  and we believe that our contribution is an important step toward the development of a more comprehensive assisting technology for visually impaired people.
