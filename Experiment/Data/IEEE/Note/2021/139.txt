/i>\n—Cooperative unmanned systems have drawn significant interests in military and civilian applications. During missions’ execution;  it is of great importance for cooperative unmanned systems to have fault-tolerance capabilities for achieving the desired mission when faults occur in one or more team members. A challenging problem is how to detect and isolate the fault and how to mitigate the fault effects on the whole mission. This article presents a fault-tolerant formation control strategy in the case of severe actuator fault occurrence in a team of wheeled mobile robots.
