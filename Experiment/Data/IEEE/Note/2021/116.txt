For effective concrete placement, the tip of the concrete pump needs to move linearly in the task space. Tool-center-point (TCP) control allows the operator to directly specify the tip velocity in the task space instead of separately controlling the axes of the manipulator. In this article, the control task is posed as an inverse kinematic problem, which is solved by quadratic optimization (cQP). The framework of cQP enables the direct inclusion of system constraints while being computational efficient for online implementation on the electronic control unit of the truck. The approach addresses concrete pump specific problems and requirements of the tool center point movement and actuator constraints. Restrictions in the task space are not treated.
