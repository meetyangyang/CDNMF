This article considers the tradeoff between profit maximization and energy cost minimization for the green cloud data center (GCDC) providers while meeting the delay constraints of all tasks. Current task-scheduling methods fail to take the advantage of spatial variations in many factors;  e.g.;  prices of electricity and availability of renewable power generation at geographically distributed GCDC locations. As a result;  they fail to execute all tasks of heterogeneous applications within their delay bounds in a high-revenue and low-energy-cost manner. In this article;  a multiobjective optimization method that addresses the disadvantages of the existing methods is proposed. It is realized by a proposed intelligent optimization algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that in comparison with the two state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms;  the proposed one increases the profit and reduces the convergence time. It can be readily implemented and integrated into actual industrial GCDCs.
