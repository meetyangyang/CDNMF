This article was motivated by theproblem of facilitating the interaction of human operators withhuman–machine interfaces (HMIs) of complex industrial systems.Standard industrial HMIs are static and do not consider theuser’s characteristics. As a consequence, least-skilled operatorsare prevented from their use and/or have poor performance.In this article, we suggest a novel methodology to the design ofadaptive industrial HMIs that adapt to the skills and capabilitiesof operators and compensate their limitations (e.g., due to ageor inexperience). In particular, we propose a methodologicalframework that consists of general rules to accommodate theuser’s characteristics. Adaptation is achieved at three different levels: perception (i.e., how information is presented), cognition(i.e., what information is presented), and interaction (i.e., howinteraction is enabled). The presented rules are independent ofthe target application. Nevertheless, we establish a relationshipbetween such design rules and user’s impairments and capabilities and kind of working tasks. Hence, designers of HMIs arecalled to instantiate them considering the specific requirementsand characteristics of the users and the working tasks of theapplication at hand.
