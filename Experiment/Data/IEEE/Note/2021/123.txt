Energy saving together with productivity improvement in the manufacturing system becomes the focus of both academia and industry over the years due to the increasing deterioration of the environment and the advancement of commercialization. In order to maintain better social welfare, the government usually makes time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing policies to rebalance energy demand. For each manufacturing company, a tradeoff analysis should be performed to adapt to the TOU electricity price, so as to achieve the most desirable outcome. During the decision-making process, the practitioners should assign weights to the productivity and the energy cost to match their anticipation. For a typical manufacturing setting where all the machines are unrelated parallel, the proposed approximate algorithm, also known as the F-SOC algorithm, could be employed to obtain a near-optimal schedule within a short period of time. The proposed approximate algorithm could also work well in situations where the TOU electricity pricing policies are switching, and the preferences for productivity versus energy cost are swaying. A near-optimal schedule could always be guaranteed within a 4% gap from the optimal solution for most cases.
