The objective of this article is to address the significant effects of inaccuracies in the measurements for fault location determination in transmission lines in power systems. These inaccuracies increase the cost and duration of the search process for the actual fault location, and they, thus, also enlarge the outage duration and reduce the power system reliability. This article aims to analyze and reduce the influence of the uncertainties in the measurements in order to obtain a much more accurate fault location estimate when a fault has occurred along the transmission line. One of the key contributions of this article is the development of a model for the uncertainties in the measurements based on a confidence level and deviation bounds; this model can then be used if the information on the distributions of the uncertainties in the measurements is not available. Another key contribution is a maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate line parameters more accurately and consequently to reduce the influence of the uncertainties in the measurements on the fault location estimate.
