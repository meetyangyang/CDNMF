/i>\n—Uncertain object manipulation tasks pose significant challenges to a robotic gripper while grasping and capping unknown objects without damaging them. The existing rigid grippers have experienced flexible manipulation through multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs) by complex mechanical structures;  and the soft gripper can realize stiffness-compliant manipulation differently. The proposed novel robotic in-hand manipulation can execute grasping and cap manipulation by a single flexible shaft to simultaneously achieve bending and rotational movements. The relationship between stretching force and finger’s curvature can enable a custom design for user-specific applications.
