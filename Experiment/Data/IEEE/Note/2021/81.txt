Problems of industrial interest have a tendency of being repetitive in nature. For this reason;  domain experts are always in high demand;  as they are able to harness their experience of similar problems to come up with fast solutions in difficult situations. However;  domain experts are not easy to find. Given this fact;  the present paper puts forth a method for automating the process of knowledge extraction (through experiential learning) and transfer across problems in the domain of computationally expensive black-box optimization. The key novelty and motivation of this work lies in enabling the adaptive transfer of knowledge even when the number of features changes across the source and target problems. Our proposed approach is verified experimentally on a range of benchmarks as well as real-world problems of a computationally expensive nature;  highlighting the utility of an optimization engine that is able to learn from experience without the need for constant human intervention.
