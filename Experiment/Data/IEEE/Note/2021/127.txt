This article establishes a novel dual-objective optimization model for product disassembly subject to multiresource constraints. In an actual disassembly process;  a decision-maker may want to minimize energy consumption and maximize disassembly profit. This article considers both objectives and proposes a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on an external archive to solve optimal disassembly problems. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can solve them effectively. The obtained solutions give decision-makers multiple choices to select the right disassembly process when an actual product is disassembled.
