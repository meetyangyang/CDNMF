This article was motivated by a needto make more accurate predictions with multiple sensors. Traditional data-level and feature-level fusion methods integrateraw sensor data from individual sensors and statistical featuresextracted from individual sensors, respectively. This article suggests a novel decision-level fusion approach as opposed to thetraditional data- and feature-level fusion methods. In the firstcase study, temperature and vibration sensor data are integratedto predict the surface roughness of additively manufacturedcomponents. In the second case study, multiple sensor data arefused to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraftengines. To implement the decision-level fusion technique, it iscritical to determine optimal weights by solving the convexoptimization problem. In future research, we will demonstrate theproposed decision-level fusion approach in real-time prognosticsand health-monitoring applications.
