Smart service is an indispensable element of smart manufacturing. It tries to offer customizedsolutions to address each customerâ€™s needs. Thus, customersneed to be well integrated into the whole smart manufacturingcycle, specifically the initial design phase. Product configuratorshave been widely adopted in various industries to elicit customer needs and transform them into tangible product variants.Most existing configurators require customers to possess enoughexpertise to specify the components or attribute alternatives,which satisfy their needs. This poses challenges for customers toconfigure the product and for companies to realize the smart andmass customization strategy. This article proposes a needs-basedconfigurator mechanism that takes customer needs expressedin natural language as input to generate satisfactory productvariants as output. Deep-learning techniques are applied toimplement the configurator. The new configuration mechanism could shield customers from the demanding process of specifyingsuitable attribute choices from a large pool and greatly improvethe user experience.
