/i>\nâ€”The development of video-processing techniques provides a powerful tool to detect human behavior in real time. In crowd events;  the pedestrian movement must be regulated; otherwise;  it is easy to fall into the faster-is-slower effect. It is especially important for evacuation routes with different widths. In this article;  the optimal feedback control is studied to regulate pedestrian flow in heterogeneous corridors. It takes flow densities as state and produces commands that are composed of entrance influx and free-flow velocities. These commands can be executed with the support of speakers;  displays;  or the recently developed interactive robots. To avoid congestion;  discharges of different corridors are balanced;  and the system is optimally stabilized at equilibrium. Based on our work;  engineers are able to design pedestrian flow control and achieve optimal evacuation in arbitrary heterogeneous corridors.
