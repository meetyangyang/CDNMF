/i>\n—This work deals with a multicrane scheduling problem. Aiming to minimize the total traveling distance of all the cranes;  it establishes a mixed-integer programming model with a workload balance constraint on cranes. It presents a branch and price algorithm to solve the problem whose solution complexity grows exponentially with problem size. The integration of crane assignment and scheduling enables the better utilization of cranes and faster service in iron–steel enterprises and;  hence;  improving customer satisfaction. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It can readily be put into use in the steel industry.
