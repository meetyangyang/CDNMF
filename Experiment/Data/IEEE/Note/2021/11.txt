It is well known that potential qualityproblems may occur and production cost may increase if theresidence time of intermediate products is left uncontrolled.The residence time limits become a concern, especially in theautomotive industry, food industry, and semiconductor industry,where intermediate products stay in a stage susceptible to defects.The limits also apply to large scale additive manufacturing ofthermoplastic polymers. The deposition of each layer is subject tolower and upper bounds of surface temperature, which, in practice, are equivalent to minimum required residence time limitand maximum allowable residence time limit, respectively. Withresidence time considered, the size of state space for the overallproduction system model will grow exponentially, as the systemâ€™ssize increases, which brings tremendous challenges to evaluatesuch a system both in the short term and in the long run. In thisarticle, we introduce a novel modeling approach for a multistagegeometric serial production line with residence time limits andpropose a method that drastically reduces the complexity of thesystem. Such a method provides a quantitative tool to effectivelyevaluate the performance of multistage geometric lines withresidence time limits.
