Bottleneck machines refer to themachines whose performance impedes the production systemsin the strongest manner. They have been widely utilized toimprove productivity, energy efficiency, and so on. However,there are few efforts devoted to the impacts of bottlenecks onthe aggregation method. The numerical studies indicate thatthe traditional aggregation method (TAM) has lower estimationaccuracy in production lines with multiple bottlenecks. Therefore,in this article, improved aggregation method (IAM) is establishedto improve the performance of the aggregation method in theproduction lines. The research contributes to the literaturewith a generalized aggregation method that is very effective inproduction lines with and without bottlenecks. It can be utilizedby production managers to evaluate production performance,predict the impacts of system changes, and accelerate controland investment decision-making.
