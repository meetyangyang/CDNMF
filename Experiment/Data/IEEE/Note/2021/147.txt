/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the issue of 3-D autonomous manipulation tasks for magnetically driven helical microswimmers. The formulated path planning is responsible for finding the shortest route in the 3-D confined space. The closed-loop controller is charge of steering the helical microswimmers on a reference path based on an online updating model trained by neural networks. It is demonstrated that the helical microswimmer can find the shortest path and follow it in a 3-D space with submillimeter accuracy.
