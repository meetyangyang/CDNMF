/i>\n—This article was motivated by the problem of primary frequency controls in modernized microgrids (MMGs) using engine generators;  which are still one of the prime sources of regulating frequency in pilot research and development (R&D) microgrid projects. Although MMGs will be integral parts of the smart grid of the future;  their primary controls in the islanded mode are not advanced enough and not considering existing theoretical challenges scientifically. Existing approaches to regulate frequency using industrially accepted methods are highly model-based and not optimal. Besides;  they are not considering the nonminimum phase dynamics. These dynamics are mainly associated with the engine delays—an inherent issue of mechanical parts—for islanded microgrids. This article suggests a new adaptive optimal output-feedback control approach based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to the abovementioned problem under consideration. By using the proposed methodology;  MMGs can deal with the issues mentioned earlier;  which are challenging. The proposed approach is optimally rejecting uncertain disturbances (considering the load uncertainty and operating point variations) and reducing the impacts of nonminimum phase dynamics caused by the engine delay. Based on our currently available hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) device’s capability of modeling power systems’ components in real time;  our HIL-based experiments demonstrate that this approach is feasible.
