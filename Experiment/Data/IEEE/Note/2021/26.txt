Most of the prosthetic tests are based on amputees;  especially hip disarticulation prostheses (HDPs). This work provides a gait simulation and evaluation system based on the quantified evaluation;  which can repeatedly test the prostheses. The testing system improves the efficiency of the development of HDPs and decreases the security of the test with hip amputees. Furthermore;  the system has backward compatibility for other lower limb prostheses (prosthetic knee and ankle).
