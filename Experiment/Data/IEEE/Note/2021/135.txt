/i>\nâ€”Data imbalances are common in fault classification and affect the effectiveness of modeling in industry. As a generative model;  generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide new ideas for small-class data augmentation. However;  the instability of its training process and the randomness of data generation affect the results of data augmentation. In this article;  the GAN generation process is analyzed in detail. The results of the visualization indicate that no data generation was perfect at any one time. Based on the rules of GAN data generation;  we propose a data selection strategy during training. High-quality data are selected for data augmentation through data filtering and data purification. Apart from this;  we combine the training process of GAN and classification model for imbalanced data to reduce modeling time. Through industrial examples;  we have evaluated the effectiveness of this method.
