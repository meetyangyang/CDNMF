This article presents a novel virtual metering algorithm to estimate the heating and cooling energy at the air handling unit (AHU) level. This virtual metering algorithm fills a gap in the literature and provides a tool that will help detect and interpret energy use anomalies;  identify operational inefficiencies;  and guide on-going commissioning of building energy systems. Facility managers;  operators;  and other stakeholders can use the insights gained from virtual metering to improve building operational performance. Future planned research includes developing virtual meters to characterize energy flows at the zone level and visualization methods to make inverse modeling results more accessible to different building stakeholders.
