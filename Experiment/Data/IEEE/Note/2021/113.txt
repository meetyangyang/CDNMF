This article was motivated by the problem of fault detection, diagnostics, and prognostics (FDD&P) of the building systems. We contemplated to develop an advanced technology for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) prognostics, in particular, for central heating and cooling plant (CHCP) health monitoring, aiming to save energy consumption and the operational cost. The developed machine learning-enabled predictive modeling technique, which can help build predictive models from historic operational and maintenance data, can be applied to other application domains such as oil pipeline system monitoring and high-speed train prognostics.
