/i>\n—This article is intended to provide a novel online collision event handling scheme for robots in industrial environments. This scheme is designed to quickly and accurately detect an accidental collision and distinguish it from the intentional human–robot interaction. The method takes the raw signals from external torque sensors and provides a collision diagnosis result with a reliability index. The simple structure makes it easy to be implemented as a regular fault monitoring routine for collaborative robots. Different from the conventional methods;  the proposed collision identification scheme in this article especially focuses on overcoming the following two challenges in practice: first;  to timely and accurately report a collision within its early stage;  and second;  to ensure a high identification accuracy in a complicated environment;  where ubiquitous disturbance and noise are unneglectable. The experimental validation at the end of this article confirms its promising application value in human–robot collaboration.
