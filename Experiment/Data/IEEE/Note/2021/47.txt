/i>\n—This work is motivated by the problem of searching for robot-destroying hazards that are otherwise invisible to the robots. That is;  we can observe whether or not a robot survives a path;  but;  if a robot is destroyed;  then we have no idea where;  along the path;  its destruction has occurred. A mathematically equivalent problem happens in any scenario;  in which an agent is equipped with an event sensor that can only be set/triggered once;  but that requires postprocessing to figure out if the sensor has been triggered or not. For example;  postprocessing is needed if the determination of whether or not a biological specimen was obtained requires a manual laboratory inspection. We also consider an extension of the hazard detection problem;  in which we simultaneously collect information about search-and-rescue victims using a “victim sensor; ” such as a camera. In this problem;  hazards indirectly affect information gathered about victims because new information about victims is lost whenever a robot is destroyed. We provide algorithms to solve these types of problems. The algorithms work even in cases with noise such that false positives and false negatives are possible. This work is useful in any application where observations take the form of a cumulative “yes” or “no” along a path.
