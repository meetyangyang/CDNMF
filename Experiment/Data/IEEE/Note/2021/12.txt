Manufacturing systems become moreand more flexible, where multiple types of products are made onthe same production lines. Although significant efforts have beendevoted to studying flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs), mostof the research contribute to the steady-state analysis. However,the transient performance is of critical importance for control andimprovement of flexible systems, particularly, when the systemâ€™ssetup times cannot be ignored. Therefore, in this article, an analytical method using approximation and aggregation proceduresis introduced to evaluate the performance of flexible serial lineswith Bernoulli machines and setups. Applying such a method,a long serial line is first decomposed into overlapped two-machinelines and then an iteration procedure is used backward andforward to estimate the line performance. Moreover, even intwo-machine lines, the part sequence is approximated by thedistribution of part types to reduce computation intensity. Usingsuch a method, the system performance of long multiproduct Bernoulli lines with setups can be evaluated efficiently with anacceptable accuracy, which provides production engineers andmanagers an effective tool to study the transient performance ofFMSs, and design real-time production control and improvementstrategies.
