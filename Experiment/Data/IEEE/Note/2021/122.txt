This work aims to maximize the profit and minimize the task loss for DGDCs powered by renewable energy and smart grid by jointly determining the split of tasks among multiple ISPs. Existing task scheduling algorithms fail to jointly consider and optimize the profit of DGDC providers and QoS of tasks. Therefore;  they fail to intelligently schedule tasks of heterogeneous applications and allocate infrastructure resources within their response time bounds. In this work;  a new method that tackles drawbacks of existing algorithms is proposed. It is achieved by adopting the proposed SBDE algorithm that solves a multiobjective optimization problem. Simulation experiments demonstrate that compared with three typical task scheduling approaches;  it increases profit and decreases task loss. It can be readily and easily integrated and implemented in real-life industrial DGDCs. The future work needs to investigate the real-time green energy prediction with historical data and further combine prediction and task scheduling together to achieve greener and even net-zero-energy data centers.
