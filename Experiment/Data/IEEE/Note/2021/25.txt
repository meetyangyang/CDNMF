This article proposes an on-board adaptive algorithm to detect the maximum dorsiflexion (MDF) timing based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) and ankle angle sensor for robotic transtibial prosthesis users in each gait cycle. IMU and angle sensor are integrated in the prosthesis;  and the adaptive algorithm is embedded in the control circuit of prosthesis. The adaptive algorithm can realize the model updating continuously for real-time MDF timing detection with collected and labeled training data. The proposed adaptive algorithm shows satisfactory adaptation for MDF timing detection in different walking speed and ramp conditions. In addition;  the adaptive algorithm also shows some generalizations for prosthesis users;  which are useful to improve prosthesis control.
