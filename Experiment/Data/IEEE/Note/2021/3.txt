This article was motivated by automaticshape control of composite fuselage. The main objective is torealize active learning for predictive analytics, which meansmaximizing information acquisition with limited experimentalsamples. This kind of need for active learning is very commonin the industrial systems where it is expensive, time-consuming,or difficult to obtain experimental data. Existing approaches,from either a machine learning perspective or a statistics perspective, mainly focus on active learning for classification orregression models without incorporating impacts from intrinsicinput uncertainties. However, intrinsic uncertainties widely existin industrial systems. This article develops two active learningalgorithms for the Gaussian process with uncertainties. Thealgorithms take variance-based information measure and Fisher information measure into consideration. The proposed algorithmscan also be applied in other active learning scenarios, specificallyfor predictive models with multiple uncertainties.
