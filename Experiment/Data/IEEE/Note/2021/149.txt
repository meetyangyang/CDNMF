/i>\nâ€”Mobile robot localization is a key technology for its location-based services. Considering that radio frequency identification (RFID) is entirely unaffected by light interference and has a globally unique ID;  RFID has been regarded as a localization sensor with broad application prospects. This article proposes an RFID-based mobile robot global localization method combining phase difference and readability;  by which the mobile robot can be accurately localized in an environment with a relatively sparse reference tag distribution and without the need for offline phase drift calibration. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can localize the mobile robot with good performance;  including centimeter-level position accuracy and satisfactory attitude angle accuracy. The proposed method can effectively contribute to many practical applications;  such as the path tracking of a mobile robot.
