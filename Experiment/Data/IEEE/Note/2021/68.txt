/i>\nâ€”Practical production scheduling problems in iron & steel industry generally need to optimize conflicting objectives simultaneously;  which is very hard for practitioners to make appropriate decisions with manual experience. The decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) can help practitioners of color-coating scheduling to achieve a set of Pareto optimal decisions with good distribution and tradeoff among three objectives. Since the scheduling of the other production lines shares many similarities with our problem;  the proposed model and algorithm can also be applicable to these problems.
