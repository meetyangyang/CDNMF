In the worm biology community, there are thousands of research laboratories worldwide that routinely cope with worm microinjection experiments. This article aims to present the functionality and performance of our automated robotic system for high-speed worm injection. Using the robotic system, a large number of C. elegans can be loaded into the microfluidic device for continuous worm immobilization and injection. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to allow an operator to monitor the injection process on a computer screen, select the injection location inside the worm body (through computer mouse clicking), and direct the system (through keyboard input) for downstream sorting of the successfully injected worms for further culture. Given its unique features, such as high injection speed, high level of automation, and high success/survival rates, this system holds great potential to liberate worm researchers from the tedious manual injection process and provide unparalleled injection throughput and consistency.
