/i>\nâ€”The demand for high-speed atomic force microscope (AFM) increases rapidly. However;  the commonly used raster trajectory limits the achievable scan speed of the AFM. An effective way to improve the scanning and imaging speed of the AFM is the application of the sequential nonraster scanning methods. The trajectories of sequential nonraster scanning patterns mainly composed of few sinusoid signals with different frequencies. Therefore;  the resonant controller (RC) is introduced in this article as it is capable to track the sinusoidal reference with zero steady-state error. Several RCs are selected first based on the spectrum analysis of the reference and the consideration of the harmonics caused by the system nonlinearities;  and then;  they are connected in parallel to form the controller for precise tracking of the reference. In order to realize the digital implementation of the designed controller;  a modified Tustin discretization method is proposed;  which ensures the accurate resonant pole placement of the RC and thus maintains the tracking performance of the RC. In addition;  the fractional-order (FO) calculus is introduced to speed up the convergence of the designed controller while preserving the tracking accuracy;  and this parallel-structure FO RC (PSFORC) design can be implemented to other systems that require high-speed and high-accuracy tracking of the periodic signals.
