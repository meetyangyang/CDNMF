The motivation of this work stems from the need to achieve real-time optimal motion planning for the mobile robot in the humanâ€“robot coexisting environment. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in this area due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the generated trajectory is usually far from optimal. To obtain an optimized trajectory for the mobile robot in the dynamic environment with moving pedestrians, we propose the EB-RRT algorithm on the basis of the time-based RRT tree and the EB method. Depending on the time-based RRT tree, we quickly get a heuristic trajectory and guarantee the probabilistic completeness of our algorithm. Then, we optimize the heuristic trajectory similar to the EB method, which achieves the homotopy optimality of the final trajectory. We also take into account the nonholonomic constraints, and our proposed algorithm can be applied to most mobile robots to further improve their motion planning ability and the trajectory quality.
