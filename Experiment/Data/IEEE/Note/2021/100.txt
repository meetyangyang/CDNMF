Air-handling systems within HVAC condition the air to satisfy human thermal comfort and air quality requirements. The fault prognosis of these systems is critical, since it allows system operators to know the remaining useful life (RUL), thus preventing unexpected breakdowns and reducing the operational and maintenance costs. In this article, a new hidden semi-Markov model-based method is developed to estimate the RUL of an air-handling system and its components. Experimental results show that our method can predict the RUL of the components and systems with high accuracy.
