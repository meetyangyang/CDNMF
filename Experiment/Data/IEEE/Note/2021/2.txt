This article is motivated by two challenges that are frequently occurred in advanced manufacturing.First, many traditional quality evaluation methods are destructiveand operated offline. The destructive and offline propertiesbring in many drawbacks that increase the manufacturing costand reduce the competitiveness of products. Second, when thedata-driven approach is proposed for in situ quality evaluation,the existing supervised feature extraction algorithms for multiprofile process signals usually require many training samples.However, it is expensive to obtain a large number of training samples for many advanced manufacturing processes, which iscalled the small sample size (SSS) problem. This SSS problemleads to matrix singularity and parameters nonidentifiability,and ultimately inconsistent feature extraction results furtherjeopardize the performance of quality evaluation. To addressthese two challenges, we developed a novel method by theoptimal integration of the regularized supervised tensor decomposition and ensemble learning algorithm. The proposed methodis expected to enable an efficient data-driven nondestructiveevaluation for product quality, facilitate early detection of defects,reduce the efforts in manual inspection, and support sustainableadvanced manufacturing. The proposed method is illustrated bythe friction stir blind riveting process, while it can be extendableto other advanced manufacturing processes with online sensingcapabilities.
