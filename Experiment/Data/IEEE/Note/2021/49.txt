/i>\nâ€”As the concept of manufacturing intelligence being proposed and promoted;  system flexibility appears frequently in production in recent years. A flexible production refers to the implementation of small batch-based production with multitype of products on the same production line;  by quick setup or machine adjustments. The steady-state analysis method that is traditionally used might be not applicable in this case since most of the production process is in transient state. An approximation-based analytical method;  for real-time performance evaluation of assembly systems with small batch-based production tasks and with machines having the geometric reliability model;  is proposed. The algorithm developed in this article can be utilized by production managers and engineers;  with which the real-time performance of the systems can be predicted with high accuracy. It can also provide assistance for decision-making on activities of production control.
