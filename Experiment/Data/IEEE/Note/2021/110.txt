An e-consult is a type of consultative service offered on a digital platform where primary care physicians (PCPs) can seek advice from specialists about patient referral recommendations. We aim to investigate the impact of e-consult service design on patient diversion, congestion, and social welfare. Our work exerts an exploratory effort to estimate the value of e-consults by providing a game-theoretic framework that measures the value added by information exchange in the context of a congested flexible service system. Our model sheds light on the value of e-consults in navigating a heterogeneous patient population to the best mode of treatment.
