Many VSAs have been developed to realize theoretically both high bandwidth and good safety due to completely decoupling stiffness and load. However;  there exists some redundancy range that is rarely used in physical interaction with the environment. To avoid this redundancy;  a novel load-dependent nonlinear stiffness actuator (LDNSA) was proposed in our previous work. However;  hysteresis is brought in via adopting an nonideal elastic element;  which is also common in many automated devices. In this article;  we proposed a novel compensation algorithm to deal with the hysteresis;  which can be carried out in real time. Experimental results show that compared with the Bouc-Wen model and the PD model;  the proposed algorithm can solve the hysteresis of the LDNSA better. The proposed hysteresis compensation methodology can improve the performance of a rehabilitation robot for shoulder training with a modularized LDNSA.
