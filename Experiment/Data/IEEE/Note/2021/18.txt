The ever-changing customer demands;  the volatile market;  and the trend of mass personalization require manufacturing systems to be smart in the event of uncertainties. To this end;  information sharing in the supply chain is a key factor. However;  there are several barriers in implementing a cross-organizational information system;  including security;  access privileges;  and system interoperability. To lift these barriers;  this article proposes an ontology model and a hierarchical EDA. Compared with conventional architectures;  our approach facilitates the management of access privileges;  integration of interorganizational information systems;  and their interoperation. Moreover;  our approach is competitive compared with the conventional service-oriented architecture in terms of both scalability and reliability of the system. Before the proposed approach can be practically applied;  the ontology model needs to be further extended;  and the event registration and message exchange protocol need to be standardized.
