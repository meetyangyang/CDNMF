/i>\nâ€”To evaluate and predict production systems behavior;  managers of manufacturing operations need to know equipment reliability characteristics. Quantifying the equipment status by MTBF and MTTR;  this article provides answers to the following questions: Q1: How many measurements of machines up- and downtime are required to obtain reliable estimates of MTBF and MTTR? Q2: How long the observation period must be to collect the desired number of measurements? The answer to Q1 is provided by a rule (formula);  which is based on the desired estimate accuracy (characterized by \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\alpha $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n) and its likelihood (quantified by \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\beta $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n). The answer to Q2 consists of selecting a small number of initial measurements;  which can be used to calculate an upper bound of the total observation time.
