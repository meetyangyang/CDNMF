This article was inspired by the problemthat the control mode of the prosthetic leg walking is not naturaland intuitive, but it can also be applicable to other poweredprosthetic limbs. Existing methods of controlling the walkingpatterns of the prosthetic leg usually require explicit humanmanipulation and are not convenient to use. In this article, a novelstrategy was proposed, that is, using the human mind to choosethe ambulation mode of prosthetic legs. This article describedthe methods of human brain activity information acquisition andintention recognition. Then, gaits inspired by the healthy leg aredesigned for the prosthetic leg in three terrains, including walkingon the floor, ascending stairs, and descending stairs. In addition,this article provided a way for human to perceive the movementof prosthetic legs, which can make human control the prostheticleg more smoothly. Experiments on healthy subjects have shown that this approach is feasible. However, no experiments have beenconducted on lower limb amputees, and adding more walkingpatterns may reduce the accuracy of human intention recognition.In the future work, we will study how to accurately identify morecategories of human intentions and further improve the controlstrategy so as to enhance the auxiliary effect of prosthetic legson amputees.
