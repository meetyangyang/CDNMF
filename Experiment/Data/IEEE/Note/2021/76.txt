/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the need to perform persistent monitoring in applications;  such as border patrol and perimeter surveillance. Unmanned aerial and ground robots can be used to perform these activities uninterruptedly. However;  aerial robots have limited fuel capacity and need periodic refueling. Hence;  the number of refueling depots and their placement within the environment also affects the monitoring task. Also;  due to terrain variation;  robots are subject to limited visibility. Therefore;  we need to consider refueling constraints and terrain visibility aspects while planning optimal routes for the robots to perform visual monitoring. In this article;  we present a general optimal routing formulation to compute exact solutions. We also present a fast heuristic for real-time applications that produce feasible solutions. The algorithms are validated in simulations. We also show a proof of concept using experiments in limited outdoor settings.
