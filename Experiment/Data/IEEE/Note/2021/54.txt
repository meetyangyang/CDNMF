/i>\n—The proposed method is motivated by two challenges in industrial structured light (SL) system calibration: 1) robustness against imperfect planarity of the calibration target and 2) the number of SL projections per pose. In many industrial SL-based 3-D reconstruction systems;  the calibration accuracy greatly affects the reconstruction reliability. Our SL calibration system explicitly deals with calibration target’s imperfect planarity and thus outperforms the existing methods in terms of system accuracy. Another advantage of our SL calibration system is single-shot-per-pose;  allowing fast recalibration and reducing the decoding error due to slight pattern misalignment in multishot methods \n<xref ref-type=\bibr\ rid=\ref37\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>[37]</xref>\n. In addition;  we release the open-source calibration software with a graphical user interface (GUI);  with which calibration and sparse 3-D reconstruction can be easily performed without any further instructions. Moreover;  considering the complex calibration environment and setup;  we make the camera and projector imaging parameters;  such as exposure;  brightness;  and contrast;  adjustable through widgets and preview. Finally;  a limitation of our color-coded SL system is its sensitivity to environment lighting and target texture. This problem may be solved by projector photometric compensation \n<xref ref-type=\bibr\ rid=\ref16\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>[16]</xref>\n;  \n<xref ref-type=\bibr\ rid=\ref18\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>[18]</xref>\n;  \n<xref ref-type=\bibr\ rid=\ref19\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>[19]</xref>\n;  \n<xref ref-type=\bibr\ rid=\ref39\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>[39]</xref>\n.
