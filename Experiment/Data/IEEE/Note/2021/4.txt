This article proposes a prediction modelto forecast the idle duration of the manufacturing machines ina typical multi-machine and multi-buffer manufacturing system.With this predicted result, two concerns in energy control for theidle machine, i.e., throughput protection and energy consumptionreduction, can be more accurately modeled in decision-makingprocedure. Optimal energy control actions under the constraints of throughput maintaining and energy saving can be identifiedand implemented considering different warmup energy consumption and warmup time of the machines to reduce the energy wastefor those machines in idle states without any production and thus,improve the energy efficiency of the entire manufacturing system
