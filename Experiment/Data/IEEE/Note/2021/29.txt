This article is inspired by limited access to the manipulation of laparoscopic surgery under a kinematic constraint at the point of incision. Current commercial surgical robots are mostly operated by teleoperation;  which is representing less autonomy on surgery. Assisting and enhancing the surgeon's performance by increasing the autonomy of surgical robots has fundamental importance. The technique of teaching by demonstration (TbD) is capable of transferring the manipulation skills from human to humanoid robots by employing active learning of multiple demonstrated tasks. With the improved ability to interact with humans;  such as flexibility and compliance;  the new generation of serial robots becomes more and more popular in nonclinical research. Thus;  advanced control strategies are required by integrating cognitive functions and learning techniques into the processes of surgical operation between robots;  surgeon;  and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In this article;  we propose a novel methodology to model the manipulation skill from multiple demonstrations and execute the learned operations in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RA-MIS) by using a decoupled controller to respect the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint exploiting the redundancy of the robot. The developed control scheme has the following functionalities: 1) it enables the 3-D manipulation skill modeling after multiple demonstrations of the surgical tasks in open surgery by integrating dynamic time warping (DTW) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based dynamic movement primitive (DMP) and 2) it maintains the RCM constraint in a smaller safe area while performing the learned operation in RA-MIS. The developed control strategy can also be potentially used in other industrial applications with a similar scenario.
