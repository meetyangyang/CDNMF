The proposed intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture can be implemented modularly in a metal additive manufacturing (AM) machine that possesses the capability of estimating the coating and printing qualities of the AM process by extracting features from the optical data of the melt pools and chamber layer by layer. The estimated indices and qualities can be derived online using parallel computation to timely diagnose the machine issues and control the process of the next layer. Hence, when an AM machine is equipped with the IAMM architecture, it can efficiently manufacture a 3-D part with reduced defects in real time.
