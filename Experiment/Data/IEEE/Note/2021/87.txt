Motivated by the fact that the industrial process often has different modes and they may have common patterns, this article proposes a structure dictionary learning method for multimode process monitoring. First, the structure dictionary learning method was proposed to extract the common pattern and mode-specific pattern of each mode. After two different patterns are extracted, the control limit for process monitoring can be obtained from the training data. When new data arrive, the monitoring process can be carried out. Intensive experimental results show that the proposed method performs better than other conventional methods. Compared to conventional methods, the proposed approach overcomes the assumption that each operation mode of the industrial process should be modeled separately. Therefore, it can effectively detect faulty states. Above all, it is suitable for monitoring of real industrial systems.
