/i>\nâ€”Hypersonic vehicles have drawn significant interests due to the features of super-fast and flexible maneuverability. The use of advanced fault-tolerant control (FTC) techniques is expected to guarantee safety during hypersonic vehicle operation. A challenging problem is how to counteract actuator faults promptly and effectively in the presence of practical constraints and model uncertainties. This article presents a fixed-time FTC algorithm for a hypersonic gliding vehicle.
