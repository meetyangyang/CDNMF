/i>\n—Industrial processes in general have nonstationary characteristics which are ubiquitous in real world data;  often reflected by a time-variant mean;  a time-variant autocovariance;  or both resulting from various factors. The focus of this study is to develop a universal analytics and monitoring method for wide-range nonstationary and transient continuous processes. Condition-driven concept takes the place of time-driven thought. For the first time;  it is recognized that there are similar process characteristics within the same condition slice and changes in the process correlations may relate to its condition modes. Besides;  the proposed method can provide enhanced physical interpretation for the monitoring results with concurrent analysis of the static and dynamic information which carry different information;  analogous to the concepts of “position” and “velocity” in physics;  respectively. The static information can tell the current operation condition;  while the dynamic information can clarify whether the process status is switching between different steady states. It is noted that the condition-driven concept is universal and can be extended to other applications for industrial manufacturing applications.
