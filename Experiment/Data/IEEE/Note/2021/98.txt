Since the renewable energy generation has a spatial correlation among regional countries;  global energy interconnection (GEI) aims to combine several power systems together to promote the renewable energy accommodation. However;  two problems need to be considered: 1) Information Privacy: The information privacy of the power system in each country should be preserved;  which prevents the GEI from conducting a centralized optimal dispatch framework and 2) Uncertainty: The uncertain output of renewable energy resources brings challenge to the power system secure operation. The main contribution of this article is to set up a zonally robust decentralized optimization for the GEI;  where the zonally robust economic dispatch (ED) is conducted by the area control error (ACE) system to manage the difference between scheduled and actual generation under the uncertainties;  and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) algorithm is adopted for decentralizing the zonally adjustable robust ED model;  which only needs limited information. In particular;  this article uses a real-world example from Northeast Asian Countries to help engineers understand the advantages of the GEI and the new dispatch framework.
