/i>\n—In view of a foreseeable transition toward self-optimizing factories whereby machines and parts have communication and computational capabilities;  a novel “price-based” distributed and asynchronous method to coordinate a system consisting of distributed subsystems is developed. Under realistic assumptions of finite communication and solve times;  method convergence is proven. Numerical testing of generalized assignment problems through simulation demonstrates that the method converges fast and provides near-optimal results;  paving the way for self-optimizing factories in the future. Accompanying CPLEX codes and data are included.
