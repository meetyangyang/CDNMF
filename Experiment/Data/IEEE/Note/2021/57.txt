/i>\n—The high-speed atomic force microscopy (AFM) plays an increasingly vital role in observing and manipulating objects at the nanoscale. In the raster scanning of AFMs;  the most challenging issue is the triangular trajectory tracking of nanopositioning stages with high precision. Although the odd-harmonic repetitive control (ORC) has been successfully applied to improve the tracking performance;  the conventional ORC would amplify the tracking errors distributed at the frequencies other than the odd harmonics;  especially those at the even harmonics;  resulting from the inherent complicated hysteresis nonlinearity. This problem of amplifying the tracking errors would lead to larger tracking errors;  deteriorating the performance of AFM imaging. To address this issue;  this article proposes an enhanced ORC using the spectrum-selection filtering scheme to improve the loop-shaping property of the ORC;  so as to eliminate the problem of amplifying the tracking errors while preserving the advantages of the conventional ORC;  such as fast convergence speed and low computation cost. The experimental results show that;  with this simple modification;  the positioning errors are reduced greatly;  all-the-while preserving the benefits of the conventional ORC scheme– fast convergence speed and low computation cost. In terms of tracking accuracy and the simple structure;  this development can be easily implemented to other systems that challenge from the tracking accuracy under ORC scheme.
