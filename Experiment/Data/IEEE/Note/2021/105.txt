This article is motivated by the desire to deal with the regulation and disturbance rejection of the overhead crane system. In practical applications;  uncertainties/disturbances are unavoidable problems for overhead cranes. For most existing methods;  these issues are usually addressed in a robust way. To handle these existing problems;  a nonlinear disturbance observer and a continuous global sliding mode controller are proposed for the regulation and disturbance estimation control of the overhead crane system. The disturbance observer is introduced to estimate and compensate for uncertain disturbances;  and the sliding mode controller is designed to guarantee the convergence of the state variables of the closed-loop system. In the future;  we will try to apply this method to practical overhead cranes.
