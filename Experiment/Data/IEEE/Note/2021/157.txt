/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by two acute problems encountered in geometric variation simulation analysis for compliant parts in the early design stage. First;  form errors of the nonrigid part are not fully captured in existing methods. Second;  variation visualization can significantly enhance understanding of the geometric variation effects;  but it is difficult to achieve under existing approaches. Inspired by the idea of a parametric space envelope;  this article proposes a new methodology by building a variation tool to aid the task. Under the proposal;  the geometric variation of the compliant part is indirectly modeled through the constructed variation tool. This indirect modeling enables capturing intrapart interactions that are the major source of the inaccuracy of existing methods. The simulated geometric variation can be visualized through the variation tool. In addition;  the developed method does not rely on historical manufacturing experience. This can be valuable for early stage designer when such production information is not available or expensive to get. Furthermore;  the proposed method can be integrated into existing computer-aided design (CAD);  computer-aided manufacturing (CAM);  and computer-aided engineering (CAE) systems to improve overall design quality and reduce reliance on multiple physical prototyping.
