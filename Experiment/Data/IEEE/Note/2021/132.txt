/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the potential to further the state of the art of what is possible to achieve with autonomous robots when;  instead of using one single robot;  a group of robots cooperates self-reliantly to solve a task. The scenario studied in this article is a transportation task in which the robots shall cooperatively push an object to transport it along the desired path. The scheme proposed in this article deals with all major aspects of solving this transportation task;  with simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments showing the practical applicability of the scheme. While the experiments have been conducted in a laboratory environment;  one may readily imagine a more productive application;  e.g.;  in logistics;  when employing suitably designed hardware. On another note;  maybe more importantly;  the general architecture devised to solve the present task may serve as an inspiration or blueprint for the development of decision-making and control schemes that deal with alternative cooperative robotic tasks;  especially with regard to the usage of optimization-based schemes on multiple levels allowing a flexible;  yet still intuitive problem formulation.
