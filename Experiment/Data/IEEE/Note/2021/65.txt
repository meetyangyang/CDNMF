/i>\n—Accurate real-time tracking in an unknown environment is a challenging task;  especially if high accuracy is needed. In physiotherapy;  analyzing the daily recorded data (data acquired from a patient’s body movement) will be beneficial in the process of rehabilitation. However;  keeping the daily record of patient body motion during exercise is a difficult task in most of the circumstances;  which is due to the nonavailability of precise portable devices for accurate motion tracking. In this article;  a solution for tracking the patient’s motion (during physiotherapy) using a small hand-held device is presented. For this purpose;  simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is used;  which;  according to the best of our knowledge;  is not used in the field of physiotherapy before. In the first part of this article;  we present an extensive analysis of a few SLAM algorithms based on power;  memory consumption;  CPU heat;  and CPU utilization. Based on these results;  we select the best algorithm EMoVI-SLAM;  and then;  we extend the work of this article by modifying EMoVI-SLAM. We propose a new SLAM algorithm called stereo visual-inertial tracking (S-VIT). The proposed algorithm is compared with the EMoVI-SLAM on our data set. We collect the data set of various movements of the lower limb. The result shows that S-VIT outperforms EMoVI-SLAM.
