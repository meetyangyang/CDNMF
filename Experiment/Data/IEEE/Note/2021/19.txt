The problem of conflict-free routing and scheduling of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in large-scale manufacturing systems has been an ever-present challenge for many AGV companies. Although these companies have developed rather efficient control policies and algorithms;  retrofitting the existing heuristic to future's denser;  more complicated;  and more demanding AGV layouts is not guaranteed to be easy. Furthermore;  the installed system will not necessarily be as efficient as expected. Currently;  it is common to use heuristics to allocate vehicles to orders and route them. There are also rules of thumbs to avoid collisions and deadlocks. However;  with increasing demand for high-performance AGV solutions;  it is of interest to employ optimization algorithms that handle the order allocation;  scheduling;  and routing in a more efficient way. In this article;  we present an improved method to tackle this issue;  with promising results. We have developed our work in collaboration with a Swedish AGV company;  and we have investigated a real-large-scale industrial instance as our case study.
