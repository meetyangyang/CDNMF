This article is motivated by the criticalproblem of balancing the trade-offs between production scheduling and maintenance in a flow shop production line, where jobsare processed on the machines in the same route. On the onehand, production scheduling aims to meet the customer demandson time. On the other hand, the maintenance actions help restorethe machinesâ€™ reliability by reducing the machine failure rate.Most existing approaches to scheduling the PM are based onthe fixed PM interval, which is rigid and may lead to poorperformance. Although the nonperiodic PM interval strategy hasbeen proposed in the literature for production scheduling, it stilldoes not consider the adaptive PM strategy in the context of flowshop scheduling with multiple machines. To fill this literaturegap, in this article, we first model a generic M-machine flowshop considering both the CM and PM. Then, we suggest anew adaptive and easy-to-implement approach to dynamicallyupdate the PM interval and improve the decision-making on the PM schedules. Compared with the conventional maintenancepolicy, the adaptive one greatly reduces the total cost in real-timescheduling.
