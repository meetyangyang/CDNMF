/i>\n—This article is motivated by the problem of automated identification of the inputs that influence the variance of the output for networked processes without feedback control. Such processes arise in various natural and engineered systems;  of which manufacturing operations and flood mitigation are of particular interest to us;  where the output variance represents the uncertainty in productivity;  quality;  or cost. Therefore;  influential inputs’ identification allows us to quantify the effects of the various process parameters;  such as operating conditions and physical properties;  in determining the uncertainties in the process outputs. We show that our identification method is guaranteed to quantify the effects accurately and is expected to do so more efficiently (with fewer experimental observations) than widely used stochastic sampling techniques. In the future;  we will like to evaluate the usefulness of the developed method on large-scale manufacturing and supply chain networks in actual production facilities as well as on critical infrastructures subject to cascading failures.
