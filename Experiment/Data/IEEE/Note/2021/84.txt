/i>\nâ€”In practice;  resource failures in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) are common. Deadlock prevention control in AMSs allowing resource failures has gained more and more attention from researchers and practitioners. Most prior research is based on the enumeration of either siphons or perfect resource transition circuits whose number exponentially increases with the system scale. This means that the synthesized supervisor has a much complex structure. In this article;  based on a special kind of circuits at a deadlock marking detected by using a set of mathematical formulations;  we develop an effective and efficient method for AMSs with multiple unreliable resources to iteratively control deadlocks such that the controlled system can continue to operate smoothly even if some unreliable resources fail. The computational and comparative results show that our proposed approach can acquire more permissive states with a simpler supervisor.
