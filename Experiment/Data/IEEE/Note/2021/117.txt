This article is motivated by the problem of using the battery storage capacities of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in a corporate energy system (CES) such as an iron and steel plant;  aiming at minimizing the energy cost. In existing studies;  behaviors of PEVs (e.g.;  arriving or leaving time) have usually been elusive since they are directly decided by drivers;  and thus;  it is difficult to determine how much storage capacity PEVs can provide. However;  in a CES where a shift-work regulation is implemented;  employees should arrive or leave punctually during each shift;  and the same is true of their PEVs. Based on this fact;  PEVs within one shift could show weakened randomness and stable storage capacities. In this article;  the influences of the shift-work regulation on the PEVs are fully analyzed;  and the shift-working V2G provides an easy way to integrate PEVs into the CES. In practice;  the shift-working V2G model can be applied to any energy system that also implements a shift-work regulation;  such as a fire station.
