Complex manufacturing schedulingproblems are usually solved via intelligent optimization algorithms. However, most of them are parameter-sensitive, andthus selecting their proper parameters is highly challenging.On the other hand, it is difficult to ensure their robustnesssince they heavily rely on some random mechanisms. In orderto deal with the above obstacles, we design a knowledge-basedintelligent optimization algorithm. In the proposed algorithm,a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to self-adjust its parameters to tackle the parameter selection issue. Two probability matrices for machine allocation and operation sequencingare built via hybrid heuristics as a guide for searching a new andefficient assignment scheme. To further improve the performanceof our algorithm, a feedback control framework is constructed toensure the desired state of population. As a result, our algorithmcan obtain a high-quality schedule in a reasonable time tofulfill a real-time scheduling purpose. In addition, it possesseshigh robustness via the proposed feedback control technique.Simulation results show that the knowledge-based cuckoo searchalgorithm (KCSA) outperforms well some existing algorithms.Hence, it can be readily applied to real manufacturing facilityscheduling problems.
