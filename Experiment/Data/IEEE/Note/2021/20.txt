Smart production is an umbrella for a number of shifts and initiatives that deal with digitization of manufacturing/production systems and related issues and potentials. In this work;  we present an approach for utilizing automated planning for creating production plans. This is in contrast to the traditional approach;  where recipes are programmed into the production system ahead-of-time. However;  automated planning relies on specific languages and tools that are hard to master by nonexperts;  which is a factor that strongly limited the utilization of plan-driven approaches for industrial automation in practice. Thus;  we propose to generate planning tasks automatically with model-driven engineering techniques. We are utilizing the industrial standard IEC 62264 for the description of the production system;  and the academic standard Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for planning. PDDL is handled completely transparent to the user;  that is the user is shielded from its complexity by employing the IEC 62264 model as the sole frontend.
