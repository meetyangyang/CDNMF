/i>\n—This article was motivated by considering the anisotropic positional uncertainty into the rigid point set (PS) registration in the application of preoperative-to-intraoperative registration within image-guided surgery. We provide iterative solutions that compute the rotation and translation vector that aligns two 3-D PSs. The correspondences between points in two PSs are not known and regarded as hidden variables in the optimization process. Expectation–maximization technique is utilized to solve the maximum likelihood problem. We have demonstrated through experiments that our proposed approach can achieve lower registration error values than the compared state-of-the-art registration methods on various data sets. The readers should note that the proposed method is particularly suitable for cases that anisotropic noise is involved.
