/i>\nâ€”This article was inspired by existing work on interlocking joinery structures;  modular robots;  and construction robots. We present designs for two interlocking blocks that can be assembled into larger rigid structures. Blocks of this type are a promising future construction material. Only translation is needed to assemble the blocks;  simplifying robotic assembly;  and the mortarless construction allows for later disassembly and reuse of the blocks. We propose an algorithm that lays out blocks into desired shapes in series and developed a dual-robot system to assemble 48 blocks automatically. Our physical experiments show that joint manufacturing precision is critical to the ease of construction and the rigidity of the finished structure. We also present a layout algorithm that enables parallel assembly;  allowing multiple robots to work on the same structure.
