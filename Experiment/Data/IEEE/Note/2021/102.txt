This article was motivated by achieving compliant interaction between PM-actuated exoskeletons and human when conducting task-specific gait training. Due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of PM, it is challenging to establish a mathematical model to precisely predict real-time compliance of the powered joints. This article suggests a new strategy that adopts the average pressure of flexor and extensor PMs as the feedback to synchronously realize the joint position control and compliance regulation. A novel experimental approach was adopted to validate the system capability on adjusting the compliance from human usersâ€™ perception. This article provides a new insight between the controlled PM pressure and the desired joint compliance, which would be essential for the future design of PM-actuated exoskeletons.
