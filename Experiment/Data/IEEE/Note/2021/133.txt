/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the problem that the performance of fabric defect detection in the textile industry is poor. It is necessary to develop an effective method to improve the defect detection accuracy and reduce overall manufacturing cost. Existing automatic defect detection approaches usually contain two stages: first;  capture fabric images from the weaving machine and then use a defect detection algorithm in a host computer to conduct a real-time inspection and give an alarm if defects occur. This article focuses on locating defects for given defective images after the procedure of binary classification (which determines an image as defective or defect free). The article proposes an objective function to mathematically interpret the optimization problem between fabric images and predictive defects. The optimal solution can be obtained by employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). The proposed method is described as a new defect detection algorithm. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the algorithm;  and the experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to many existing fabric defect detection methods. Preliminary experiments suggest that this method is feasible but has not yet been really used in production. In future research;  we will collect more fabric images from the textile industry and develop large-scale databases for verifying the proposed method for real-life applications.
