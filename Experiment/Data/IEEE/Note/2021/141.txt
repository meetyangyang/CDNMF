/i>\n—This article was motivated by the problem of robust trajectory tracking for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operating in an uncertain environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace (e.g.;  obstacle positions) is constantly updated online via the vehicle’s onboard sensors (e.g.;  multibeam imaging sonars and laser-based vision systems). In addition;  there may be other system limitations (e.g.;  thruster saturation limits) and other operational constraints;  induced by the need of various common underwater tasks (e.g.;  a predefined vehicle speed limit for inspecting the seabed;  and mosaicking);  where it should also be considered into the control strategy. However;  based on the existing trajectory tracking control approaches for underwater robotics;  there is a lack of an autonomous control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Based on this;  we present a reliable control strategy that takes into account the aforementioned issues;  along with dynamic uncertainties of the model and the presence of ocean currents. In future research;  we will extend the proposed methodology for multiple AUV performing collaborative inspection tasks in an uncertain environment.
