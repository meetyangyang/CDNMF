This article is motivated by the challenging problem due to the inadequacy of labeled data in medical image analysis and the dispersion of efficient features in high-resolution medical images. As for the inadequacy of labeled data in medical image analysis;  the reasons mainly include the followings: 1) the high-quality annotation of medical imaging sample depends heavily on scarce medical expertise which is very expensive and 2) comparing with natural issues;  it is more difficult to collect medical images because of privacy issues. It is of great significance to apply deep-learning techniques for diabetic retinopathy (DR) recognition. In this article;  the multichannel generative adversarial network (GAN) with semisupervision is developed for DR-aided diagnosis. The proposed model can deal with DR classification problem with inadequacy of labeled data in the following ways: 1) the multichannel generative scheme is proposed to generate a series of subfundus images corresponding to the scattering DR features and 2) the proposed multichannel-based GAN (MGAN) model with semisupervision can make full use of both labeled data and unlabeled data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the other representative models in terms of accuracy;  area under ROC curve (AUC);  sensitivity;  and specificity.
