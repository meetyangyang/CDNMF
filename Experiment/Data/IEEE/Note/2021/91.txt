Smart customization has been adopted by various industries to tailor companies' business streams and customize solutions for customers. It is a complicated service process involving cross-functional teams for identifying customer needs and establishing product design and manufacturing specifications. However;  communication in the collaborative process may be challenging. Customers may express their needs using layman's terms. The expressed needs can even be ambiguous and imprecise. Miscommunication hinders the efficiency of smart customization services.
