This article proposes a novel deep learning algorithm to enable the automated capability for cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) segmentation and lesion detection. Despite the growing adoption of CBCT in various dental specialties;  such capability is currently lacking. The proposed work will provide tools to help reduce subjectivity and human errors;  as well as streamline and expedite the clinical workflow. This will greatly facilitate dental care automation. Furthermore;  due to the capacity of integrating oral-anatomical knowledge into the deep learning design;  the proposed algorithm does not require many high-quality labeled images to train. The algorithm can provide good accuracy under limited training samples. This ability is highly desirable for practitioners by saving labor-intensive;  costly labeling efforts;  and enjoying the benefits provided by AI.
