The convenience of charging service is one major concern for EVs;  especially when an urgent charging is required while none charging points are reachable. Recently;  a Chinese EV company (NIO;  Inc.;  Shanghai;  China) is promoting its mobile charger (ES8 model) to Tesla. Driven by such market trend;  this article proposes an efficient approach toward intelligent scheduling of mobile chargers toward parked EVs. Different from fixed charging stations focusing on the problem of long waiting times;  the proposed solution is applicable to charging-on-demand with precharging appointment at mobile chargers. Preliminary experiments show great charging efficiency achieved by concerning the issue of where to reserve;  i.e.;  the consideration of optimal selection on mobile chargers. Such mobile charging services can coexist with the governmental or pilots' initiated charging station deployment. However;  future research will need to evaluate the holistic service platform.
