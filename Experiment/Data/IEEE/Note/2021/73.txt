/i>\nâ€”In a modern semiconductor fab;  there are hundreds of cluster tools for wafer fabrication. To ensure wafer quality;  it is important to reduce the wafer delay time in PMs of cluster tools after a wafer is processed since the high temperature;  chemical gas;  and particles in the PMs may damage the wafer. To do so;  this work proposes three algorithms with polynomial complexity to assign the robot idle time as robot waiting time such that the wafer delay time in PMs can be reduced as much as possible. Furthermore;  the obtained schedule by these algorithms is optimal in terms of the cycle time. Besides;  the developed algorithms can be easily embedded into the controller of cluster tools by facility engineers. Therefore;  this work has a practical value.
