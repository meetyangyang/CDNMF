/i>\n—Simulation is widely used to model complex and large-scale systems;  such as healthcare;  transportation;  and supply chain logistics. When optimizing these systems;  practitioners always assess overall performance by multiple indicators. Inspired by this issue;  this article focuses on a general problem that aims to optimize the system’s primary performance while keeping the secondary performance within limits. We propose an adaptive Gaussian process-based method called AGPS to search for a high-quality solution. The bright spot of AGPS is that it can intelligently determine the quality of a solution considering all the stochastic performance and adaptively search the solution space. The merit lightens the burden of practitioners to design specific parameters for different performance indicators. Numerical experiments demonstrate that AGPS can apply to the large-scale discrete optimization problems with smooth function values and shows higher efficiency than existing methods.
