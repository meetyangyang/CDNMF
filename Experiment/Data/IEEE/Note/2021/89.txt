The effect of a large population of PEVs on the power grid such as overload and voltage drop is inevitable. Motivated by this, there are many research articles which propose different centralized and decentralized charging coordination solutions to address this problem. The core idea in the most of literature is: “How to IMPLEMENT a demand response (DR) program appropriately for charging coordination problem to avoid high peak load?” However, none of them propose a practical algorithm on “How to DESIGN a DR optimally by having limited information from the clients?” We propose a bilevel optimization algorithm to both design a DR program (i.e., price function) and also implement DR program to flatten the demand curve, accordingly. Another advantage of the proposed method is that the information structure of the problem is close to reality. There is no information exchange among the clients and also the utility company does not need to know the private information of the clients. The Utility Company only knows the charging profile of the PEVs in each day and broadcasts the price signal to the clients for the next day. The method is illustrated in an IEEE 5-bus system that supports our claims.
