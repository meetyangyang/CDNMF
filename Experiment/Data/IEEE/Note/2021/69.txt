/i>\n—This work was motivated by the problem of missing values in industrial heterogeneous sensor readings. When data recovery is performed;  the process should consider multifactor nonlinearity;  lower/upper bounds;  historical references;  and the divergence between substituted values and references at the same time in order to reconstruct original sensor readings as many as possible. Existing approaches generally have solutions to linear or nonlinear equality constraints but not the aforementioned nonlinear inequality ones. This work designs a self-dictionary method—class-dependent and box-bounded imputation basis factors along with constrained iterative projection pursuit—for finding substituted values. Real industrial experiments were conducted based on \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\mathcal {L}_{2}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-norms. Future research will address the design for other norms.
