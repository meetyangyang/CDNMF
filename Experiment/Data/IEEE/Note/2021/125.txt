Machines consume a huge amount of energy in energy-intensive (i.e.;  high energy-consuming) production systems in;  e.g.;  automobile;  semiconductor;  and steel companies. Due to economic;  social;  and environmental concerns;  it is a high priority to consider ways to reduce the energy consumption in these production systems. In this article;  the problem of minimizing the total energy consumption in Bernoulli serial lines while maintaining the required production rate is investigated. Based on the aggregation method developed for performance analysis of long lines and the optimization results obtained for two-machine lines;  the energy consumption optimization problem for long Bernoulli serial lines is elaborately analyzed and a method is proposed to recursively solve its unique optimal solution (i.e.;  the optimal machine efficiencies). From the point of view of system operation;  this research;  which makes the system operate in the most energy-efficient manner;  offers a new managerial paradigm for the production systems.
