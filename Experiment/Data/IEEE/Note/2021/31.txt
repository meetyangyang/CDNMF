This article addresses the robustness of the hand gesture recognition system that is important for gesture recognition-based applications. Existing methods rely on either the large-volume data to train a deep learning model or to restrict the applied environments (e.g.;  an ideal environment without dynamic background). However;  a vision-based deep learning model requires large computational resources;  while the ideal environment limits the practicality of the system. In this work;  we introduce a biologically inspired neuromorphic vision sensor and an ALM glove and build a novel gesture recognition system to tackle the above issue. The neuromorphic vision sensor has a microsecond temporal resolution and a high dynamic range. With these properties;  the sensing system of our prototype operates in a very low-latency space;  which;  in turn;  ensures that our gesture recognition system is robust to illumination variance and dynamic background. Thus;  this work is valuable to the research of illumination-robust gesture recognition systems. Preliminary experiments suggest that our system prototype is feasible;  but it has not yet been incorporated into an online gesture recognition system nor tested with complex gestures. In future work;  we will concentrate on the improvement of the signal processing methods that advance the current system to complex and practical applications.
