Together with the growing adoption of EVs in modern societies;  there goes the challenge of how to satisfy the charging demand. Given the high uncertainty both in the wind power generation and in the charging demand;  it is important to make decisions online using up-to-date estimation on the renewable power generation and the charging demand. Simulation-based policy improvement (SBPI) is shown both theoretically and practically to be useful to improve a given base policy in various applications;  including this EV charging problem. However;  the high uncertainty in forecasting could sometimes make the output of SBPI worse than that of the base policy. In this work;  we first use numerical experiments to demonstrate the risk for such scenarios. Then;  we propose to use two computing budget allocation procedures to address this issue. The asymptotic optimality of both algorithms is briefly reviewed. We demonstrate their performance on numerical experiments when there are only several EVs and when there are 100 EVs.
