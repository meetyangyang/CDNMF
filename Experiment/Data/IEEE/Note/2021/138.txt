/i>\nâ€”The control of one drone is usually performed with a remote controller (similar to a joypad) that uses radio-wave signals. When controlling more than one drone;  even a simple task;  such as moving the whole team around;  becomes very challenging. Developing an easy;  yet efficient way to impart commands to a formation of drones is necessary to achieve any complex task. This article proposes a framework to control a fleet of drones (quadrotors) in an intuitive way while receiving meaningful and effective information on the state of the formation. The proposed technique does not rely on any absolute positioning system (e.g.;  GPS) or centralized command center. Instead;  it only uses the relative position of the drones with respect to each other;  and all computations are designed in a decentralized fashion. These features make the proposed framework ready for deployment in different high-impact applications;  such as in surveillance;  search-and-rescue;  and disaster response scenarios.
