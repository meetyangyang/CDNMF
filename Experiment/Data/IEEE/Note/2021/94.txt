The original motivation for this article derives from both the line-of-sight limitation and robust demand for optical tracking of surgical instruments. The performance of the multicamera optical tracking system (OTS) depends on its reconstruction model. However;  the geometric reconstruction model requires more calculation to obtain high accuracy;  which will enlarge the latency and reduce the update rate. In our previous work;  the reconstruction model based on the neural network (NN) has achieved accurate tracking in real-time;  while the training of the model tends into local optimal values. Hence;  we proposed the prior knowledge feedforward NN model to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover;  to guarantee the line-of-sight in the optical occlusion;  the state of camera combining with the gating technique enables the OTS to be self-adaptive for changing the field of view;  which greatly ensures the robust tracking process with larger workspace in case of line-of-sight obstructions.
