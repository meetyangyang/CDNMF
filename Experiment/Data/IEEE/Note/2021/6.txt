The optimization of manufacturingexecution is a long standing problem in production engineering.Modern engineering tools are available to monitor and helpdecision-makers to reduce waste and schedule resources tooptimize the efficiency of a manufacturing process. This articleproposes a scheduling algorithm that continuously collects datafrom the manufacturing process and iteratively plans an optimalresource allocation strategy, trying to reduce the idle time of eachagent. The approach is demonstrated on a realistic case study,where two robots and a human worker cooperate to assemble aUSB/microSD adapter.
