This article is motivated by the problem of assigning mobile robots (e.g.;  vehicles and drones) to goals when travel times from robot origins to goal locations are uncertain. Existing robust assignment methods deal with uncertainty by minimizing risk or by predefining acceptable risk thresholds. In this article;  we propose a complementary method that offers robustness to uncertainty by making use of robot redundancy. In other words;  we assign more robots than necessary to a given goal;  in the expectation that one of the redundant robots will reach the goal faster (than the originally assigned robot). However;  solving this redundant assignment problem is computationally intractable for large systems. By characterizing the mathematical problem;  we show how the redundant assignment problem can be solved efficiently. We apply our assignment algorithm to transport network problems to reduce the average waiting times at goal locations when travel times from vehicle origins to destinations are uncertain and potentially also correlated. Our results show that exploiting robot redundancy is an effective approach to reducing waiting times. In this work;  we build on the premise that time is the primary commodity;  and we do not explicitly model the additional cost of utilizing redundant robots. Future work should more explicitly address the tradeoff between the cost of providing redundancy (e.g.;  travel costs and robot costs) and performance gains.
