/i>\nâ€”Resource scheduling is one of the most important managerial issues in diverse industrial systems. An optimal scheduling method for a certain industrial system is often locally developed by utilizing domain-specific operational properties. Although such domain-dependent knowledge can contribute to enhancing the computational efficiency of an optimization method;  such an approach has a weak point that the method might not be applicable to scheduling problems of different industrial fields. Our motivation is to develop an algorithm for optimizing steady-state schedules that can be robustly applied for various types of discrete-event systems. The algorithm is developed on the basis of the Petri net modeling framework as it is widely being used for describing cyclic behaviors of diverse manufacturing systems;  service systems;  and social systems. It is experimentally shown that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient compared with the existing cyclic scheduling methods.
