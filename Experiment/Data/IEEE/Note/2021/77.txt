/i>\nâ€”Considering practical situations and requirements in industrial warehouses and automated logistics systems;  this article resolves the life-long planning and coordination problems of large-scale robot networks and ensures the practical execution performance in the presence of robot motion uncertainties and temporary communication disconnections. Our main idea is to reduce robot congestions and improve warehouse working efficiency by balancing the traffic flow in the whole environment. To achieve this;  we present a traffic flow prediction algorithm to estimate the robot density distribution in a future horizon and take this information into consideration in sector-level path planning. The reliability;  scalability;  and the real-time performance of the proposed solution are achieved by the presented hierarchical system framework and the dynamic planning scheme. The proposed concept and approach can also be used to coordinate other large-scale systems with multirobot or multi-AGV networks. Simulation and experimental results suggest that the proposed solution is effective and practically applicable;  but a saturation phenomenon of the system capacity can be observed under a very heavy workload. In the future;  we will investigate the relation between the maximum system capacity and the environment structure and make further efforts to optimize the environment structure and road layout in order to improve the warehouse working efficiency.
