This article is motivated by the problems of the diagnosis of negative symptoms in schizophrenia and the timely monitoring of schizophrenic patients. In clinic;  there exists a high patient-to-clinician ratio and the diagnostic result depends on the subjective experience of the clinician. It is necessary to develop an automatic and objective procedure for the diagnosis and monitoring of schizophrenic patients. Speech disorders are among the salient characteristics of negative symptoms. In this work;  an automatic procedure for detecting the negative symptoms based on speech signal processing is proposed. This automatic procedure is achieved based on three newly presented acoustic features involving the characteristics of schizophrenic speech;  which consider the speaking behavior of schizophrenic patients. This automatic procedure and the information of the three acoustic features may serve as an aid to clinicians and could potentially help them in providing better monitoring of schizophrenic patients.
