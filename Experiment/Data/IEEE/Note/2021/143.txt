/i>\nâ€”Nowadays;  practical engineering systems become more and more complex. In these systems;  the observation of events often becomes nondeterministic due to reasons such as sensor limitations;  sensor faults;  and packet losses in networks. Consider a mobile robot as an example. The availability of a sensor output may depend on the current location of the mobile robot. If the mobile robot is in an area where the wireless network is unreliable;  the sensor output may not be received by the supervisor. In this article;  we investigate the state estimation problem for practical engineering systems under nondeterministic observations within a discrete-event system framework. The results in this article provide not only insights for engineers in the automatic control field to understand nondeterministic observations in practical systems but also the methodology to estimate the current discrete state that is always an important issue. Therefore;  we believe that the engineers in the automatic control field should be interested in this article and can benefit from it.
