/i>\n—This article was motivated by the expensive and time-consuming process of designing tactile skin for robots. When designing pressure-sensitive whole-body sensor arrays for physical human–robot interaction;  there are tradeoffs related to sensor resolution;  accuracy;  and response time;  among others. Instead of building prototypes and evaluating them experimentally;  the SkinSim simulation environment allows automatic testing of skins with simultaneous consideration of sensing element geometry and mechanical structure;  signal quality;  data processing;  and closed-loop force controller performance. The user can specify several configurations to test and thereby explore the best tradeoffs before actually prototyping any hardware.
