/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the problem of characterizing nonprocessed signals for automatic machine health monitoring. Practically;  nonprocessed signals;  such as vibration signals;  acoustic signals;  and so on;  cannot directly be applied to reflect machine health conditions. The transformation of nonprocessed signals by using health indices into process signals is great of a concern. Most existing methods directly use intuition and experience to choose health indices in order to realize machine health monitoring. Thus;  these methods do not provide theoretical investigations and support to illustrate how health indices characterize nonprocessed signals generated from a faulty machine. This article uses mathematical models and inferences to explain how popular health indices characterize impulsive signals generated from a faulty machine. Then;  it is shown that direct applications of popular health indices in a time domain are sensitive to impulsive noises;  which causes failures of health indices for machine health monitoring in the occurrence of impulsive noises. To solve this problem;  it is suggested to use indices to characterize frequency information of faulty signals. Finally;  an efficient and reliable fusion of health indices in a frequency domain is proposed for machine health monitoring.
