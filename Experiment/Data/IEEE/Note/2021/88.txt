This article is motivated by the problem of the flexible manipulation of tiny object in 3-D space. The proposed nanorobotic manipulation system, two micropipettes and feedforward compensation model control strategy could realize the precise translational and rotational manipulation of microbeads in 3-D space, which offers obvious advantages of existing techniques. The proposed system and method could be a general solution for precise and flexible micromanipulation. Thus, it could find wide applications ranging from fundamental research to industrial applications, such as biological cell positioning, characterization of a particular micro/nanoregion, microassembly, and manufacturing.
