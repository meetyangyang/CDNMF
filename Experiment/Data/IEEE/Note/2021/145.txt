/i>\nâ€”The defect recognition on wafer maps plays a key role to recognize fault sources of the semiconductor manufacturing processes. Transfer learning is able to use the existing labeled data to assist in the classification of unlabeled data and is very effective to solve the problem of small samples and nonstationary generalization errors. In particular;  the infusion of adversarial learning in transfer learning will provide a new idea for deep feature learning. This article provides a novel method based on transfer learning to implement wafer map defect recognition (WMDR) to quickly identify defect root causes for yield enhancement. This article provides a novel way for quality control of semiconductor manufacturing processes based on transfer and adversarial learning.
