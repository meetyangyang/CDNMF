This article is motivated by the precise 3-D surface reconstruction problem in automated robotic systems. In different scenarios;  such as the reconstruction of the static objects or moving objects;  the errors induced by sensor noise and motion should be taken into consideration. To enhance the measurement precision under these occasions;  selection of pattern number and fringe frequencies has been a problem. To overcome these problems;  this article proposes a novel framework for active stereo 3-D surface reconstruction. The framework utilizes multifrequency phase-shifting fringes to encode the reconstructed target. Then;  a multistep matching method filters the candidates step by step to obtain the most precise corresponding pixel and avoid noise error accumulation. A refinement method is introduced to further improve the precision. Selection strategies of the number of matching steps;  the fringe frequencies;  and matching thresholds enable the 3-D reconstruction framework to be utilized on different occasions. In applications;  limitations of the proposed method should be noted.
