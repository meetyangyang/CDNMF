/i>\nâ€”The motivation of this article is to solve the problem of controlling the movement of a wireless capsule endoscope in the human intestine to assist intestinal diagnosis and treatment. We present a feasible system design and corresponding algorithms to achieve closed-loop simultaneous actuation and localization of a robotic capsule. The design of a simple structure placed inside the capsule (i.e.;  two magnetic rings) and an external sensor array mounted on the examination bed can reduce the size and power consumption of the capsule;  and the use of a rotating actuator helps improve the actuation efficiency. The proposed SMAL framework;  which is composed of state detection;  interference removal;  multimodel localization;  and actuator updating;  can close the actuation-localization loop and improve the accuracy and robustness of the system. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared with others through extensive experiments. In the future;  our SMAL system can be combined with image- or ultrasound-based automatic diagnosis and is expected to provide doctors with better tools for digestive examinations.
