/i>\nâ€”Requirements on safety and responsiveness for collaborative robots have driven a need for new ideas in control design that bridge between standard objectives in low-level control (such as trajectory tracking) and high-level behavioral objectives (such as collision avoidance) often relegated to planning systems. Modern results from geometric control;  which promise stable controllers that can smoothly and safely transition between many behavioral tasks;  therefore;  become highly relevant. However;  for years;  this field has remained inaccessible due to its mathematical complexity. This article aims to: 1) make those ideas accessible to robotics and control experts by recasting them in a concrete algorithmic framework amenable to controller design and 2) to additionally generalize them to better satisfy the specific needs of robotic behavior generation. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting controllers can engender natural behavior that adapts instantaneously to changing surroundings with zero planning while performing manipulation tasks. The framework is gaining traction within the robotics community;  finding increasing application in areas;  such as autonomous navigation;  tactile servoing;  and multi-agent systems. Future research will address learning these controllers from data to simplify that process of design and tuning;  which at present can require experience.
