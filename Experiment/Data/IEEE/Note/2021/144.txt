/i>\n—With the development of consumer-level RGB-D cameras;  industries have started to employ these low-cost sensors in many robotic and automation applications. However;  images generated by consumer-level RGB-D cameras are generally in low resolution. Moreover;  the depth images often have incomplete regions when the surface of an object is transparent;  highly reflective;  or beyond the distance of sensing. With the help of our method;  engineers are able to “repair” the images captured by consumer-level RGB-D cameras in high efficiency. As the typical deep-learning networks are employed in this approach;  the proposed approach fits well with the GPU-based hardware architecture of deep-learning computation—therefore;  it potentially can be integrated into the hardware of RGB-D cameras.
