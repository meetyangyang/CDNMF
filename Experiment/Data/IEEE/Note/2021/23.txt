This article was motivated by the problem that the four-degree of freedom (DoF) underactuated paraplegic rehabilitation lower limb exoskeleton robot lacks of the center of gravity (COG) transfer process when coordinating with paraplegia patients during the training process for beginner. The existing approach to deal with this problem generally is to train the pilot for obtaining the COG transfer ability by using crutches. This article suggests a gait planning method for the four-DOF underactuated rehabilitation lower limb exoskeleton robot considering the COG transfer process to make the exoskeleton robot coordinate with a pilot and ensure safety. The gait planning method is based on the inverted pendulum model and simplified to several parameters. By adjusting these parameters;  the step length;  step height;  walking speed;  and the shape of gait can be adjusted according to the requirements of the exoskeleton robot and pilot. In this article;  we mathematically characterize a gait planning method for the exoskeleton control strategy. Preliminary online experiments suggest that this approach is feasible and can significantly reduce the arm muscle output of pilot. In future research;  we will adjust the gait by estimating the velocity of center of mass (COM) of the pilot to make the exoskeleton robot coordinate with pilot actively.
