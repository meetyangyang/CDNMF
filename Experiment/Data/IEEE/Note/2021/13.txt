As is well known;  reducing the energy consumption and improving the energy efficiency in energy-intensive production systems are of great significance. In practical production systems;  due to physical limitations;  machine efficiencies are usually confined to a subset of (0;  1]. Although for the case without machine-efficiency restrictions (i.e.;  the efficiencies can be selected in (0;  1]);  the problems of reducing the energy consumption and improving the energy efficiency have been investigated for some production systems;  the machine-efficiency-constrained problems;  which are more practical and challenging;  have not been examined yet. In this article;  two problems;  which minimize the total energy consumption and the energy consumption per job in the two-machine Bernoulli line;  respectively;  are formulated and solved. In the future;  this research will be extended to long Bernoulli lines and systems with geometric;  exponential;  and nonexponential machine reliability models;  and the results obtained will be implemented in practical production systems.
