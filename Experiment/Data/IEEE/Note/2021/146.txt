/i>\nâ€”This article proposes a control strategy for the roll-to-roll (R2R) printing system;  particularly for printing systems with electronic line shafts. Few existing studies have been done in detailedly analyzing the upstream register controls and the downstream register errors. This article establishes a mechanical model of printing registration and gives a systematic analysis of the complete relationship between upstream register controls and downstream register errors and then proposes a control strategy based on the Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed method can be extended to other similar R2R systems. Simulation and industrial examples show that the control method is more feasible and effective compared with the existing methods. In future work;  we will study a control method combined with the mechanical model and data model in different R2R systems.
