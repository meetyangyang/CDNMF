This article presented a new robotic somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) process. This new robotic SCNT process introduced a microfluidic groove for oocyte storage and two micropipettes for oocyte enucleation and oocyte injection, respectively. We save much operating time since the operating area switching, objective lens conversing, and focusing on traditional SCNT process were eliminated, and oocyte localization was simplified. Experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency and reproducibility of the new robotic SCNT process. This new robotic SCNT process has great potential for many other applications, e.g., ICSI, embryo microinjection, and cell biopsy. Commercialization of the proposed technology may lead to the improvement in SCNT industry. In current experiments, the somatic cells sometimes were injected at the same time, which led to the failure of the experiments. In the future, we will apply control algorithms to control the motion of multiple cells.
