/i>\n—This article is motivated by the goal of using a social robot to perform geriatric well-being assessment through clinical screening interviews. In order to conduct clinical screening interviews;  the social robot needs the following essential features: having a verbal conversational interface;  adapting to different types of clinical screening interviews;  scoring and evaluating answers;  having nondirective listening responses;  and enabling directive listening responses. The proposed general clinical screening interview management (GCSIM) model demonstrates these capabilities on the social robot. The robot can give structured clinical screening interviews with different question–answer sheets. This will help advance assistive technologies for use by geriatric physicians;  nurses;  and social service professionals to keep older adults healthy;  safe;  and independent at home. Robots will become more and more essential in working alongside geriatric practitioners to help monitor older adults at home and to provide early detection and warning of cognitive/mental health problems;  falls’ risk;  and so on. This early detection property can improve quality-of-care and help older adults remain living at home.
