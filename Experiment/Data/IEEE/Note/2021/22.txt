For lower limb exoskeletons;  it is a vital problem to plan the gait for sloped terrains. Considering different gradients among slopes;  fixed predefined gait planning cannot cover all cases; thus;  a slope gradient adaptive gait planning approach is necessary. The slope gradient estimator proposed in this article provides a possible slope gradient estimation method for exoskeletons or humanoid bipedal robots; it is easy to estimate the slope gradient only based on the local sensor data of the robot. The proposed dynamic gait generator provides lower limb exoskeletons and humanoid bipedal robots a possible adaptive gait planning framework and some flexibility for different slopes. The proposed approach may inspire more extended gait planning strategies for other terrains;  such as stairs.
