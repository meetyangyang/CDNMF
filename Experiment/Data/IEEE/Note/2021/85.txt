/i>\nâ€”As a typical multicellular model organism;  the zebrafish has been increasingly used in biological research. For studying drug toxicity and disease models;  exogenous substances need to be injected into zebrafish larvae. However;  for both manual and automated injection;  a fatal problem is that the camera on the microscope only provides 2-D positional information. It is laborious to align the pipette tip with the injection site along the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$z$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-axis. Moreover;  due to the characteristic of stereomicroscopes;  the impact of refraction at the water surface cannot be ignored. In order to address these issues;  in this article;  we present an adaptive calibration method and an edge detection algorithm for zebrafish larva heart injection to avoid contact failure in practical implementations.
