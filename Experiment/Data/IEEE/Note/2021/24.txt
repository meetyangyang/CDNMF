This article was motivated by the problem that how to reduce the metabolic cost most appropriately of walking by hip assistance of soft exoskeleton. In this article;  we conduct a comparison of three hip assistance modes to discuss the balance of system weight and assistance efficiency. We then propose a PD iterative learning controller based on the feedforward model to track the desired assistive force accurately. Preliminary experiments suggest that the hip extension assistance (HEA) is more suitable than hip flexion assistance (HFA) for hip assistance during single motion assistance. Multiple motion assistance is more beneficial for metabolic cost reduction when the weight of the soft exoskeleton is the same. The experimental tests show that the proposed soft exoskeleton and the control algorithm are effective for walking assistance during the loaded condition. However;  the performance of the hip assistance device is tested based on the treadmill walking only. In future research;  we will conduct a performance evaluation of the soft exoskeleton on a complex road environment.
