Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic material is used for large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) to fabricate parts in large size. This technology is new compared with other additive manufacturing technologies;  and several key problems are to be addressed before it is widely applied in industry. One issue is product quality;  which depends largely on print surface temperature. Quality problems caused by improper print surface temperature include cracking;  warping;  and deformation. Another problem is the operation inefficiency;  which results in a high cost. Currently;  it takes hours to print a single part. This article provides a framework to improve both quality and efficiency of LSAM by employing the real-time data captured from the infrared thermal camera. Specifically;  a regression model is formulated to describe the surface temperature with high accuracy. Then;  a layer time control method is proposed to schedule printing operations in real time to guarantee high printing efficiency and quality.
