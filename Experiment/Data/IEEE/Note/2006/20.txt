Nanometer scale actuators and sensors that can provide motion and measurement with nanometer-order resolution will enable new industrial applications in which only a few atoms or molecules are measured;  transported;  or processed. Linear servomotors will play a significant role in such applications because they provide precision prismatic motion directly without requiring a conversion from rotary to linear motion. Nano linear servomotors are experimentally and theoretically investigated in this paper. The devices take advantage of the ultra-low interlayer friction of a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT). Position sensing feedback is achieved by monitoring field emission;  which depends on interelectrode distance;  or by measuring resistance change between an MWNT and a gold substrate during sliding movement. Whereas this paper targets long-term nanotechnology contributions;  some intermediate results are ready for applications in the near future. The interlayer sliding motion demonstrated would enable the building of devices;  such as Gigahertz oscillators and attolitter nanosyringes;  and the sensors used for position feedback could find applications independently in a macro or microscale machine for detecting proximity;  touch;  displacement;  or orientation.
