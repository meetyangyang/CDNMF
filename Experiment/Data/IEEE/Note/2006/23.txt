This paper is motivated by the problem of designing a nanomanipulator for two-dimensional (2-D) assembly of nanoscale objects via nanomanipulation. A novel planar parallel mechanism incorporating compliant mechanisms is designed for such a purpose. Since the application of the manipulator depends significantly on the kinematic mathematical models;  the designed compliant parallel micromanipulator (CPM) is analyzed by the established pseudorigid-body (PRB) model. The architectural optimization leads to a CPM satisfying the workspace and resolution requirements of this work. Moreover;  finite-element analysis is performed to verify the accuracy of the developed PRB model;  and simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the PRB model in designing and analyzing the CPM. Since the designed CPM is composed solely of flexural elements which are known to be competent in high precise applications;  it is reasonable to expect that the CPM could find its way into 2-D manipulation of nanoscale components.
