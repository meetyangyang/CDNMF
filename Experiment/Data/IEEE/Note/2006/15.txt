This paper discusses the latest technology developments and open automation challenges in the field of adherent cell culturing. Adherent cells are cells that need a surface to attach in order to grow. Most of the human cells are adherent cells. With the legislation push supported by the cost reductions;  researchers are avoiding testing of various new compounds (e.g.;  drug candidates;  environmental toxins) on animals. Instead;  human cells are grown outside of the body (i.e.;  in vitro) for testing purposes. Growing cells in vitro is a challenge. The cells need to be maintained at a correct temperature;  pH;  oxygen;  and humidity levels;  and they need to be fed with a proper mixture of nutrients and growth factors. In other words;  the cell cultivation system;  which keeps the cells alive;  must mimic the human body conditions as close as possible. Instruments have been developed to perform the needed functions;  and a few robot-based automation systems are available to transfer the cells from an instrument to another with high throughput. Cells traditionally cultured are immortalized cell lines of cancer origin and of one cell type. These are easier to cultivate but are not as good models of human tissues as researchers would wish. Therefore;  biologists are developing new models which contain many types of cells taken directly from a patient. These various kinds of primary cell cultures are more demanding to cultivate and need sophisticated;  preferably integrated instruments and control algorithms to ensure homogenous stable environment for all of the cells. This paper provides an insight in the applications and current research trends of adherent cell cultivation. It also discusses the various subsystems needed and the automation engineering challenges posed by the new tissue models being developed by the biologists.
