Biological molecular components;  such as myosin and actin in skeletal muscle;  organize to perform complex mechanical tasks. These components execute nanometer-scale interactions;  but produce macroscopic effects. Inspired by this concept;  we are developing a new class of mechanical nanodevices that employ a group of artificial molecular machines called bistable rotaxanes. In this paper;  a series of experiments has been conducted to study the molecular properties of bistable rotaxanes in thin films and on solid-state nanodevices. Our results have shed light on the optimization of future molecular machine-based systems particularly with respect to their implementation and manufacture.
