Modern computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools are limited in functions because their controllers rely on G-codes for communications. G-code is considered a \dumb\ language as it only documents instructional and procedural data;  leaving most of the design information behind. G-code programs are also hardware dependent;  denying modern CNC machine tools desired interoperability and portability. In recent years;  two new standards emerged;  STEP-NC and function blocks. They may hold the key to empowering CNC machine tools with richer information which;  in turn;  gives CNC machine tools the ability to \think\ intelligently and to be interoperable. This paper introduces these two standards;  the technologies that have been developed based on the standards and some prototype systems using the standards and technologies. The intention is not to highlight any achieved research outcome. Instead;  the focus is on informing the research and practical world about these new standards;  analyzing them from the viewpoint of supporting interoperable CNC machine tools;  and offering some futuristic views about these standards and technologies. While these standards are still in their infancy;  research activities and prototype systems are already coming thick and fast. There seems to be a \healthy\ mixture of participants working in the field. They range from the manufacturers of all systems related to the data interface (i.e.;  CAM systems;  controls;  and machine tools);  to the users and academic institutions.
