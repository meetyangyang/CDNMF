The power supply remains a problematic area in the advancement of micro and nanoscale electromechanical systems. Flagellar motors;  when tethered in microfluidic devices;  provide a unique biological means to supply either mechanical or electrical power to these systems with high-power conversion efficiency. A major advantage of flagellar motor-powered systems is the absence of sophisticated control electronics since the motors are biologically self-sustained;  so long as a supply of nutrients is provided to the tethered motors. Additionally;  flagellar motors are relatively cost effective; they can be harvested fairly easily from cell growth using established biological protocols. However;  integrating flagellar motors with artificial devices is extremely challenging. One of the major obstacles is maintaining the motility of the tethered motors in a microfabricated environment. To overcome this;  research work has been focused on optimizing the chemo-mechanical behavior of the motors through genetic engineering and the development of an effective integration scheme for selective motor tethering at designated locations in a microfluidic device.
