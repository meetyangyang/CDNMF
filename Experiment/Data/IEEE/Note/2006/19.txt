This paper was motivated by the problem of manipulate carbon naotube (CNT) across gold microelectrodes effectively and precisely. The purposed system potentially applies to other nano-sized particles that are neutral and with high polarizability. Existing methods of CNT assembly include guided CNT growth;  external forces;  polar molecular patterning;  and atomic force microscopy (AFM) manipulation;  which is time-consuming and unrealistic when considering batch production of CNT-based sensors. This paper reported a novel method to build CNT-based sensors across the microelectrodes by using our automated microspotting system. This system is integrated with a dielectrophoretic and microspotting technique. We first explained the dielectrophorectic effect on CNT-this method is very effective to manipulate CNT. Then;  the microspotting technique was developed to spot a micron-sized CNT dilution droplet on the desired positions of a microchip substrate. Finally;  dielectropheretic manipulation can be used to position CNT bundles across the microelectrodes. In this paper;  we experimentally showed the difficulties to spot a micron-sized droplet;  and the problems can be overcome by sharpening the spotting probe chemically and using the special spotting method. We then show the yield of CNT-based sensors fabricated by using this system is very promising. We also reported that the CNT-based sensors have low power consumption;  and CNT can be used as the sensing element of the thermal sensor. The experimental results indicated this approach is feasible to develop batch manufacturing of nano devices.
