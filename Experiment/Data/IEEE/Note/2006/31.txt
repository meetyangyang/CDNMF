Disassembly is rapidly growing in importance as manufacturers face increasing pressure to deal with obsolete products in an environmentally responsible and economically sound manner. This process can be performed at a single workstation or on a disassembly line (DL) that is organized as a sequence of workstations;  each with one or more machines/operators to handle a certain type of disassembly task. Compared to a single workstation;  DL provides higher productivity and greater potential for disassembly automation. However;  it still faces serious scheduling and inventory problems because of a high degree of uncertainty in discarded products and disparity between demands for certain parts and their yield from disassembly. To address this challenge;  this paper proposes a two-level systematic approach;  aiming to maximize system throughput and system revenue by dynamically configuring the disassembly system into many DLs;  while considering line balance;  different process flows;  and meeting different order due dates. The research results can help engineers build better disassembly systems.
