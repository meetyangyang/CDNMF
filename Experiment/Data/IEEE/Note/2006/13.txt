This research was motivated by the need to develop a dynamics model for analyzing the inkjet technology-based oligo deoxyribonucleic-acid (DNA) microarray spotting process. Modeling techniques for micro/nanoscale dynamics have not been well established in the open literature. This case study shows how this can be done for DNA spotting dynamics. Contact dynamics;  electrostatic forces;  viscous forces;  and van der Waals forces have all been considered in this study. The method may be extended to model and analyze the dynamics of other biological particle spotting processes as well.
