Cycle-based signal refers to an analog or digital signal that is obtained through automatic sensing during each operation cycle of a manufacturing process. The cycle-based signal is very common in various manufacturing processes (e.g.;  forming force in stamping processes;  the holding force;  and the current signals in spot welding processes;  the insertion force in the engine assembly process). In general;  cycle-based signals contain rich process information. In this paper;  cycle-based signal monitoring will be accomplished by monitoring the wavelet transformation of the signal;  instead of monitoring the raw observations themselves. Further;  a decision-making technique is developed using the SPC monitoring system to locate where the mean shift occurred and to estimate magnitudes of mean shifts. Thus;  this paper presents a generic framework for the enhanced statistical process control technique of cycle-based signals.
