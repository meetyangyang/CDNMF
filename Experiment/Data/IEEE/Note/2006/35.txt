This paper addresses a problem which arises in applications where many sensors are used to estimate the position of a target. For most sensing models, the estimates get better as the number of sensors increases. On the other hand, energy and communication constraints may render it impossible to use the measurements from all sensors. In this case, we face the sensor selection problem: how to select a “good” subset of sensors so as to obtain “good” estimates. We show that under a fairly restricted sensing model, a constant number of sensors are always competitive with respect to all sensors and present an algorithm for selecting such sensors. In obtaining this result, we assume that the sensor locations are known. In future research, we will investigate methods that are robust with respect to errors in sensor localization/calibration..
