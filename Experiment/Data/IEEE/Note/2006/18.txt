Atomic force microscope (AFM)-based nanoassembly will lead to potential breakthroughs in manufacturing new revolutionary industrial products because many potential nanostructures and nanodevices are asymmetric;  which cannot be manufactured using self-assembly only. In order to increase the efficiency and accuracy of AFM-based nanoassembly;  automated computer-aided-design (CAD)-guided nanoassembly is desirable to manufacture nanostructures and nanodevices. Based on the CAD model;  the environment model and the model of the nanoobjects;  collision-free paths are generated to control the AFM tip to manipulate nanoobjects. A local scanning method is developed to obtain the actual position of each nanoobject to compensate for the random drift. Since the building materials of nanostructures and nanodevices may include nanoparticles;  nanorods;  nanowires;  nanotubes;  etc.;  automated path planning algorithms are developed for both nanoparticles and nanorods. The experimental results show that the developed general framework can be used to manufacture nanostructures more efficiently.
