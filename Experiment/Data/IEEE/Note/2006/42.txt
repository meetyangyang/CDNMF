One of the main challenges in the analysis and design of the resource allocation taking place in modern technological systems is the verification of certain properties of the system behavior such asliveness and deadlock freedom. The last decade has seen the developmentof a number of computational tests that can evaluate the aforementionedproperties for a large class of resource allocation systems. The tests thatare most promising essentially verify the target properties by establishingthe absence of some undesirable structure from the states that are reachable during system operation. As a result, the effective execution of thesetests necessitates the effective representation of the underlying reachabilityspace. Yet, in the past, the development of a concise and computationallymanageable representation of the system reachability space has been considered to be a challenging proposition and a factor that compromises theresolution power of the aforementioned tests. The work presented in thispaper establishes that for a very large class of the considered resource allocation systems, the underlying reachability space admits a precise and computationally efficient characterization, which subsequently leads to morepowerful verification tools of the target behavioral properties..
