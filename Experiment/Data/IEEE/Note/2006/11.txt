Real-time polymerase chain reaction is a thermally driven in-vitro replication of specific segments of DNA;  with simultaneous monitoring or reaction product by means of fluorescence detection. This process is important in biochemical analysis for the detection and/or estimation of gene concentration in DNA samples. By increasing the concentration of an initially undetectable gene and monitoring the kinetic history of the reaction;  an estimate of the initial concentration can be computed. Although there exists a plethora of commercial real-time PCR instruments;  none of these instruments are suitable for low-volume (single-digit microliters) reagents and high-throughput processing while preserving a high degree of fidelity to obtain reliable;  repeatable results;  and versatility (support for different fluorogenic probes;  different operating modes;  etc.). The A5K-automated fluid handling and sample preparation system addresses the high-throughput reaction preparation in small-volume glass capillaries. The testbed presented here is a downstream processing module for A5K. To address the challenges posed by the use of low-volume;  elongated reaction vessels;  we employ a scanning optical system with a novel inline illumination method to address up to 48 capillaries. We empirically demonstrate that the system's performance is comparable to that of existing commercial real-time PCR platforms;  and verify its repeatability and versatility. Future work will address the development of a more compact instrument that can be directly integrated with A5K.
