This paper suggests methods and control schemes for the task-based and stable telenanomanipulation in the nanoscale virtual environment (NVE). The proposed task-based and stable telenanomanipulation in the NVE can be used for an augmented human machine interface for the manipulation of nanoscale objects with the atomic force microscope (AFM). In addition;  it is beneficial for learning or performing nanoscale tasks;  such as nanolithography;  nanoindenting;  nanofabrication;  and cell manipulation. Also;  the interaction with the NVE using haptic device provides a useful tool for researchers in a variety of disciplines;  such as biology;  chemistry;  and physics. Moreover;  it may even be applied to educational purposes. In future research;  the developed stable haptic interface would be integrated with the AFM system as a slave manipulator for telenanomanipulation experiments;  such as pushing a nanoparticle with precise positioning and nanoassembly.
