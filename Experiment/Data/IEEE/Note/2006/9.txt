This paper is motivated by a problem in the fiber draw industry because of the progressive difficultly in maintaining the diameter uniformity resulting from the ever-increasing preform (or glass rod) diameter and draw speed. The larger diameter a preform is;  the longer the fiber can be drawn in the furnace from a single preform and in much less time by drawing at a higher speed. The number of setups to initiate the draw can thus be drastically lowered. The tradeoff;  however;  is that the glass takes a longer distance to cool into a fiber after leaving the furnace;  for which an insulated post-chamber is added to gradually cool the fiber to solidification in order to reduce optical losses in the final product. Existing models assuming a Dirichlet boundary condition at the furnace exit are valid only for drawing a small-diameter preform as long as the fiber solidifies inside the furnace. As larger preforms are drawn at higher speeds;  it is necessary to locate the solidification for optimizing the post-chamber design;  and to develop high-fidelity models for controlling the diameter uniformity. This paper formulates a general 2-D thermal-fluid dynamic model (which does not rely on assumptions commonly made for small preforms) to characterize the free-surface flow of the glass in both the furnace and the post-chamber. We demonstrated how a detailed description of the free surface geometry;  temperature fields;  and streamlines can be accurately computed from the 2-D model for process design;  which also provides a basis to derive a distributed quasi-1-D model explicitly solving for the essential process state variables. Both models have been experimentally validated (with a 9-cm-diameter glass preform) by comparing against the data obtained (at 25 m/s) in an industry setting. These models have been successfully applied to the design of commercial draw towers.
