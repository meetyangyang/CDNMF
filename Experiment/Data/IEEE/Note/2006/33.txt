This paper is based on a panel discussion on the topic of the emerging technology of distributed sensing and the associated challenges and opportunities. The panel;  constituted by a group of leading researchers and practitioners with expertise in operations and statistics;  convened during the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) 2003 annual meeting in Atlanta;  GA. This panel focused its discussion on the information layer technology of distributed sensing for quality and productivity improvements;  which differentiates this panel from other similar panels that were formed in a different society. The panelists provided their visions about the state-of-the-art practice;  research challenges;  and future research directions;  and also discussed potential applications based on their own experiences.
