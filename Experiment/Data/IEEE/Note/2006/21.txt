The impetus for this research was based on the desire to create a custom nanolithographic platform that could be changed and manipulated as per the users specifications and operated easily by anyone. Commercial atomic force microscopes (AFMs) that are used for nanolithography and other studies have their own specific software that enables little or no change to the workings of the system;  rendering prototyping of new research techniques to be difficult. These closed AFM instruments can be difficult to operate and are user unfriendly. This report delineates our construction of an AFM system and how we have incorporated very familiar software environments and common computer-aided-design programming language to conduct nanolithography. A brief verification of how our system performs is included; we have deposited and imaged a series of surface features in a direct write fashion on a silicon surface using a common lithographic technique that exists in the research environment.
