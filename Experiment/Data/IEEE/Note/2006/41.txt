Automated assembly processes,especially surfacemount technology manufacturing,require a high degree of precision whenplacing certain components. This motivated us to find a way of maintaininggood positional accuracy by planning smooth motions for the machinesthat perform these tasks. Since many of these machines have two or morerobots,their motions must also be coordinated. We developed an algorithmthat combines coordinated motion concepts with a minimum-jerk motionmodel that can solve these problems. The algorithm plans segmented pathsfor the robots and then sequentially plans their speeds to prevent collisionsbetween them. The planned speeds ensure position,velocity,and acceleration continuity between path segments. The smooth motions resulting fromthis method enable high-accuracy component placement. The tradeoff forthis improvement is increased cycle time compared to other speed-planningmethods..
