This paper is motivated by recent innovations in earth imaging by commercial satellites. In contrast to previous methods that required waits of up to 21 days for desired earth- satellite alignment;  new satellites have onboard pan-tilt-zoom cameras that can be remotely directed to provide near real-time response to requests for images of specific areas on the earth's surface. We consider the problem of resolving competing requests for images: Given client demand as a set of rectangles on the earth surface;  compute camera settings that optimize the tradeoff between pan;  tilt;  and zoom parameters to maximize camera revenue during each time slot. We define a new quality metric and algorithms for solving the problem for the cases of discrete and continuous zoom values. These results are a step toward multiple frame selection which will be addressed in future research. The metric and algorithms presented in this paper may also be applied to collaborative teleoperation of ground-based robot cameras for inspection and videoconferencing and for scheduling astronomic telescopes.
