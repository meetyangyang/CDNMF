This paper was motivated by the problem of analysis and performance evaluation of multioperational production systems. In these systems, machines are not dedicated but, at different time intervals, perform different operations. The overall complexity of most existing Petri net modeling and analysis approaches for production systems increases significantly with the size and the complexity of the considered system. This paper suggests a new general modular method for modeling, analysis, synthesis, and performance evaluation of random topology and complexity multioperational production systems using hybrid timed Petri nets (HTPNs). In this, the overall model construction is greatly simplified and its properties are easily obtained with respect to the features of three fundamental modules. The performance of our approach is evaluated by simulations of realistic, in terms of assumptions, manufacturing systems. The method presented provides a promising general use tool for studying multioperational production systems which, if appropriately modified, may be also applied to other types of discrete event systems..
