In this paper, we present a methodology that would allow the automation of the tedious task of exploring and selecting features to develop algorithms for automated visual inspection systems. In particular, the proposed method selects a subset of features among all of the known features. The chosen subset seeks to minimize inspection errors while keeping the algorithmic development time to a minimum. This is particularly useful for adapting pre-existing systems to inspect new components, especially when the characteristics of the new components are similar to those of components already inspected by the inspection system. We applied this methodology to a case of study of the inspection of surface-mounted devices..
