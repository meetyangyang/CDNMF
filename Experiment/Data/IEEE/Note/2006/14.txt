One trend in screening applications is to measure an increasing number of cellular parameters in parallel (high-content screening) to obtain a comprehensive view on the investigated cellular process. This motivated us to develop a platform;  which provides simultaneous acquisition of multisensor and fluorescence microscopic data. Since both techniques are well established in numerous screening applications;  we hope that this new combination stimulates the development of new assays (e.g.;  in pharmacological drug screening;  clinical diagnostics;  or environmental monitoring). Since prototypes for high-content screening are available;  we are interested in cooperation with scientists working on assay development.
