Because of the stringent production requirements (on draw speed;  tension;  and temperature);  diameter uniformity is a challenging distributed control problem in modern fiber production where progressively larger diameter preforms are drawn at higher speeds. The reduced-order model offers an effective way to observe physical variables in a multivariable distributed-parameter system;  which may not be physically measured. While developed in the context of fiber diameter control;  the modeling techniques presented in this paper are applicable to other material processing systems;  such as deposition thickness control in semiconductor wafer manufacturing.
