Nanomanipulation with scanning probe microscopes (SPMs) has potential applications in nanodevice and system prototyping;  or in small-batch production if multitip arrays are used instead of single tips. However;  SPM nanomanipulation is still being used primarily in research labs. A major obstacle to its wider use is the labor and time involved in the process. These are largely due to spatial uncertainty in the position of the tip (which is analogous to a robot's end effector) relative to the sample being manipulated. Today;  a skilled user is needed to determine where the tip is and to correct manipulation errors due to inaccurate positional estimates. The major cause of this spatial uncertainty is thermal drift between the tip and the sample. At the time scales relevant to manipulation;  the drift can reach values comparable to the size of the objects;  especially if these are below /spl sim/10 nm. The techniques discussed in this paper compensate for the drift and enable automated manipulation;  with associated savings in time and labor;  and increased complexity of the resulting structures.
