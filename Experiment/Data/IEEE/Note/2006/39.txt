Warranty failures are indicative of the performance and robustness of the product. Warranty failures;  especially those that occur early (e.g.;  within six months after sale);  can be caused by interactions between various design and process characteristics of the individual components of the product. Due to the large number of components and the interactions between them;  it is difficult to identify all of these relations during design. Furthermore;  it is difficult to replicate actual product usage in the field during the design stage. The methodology proposed in this paper integrates a product's warranty failure information with that of measurement data collected during manufacturing;  to identify relevant design and process variables related to the failures. It also identifies the warranty fault region within the original design tolerance window for the parameters. This can help in avoiding warranty failure(s) through design changes and/or tolerance revaluation. The methodology was applied in the electronics and semiconductor industries.
