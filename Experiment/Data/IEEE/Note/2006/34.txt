Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a geographical area with the ability to communicate with their neighbors within a limited radio range. Wireless sensor networks are finding increasing applicability to a range of monitoring applications in civil and military scenarios;  such as biodiversity and geographical monitoring;  smart homes;  industrial control;  surveillance;  and traffic monitoring. It is often very useful in the applications of sensor networks to know the locations of the sensors. Global positioning systems suffer from many drawbacks in this scenario;  such as high cost;  line-of-sight issues;  etc. Therefore;  there is a need to develop robust and efficient algorithms that can estimate or “localize” sensor positions in a network by using only the mutual distance measures (received signal strength;  time of arrival) that the wireless sensors receive from their neighbors. This paper describes an algorithm that solves the sensor network localization problem using advanced optimization techniques. We also study the effect of using very noisy measurements and propose robust methods to deal with high noise. Finally;  simulation results for the algorithms are presented to demonstrate their performance in terms of computational effort and accuracy.
