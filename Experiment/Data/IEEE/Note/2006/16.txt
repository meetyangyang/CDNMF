Microarraying is a powerful tool that enables the expression profiling of a vast quantity genetic/proteomic materials in parallel. Current printing technology includes photolithography;  impact pins;  inkjet;  etc. Although these designs have been successful in printing spot size down to 100 microns;  a new approach is needed to handle the order of magnitude increase in density while reducing cost. The SmartPin described in this paper is a sensor-based motion-controlled print head created for printing the next-generation microarrays. It is capable of depositing any aqueous samples (e.g.;  deoxyribonucleic acid;  protein;  etc.) and has the flexibility and cost advantage of the printing approach and yet possesses high performance and telepresence accessibility. The system utilizes an optical-fiber-based sensor probe for both sensing and sample delivery. Sensing is then integrated with computer control so that it can generate the microarray with fully controllable spot density and size. By maintaining a uniform gap distance between the pin tip and the target slide;  performance and reliability are enhanced. The current work is at the prototype development state and will need further refinement for commercialization.
