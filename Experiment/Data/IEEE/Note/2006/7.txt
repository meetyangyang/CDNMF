This paper deals with methods to convert tolerance specification as per ASME Y14.5M into a set of generalized deviation of features and vice-versa. These are intermediate relationships that are required for use in deviation-based tolerance synthesis methods. In this work;  different examples have been presented to show how different tolerance specifications (such as positional tolerance at maximum material condition (MMC);  least material condition (LMC);  etc.) applied to different features could be treated on a generalized basis for tolerancing of manufactured parts.
