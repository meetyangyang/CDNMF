 With the advancement in the automation industry;  the need to perform complex remote operations has grown. Ever-increasing computational capabilities and advancements in the networking technology have aided researchers to develop architectures to implement control from a distance. In large-scale control applications of the modern industry;  the functional agents;  such as sensors;  actuators;  and controllers are geographically distributed. For smooth working of a control application;  all of the agents have to exchange information through communication media. The results of this paper can help to design practical real-time networked control systems in modern industry.
