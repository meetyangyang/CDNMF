Techniques for the measurement scheme analysis presented in this paper enable one to formally and systematically evaluate the amount of information content a given combination of measurements carries about the process-level faults that cause quality problems in machining. Such techniques can be used to optimally select measurements that are the most informative about the machining process before a machining line is even built. Since the basis of the measurement scheme analysis methods presented in this paper is the model of the flow of machining errors referred to as the stream-of-variation (SoV) model, which can currently model only the influence of fixture and tool path parameter errors on the workpiece quality, the results presented in this paper only evaluate the amount of information about those error sources. However, as improvements to the SoV models are made in the future, the measurement scheme analysis methods and their properties demonstrated in this paper will remain valid as long as the newly obtained modes are in the linear state-space form possessed by the existing SoV models..
