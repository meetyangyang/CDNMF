Performance evaluation and scheduling are two functions required by fab managers and engineers. This paper proposed a tool which consists of a simulator and a scheduler. By connecting to the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and providing the scheduling rules;  we can see how the fab runs virtually with the simulator. General information such as throughput and average cycle time and specific information like lot activity history can be obtained. This can be used for decision making;  delivery prediction;  bottleneck seeking;  and testing of newly developed heurisitcs. The implementation cost is only on data communication between the MES and the simulator and the incorporation of rule modules. The scheduler;  which takes the simulator as the performance evaluation module;  can generate the suitable scheduling rule based on the current fab status;  preference of performance criteria;  and rule candidates. There is almost no extra cost after the simulator is connected to the MES. The scheduler can be easily made faster by common parallelization techniques.
