Certain failures in a system are repeatable;  such as routing errors in a manufacturing system. A theory for the diagnosis of such failures was presented in an earlier work of Jiang et al. The present paper uses temporal logic to specify such failures. It turns out that repeatable failures can be specified as violations of invariant properties (i.e.;  properties that must always hold). Given an invariant property that the system must always satisfy;  an algorithm is presented to refine the system model and label those states of the refined system where the property is violated. The problem of repeated diagnosis then requires determining;  within a bounded delay;  each time a \failure-state\ is visited. For this analysis;  the existing theory developed by Jiang et al. is used.
