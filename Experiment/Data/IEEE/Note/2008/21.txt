The kinematic/dynamic performance ofa parallel manipulator highly depends on its geometry, e.g., linklengths, positions of fixed actuator, shape, and size of end-effector.In designing a parallel manipulator, it is a crucial step to determine the best geometry that satisfies practical design requirements.For a general parallel manipulator, this paper provides a unifiedframework to formulate the optimal design problem by considering some key kinematic criteria, like regularity and volume ofworkspace and dexterity. The latter one is closely related to stiffness and control accuracy. Since the optimal design problem is anonlinear optimization problem without analytic expression, traditional gradient-based search algorithms have difficulty to solve theproblem. The controlled random search technique is used to searchthe global optimum. The design procedure is applicable for generalparallel manipulators. Other design criteria, such as stiffness andaccuracy, can be readily included in the design formulation.
