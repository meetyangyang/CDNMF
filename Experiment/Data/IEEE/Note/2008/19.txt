In the assembly of optical switches, heavycollision occurs during inserting fiber into U-grooves due to positioning errors and dimensional tolerances in components. It mayresult in fiber skidding out from the gripper, or the componentdamage. This paper aims to present a low-cost but effective methodto solve the problem. The idea is utilizing a special ¡°floating¡± fixture that can self-regulate high contact forces and accommodateassembly errors. This fixture is designed with flexures. In practical application, it can be built either as a standalone componentor as an embedded mechanism built-in on the chip. Preliminaryphysical experiments show by adopting such a fixture, fibers canbe inserted into U-grooves without any skidding and damage evenif using normal pick-and-place systems.
