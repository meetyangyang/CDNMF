Surface defects have been a long-term troublingissue in hot rolling processes. In this paper, functional data analysis and rigorous statistical testing are integrated to identify the process variables thatsignificantly influence the surface quality of the finished products. The results can provide guidelines for root cause identification and surface qualityimprovement in hot rolling processes.
