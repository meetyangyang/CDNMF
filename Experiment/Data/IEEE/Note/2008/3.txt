The sound recognition system comprises ofsignal enhancement module and sound classifier module. To receive betteracoustic signals in a room, a multimicrophone setting is preferred. Anacoustic activity detection algorithm is essential for detecting a salientsound waveform. The detected salient sound waveform is fed into the soundrecognition system. In the signal enhancement module, an environmentalnoise segment is the prior information that is required to calculate theestimatorâ€™s gain. In the sound classifier module, the input sound waveformis segmented into separate frames to extract the frame-based acousticfeatures.
