This paper exploits a approach to controlthe operation of a SC. This control methodology minimizes the worstcase effects of the external demand fluctuations on the performance of thesystem. The minimization over the worst case may deteriorate the averageperformance of the SC. For this reason, if it is known, e.g., from past data,that the demand fluctuations have major frequency components on a givenfrequency band interval, the strategy can be applied with a filteringprocedure improving also the average performance in terms of inventorybehavior, while assuring no bullwhip at all frequencies. An open loop implementation of such a policy could be exploited if the SC delays are notconstant.
