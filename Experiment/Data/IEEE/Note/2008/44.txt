This paper presents a model for determining the optimal capacity of an automated guided vehicle (AGV)to be purchased by a manufacturer. This paper was motivated bywork with manufacturing industries that used AGVs in their operations. The mathematical model we present conducts the performance evaluation of a system with a given number of machines.The performance evaluation done by the model is in terms of: 1) theaverage inventory in the system; 2) the long-run average cost of operating the system; and 3) the downside risk, which is measured interms of the probability of leaving a job behind at a workstationby the AGV when it departs. The model can be used to determinethe optimal capacity of the AGV needed. It can also help the manager determine whether a trailer needs to be added to an existingAGV. Of particular interest to the managers we interacted with isthe issue of downside risk defined above.As input parameters, the model requires the knowledge of thedistribution of the interarrival time of jobs at each of the workstations. It also needs the mean time taken to travel from one workstation to the next. The model can be easily computerized.The model we develop is for pick-up AGVs, which primarilypick up jobs and drop them off at a central location in the workplace. With some additional work, our models could be extendedto dropoff AGVs. They could also be used for performance evaluation of people movers in amusement parks.
