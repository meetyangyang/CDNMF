This paper describes the control technique thatgoverns the motion of an automatic gantry crane. The crane is developedto assemble modular building elements automatically to erect multistorybuildings. The modules are fitted with adequate conical connectors to ensure the stable assembly and absorb positioning tolerances of the crane.The automatic assembly system was developed using a commercial fullsize crane, which was modified by adding adequate sensors and actuators.The crane, which maintained its original cables, was converted to a roboticsystem, and is controlled via a computer. The implemented algorithms solvetwo main problems of module assembly: 1) precision positioning of largeand heavy modules, and 2) anti-swinging transportation of modules.
