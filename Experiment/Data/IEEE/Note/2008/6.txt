This paper illustrates the application of adiscrete-event modeling and control framework based on a matrixnotation to an automated warehouse. The material handling equipment must continuously transfer stock-keeping units between various buffers using a network of interconnected rail guided vehicles.Since transfer requests are issued at random times, the role of thecontrol system is extremely challenging, as it must handle low leveltasks (synchronizing hardware, avoiding conflicts) and high levelones (allocating the rail guided vehicles efficiently to avoid congestions and long service times). Giving a complete mathematicalcharacterization of such a system is challenging, due to its inherently turbulent and discrete-event nature. The proposed originalapproach allows one to attack the problem from a modular, divide-and-conquer perspective. In fact, the complete model of thesystem is achieved by a sequence of simple modeling steps, startingfrom the description of the atomic components of the system, andprogressively specifying constraints, objectives and control rulesto obtain a complete characterization of the entire system within aunified formalism based on binary matrices. Since the final modelintegrates supervisory and operational functions, it permits to perform the allocation of rail guided vehicles more effectively, using information that is generally unavailable to the dispatching modules.Examples and numerical results based on the equipment actuallyoperating in the warehouse are also provided to illustrate the potential of the approach.
