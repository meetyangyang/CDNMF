Combining the proposed mathematical model andthe TS heuristic with man-machine interactive method, a practical colorcoating production scheduling system for coils in inventory has been developed and implemented in Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, Ltd.Since many scheduling problems in the steel industry such as the hot rollingproduction scheduling problem share many similarities with the CCPSCI,the mathematical model and the TS heuristic proposed in this paper maybe extended to be applied in such problem
