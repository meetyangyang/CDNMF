This paper studies group elevator scheduling with destination entry and future traffic information fornormal operations, as well as for coordinated emergency evacuation. By exploiting the separable problem structure, a two-levelformulation is established capable of modeling advance information. An approach is then developed by incorporating severalinnovative ideas into a decomposition and coordination framework, aiming to achieve near-optimal performance. The approachhas also been extended for cases with little or no future trafficinformation and coordinated emergency evacuation. Numericaltesting results are encouraging and further improvement is neededto reduce CPU time for online implementation.
