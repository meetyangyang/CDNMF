The work in this paper was motivated bythe need to conduct an objective evaluation between methods forimplementing logic control algorithms, an assessment often omittedby practitioners owing to project time and cost constraints. The results outlined in this paper show a clear impact on productivity andare of strong relevance to industrial practitioners, demonstratingthe importance of selecting an appropriate software design methodology to suit the needs of a manufacturing process. The principalresults, derived from experimental work conducted on simplifiedequipment are thought to apply equally to large-scale industrialcontrol applications and could be validated if trained programmerswere willing to commit time to participate in exercises taking up tohalf a day each. Although this paper provides information aboutthe implications of a particular tool in use, a practitioner may wishto supplement this information by considering initial configurationtime. Further work to evaluate the impact of prior experience onthe choice of methodology is planned.
