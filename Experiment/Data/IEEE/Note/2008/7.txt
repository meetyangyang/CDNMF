In many microelectronics and otherindustrial applications, the cost of experimentation tends to beprohibitively high. Consequently, only a limited or sparse set ofdata is available for modeling and optimization of the process.Under such circumstances, the present approach based on ANFISwith SC was found to perform better than the alternative NN orneuro-fuzzy modeling methods for capturing the complex relationships that connect the machine and material parameters in theprocess performance variables, such as the MRR and WIWNUin the CMP process. These are considered as critical factors forimproving wafer yield.
