Many automated systems such as clustertools for semiconductor manufacturing repeat predeterminedcyclic work cycles. However, they may have strict time windowconstraints between a pair of events and also their activity timesare subject to random variation. However, the random variationcan be confined within a finite range with some confidence level.Our proposed method can verify whether such systems can satisfythe time constraints. By using our proposed method, engineerscan quickly examine validity of their engineering decisions suchas tool configuration and process time choices.
