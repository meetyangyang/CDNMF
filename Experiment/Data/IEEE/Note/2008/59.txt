In many applications, sensing andcommunication constraints may render using all available sensors infeasible. In such scenarios, selecting a small number ofsensors-whose collaborative performance in estimating thestate of a target is comparable to the best possible achievableerror-becomes important. This paper focuses on sensors whosemeasurements can be specified as an intersection of halfspaces(e.g., cameras, whose measurements correspond to cones). It isproven that a ¡°small¡± set of good sensors can be selected from anarbitrary set of measurements in any dimension . Of practicalimportance are the two cases: = 2 (where four sensors sufficefor a good estimate) and = 3 (eight sensors are enough).
