In some practical dextrous manipulationtasks, such as changing a bulb or using a screw driver, the robotichand has to use a finger gait to change its grasp status sequentiallyin order to perform the manipulation without dissatisfying anygrasping constraints. A finger gait not only causes the global discontinuity of a manipulation, but also maintains its local continuityunder certain grasp status. For this reason, most currently usedmodeling methods are inadequate for representing manipulationswith finger gaits. This paper presents a new modeling frameworkthat formulates the kinematics model of a manipulation with fingergait as a hybrid automaton. This automaton model not only describes how a robotic hand manipulates the object, but also showshow it makes switches between different grasp modes to satisfyall manipulation requirements. Although the scope of this paper islimited to provide a well formulated model of finger gaits, in futureresearch, our results can help to apply hybrid system techniquesto answer challenging questions in robotic manipulation. For example, is a finger gait feasible to complete the manipulation task?Or how can we find an optimal gaiting strategy?
