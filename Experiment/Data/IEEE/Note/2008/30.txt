Modeling and scheduling of cluster toolsare critical to improving the productivity and to enhancing the design of wafer processing flows and equipment for semiconductormanufacturing. This paper presents a decomposition method tocalculate the maximum throughput and to analyze the robot actionschedule for a cluster tool that contains multiple transfer robots.The proposed algorithms utilize and extend the existing results forthe single-cluster tool that only has one transfer robot. Buffer modules between two interconnected clusters are treated as either fictitious cassette modules or fictitious process modules. Therefore,we can decompose the interconnected multicluster tool into multiple single-cluster tools. The outcome of this research work provides not only answers to possible maximum throughput for a givencluster tool system but also robot schedules that address how to reach such a maximum throughput. The scheduler can be implemented and run efficiently on the cluster tool computer of a generalconfiguration cluster tool. Comparing with rule-based and simulation-based scheduling methods, the benefits of the proposed analytical approach include better throughput estimation, faster what-ifanalysis, and optimal scheduling solutions with varying processingtimes and cluster tool configurations. We have successfully testedthe methodology in this paper on dozens of cluster tools at IntelCorporation.
