The single-machine scheduling problemswith nonregular objective functions are usually harder to solve incomparison to the problems having regular objectives. Most effective algorithms for regular objective problems take advantage ofthe objective¡¯s special feature, which makes it difficult to be applieduniversally. Sometimes, however, this difficulty can be resolved bychanging conventional concepts in the algorithm. This paper addresses a typical nonregular scheduling problem and adopts a technique which has been successfully applied to the regular ones. Weextend the traditional concept of ¡°dominance¡± from one point topiecewise linear so that the technique can be applied to problemswith a piecewise linear objective function. Future research can further extend the ¡°linear dominance¡± to ¡°quadratic dominance¡± sothat this technique can be applied to the single-machine earlinesstardiness problem with a quadratic objective function as well.
