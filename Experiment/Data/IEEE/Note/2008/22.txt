This research is motivated by the problemof determining a module-based platform during product family design. The growing number of electronic markets in product development has significantly increased information related to designand the complexity of its transactions, making it difficult to controlthe electronic markets with human resources. Agent-based technologies provide a natural approach to achieve information integration in a distributed environment. This paper proposes a DMASbased on negotiation mechanisms to support product family design in an electronic market environment. This paper illustrateshow to use a market-based negotiation mechanism to determine anew platform using a case study. Future research efforts will befocused on improving the DMAS and extending its application toweb-based product family design
