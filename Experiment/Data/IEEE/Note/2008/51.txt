This paper was motivated by the problem of autonomously excavating a pile of fragmented rock using a load-haul-dump(LHD) machine, as is common in underground hard-rock mining. In thiscase, automation serves to remove human operators from hazardous environments underground, as well as to increase productivity by improvingutilization and reducing wear on the excavator. In this paper, we take a firststep toward the development of a system for autonomous excavation by performing experiments using a ten-tonne capacity machine to excavate fragmented rock taken from an underground mine in Canada. By measuringthe status of various vehicle parameters during the excavation process, wereveal a useful characterization of this process based on hydraulic cylinderpressures.
