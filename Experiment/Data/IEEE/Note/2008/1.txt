This system aims for detecting the location of multiple inhabitants in the home environment. We adopt the sensory floor as our tracking sensor;  which consists of many blocks;  each with a load cell to collect the human body weight. These blocks are covered with conventional wooden flooring to provide a flat surface on which inhabitants can walk freely. After collecting data;  we apply mathematical techniques to analyze them;  thus determining inhabitants' locations and tracking their movements. The limitation is that the system cannot differentiate different persons if they have close weight readings;  which is the natural limitation of the load cell.
