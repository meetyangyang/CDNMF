This paper was motivated by the problem of automated aircraft rivet inspection. Currently, a new nondestructive inspectiontechnology has been developed for deep layer crack detection around therivet area on an aircraft body. However, the efficiency and accuracy of theinspection system can not achieve the maximum if the inspection is manually conducted by human operators. Therefore, there is a need for automated rivet inspection. This paper develops a mobile sensor that integratesthe sensor and a micromobile robot. The control, localization and pathplanning problems are solved so that the micro mobile robot can navigateon the airplane body surface to carry out rivet inspection without humaninvolvement. This mobile robot based inspection system can be extended todifferent engineered structure inspection applications by integrating different sensors. The use of vision-assisted localization method requires thatthe position information of the inspected subject, such as rivets, should beknown from a source such as a CAD model. Also, the surface of the structure to be inspected should be reasonably smooth to enable the robot tostick to it. Our future work will integrate multiple mobile sensors to speedup the inspection process.
