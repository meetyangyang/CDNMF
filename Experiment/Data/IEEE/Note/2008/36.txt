Fixtures are used to locate and hold workpieces with locators and clamps, respectively, so that the desiredpositions and orientations of the workpieces can be maintainedduring machining or manufacturing processes. When an externalwrench such as cutting forces/torques and clamping forces, is exerted on a workpiece during machining, the workpiece will displace its desired position and orientation because of local elasticdeformations at contacts. In order to obtain the higher localizationaccuracy for the workpiece, we need to plan the clamping forces including their magnitudes and positions. This paper defines theminimum norm of the elastic deformations at contacts as the objective function, and describes a general method for determiningthe optimal clamping forces. A numerical example is given to verifythe proposed planning method of clamping forces
