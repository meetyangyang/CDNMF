The paper describes the design and implementation of an automated system for the planning and optimization of lumber production in sawmills. Cross-sectional images ofhardwood logs are acquired using Computed Tomography (CT).These images are analyzed for the presence and locations of internal log defects using Machine Vision algorithms. Three-dimensional computer models of the hardwood logs and their internaldefects are created. Computer algorithms are designed to simulate various sawing operations on the 3-D log models, automatically grade the resulting virtual lumber products and determinethe sawing strategy that maximizes the lumber value yield beforethe log is physically sawn. The system is intended as a decision aidfor lumber production planning and an interactive training tool fornovice sawyers and machinists in the lumber industry.
