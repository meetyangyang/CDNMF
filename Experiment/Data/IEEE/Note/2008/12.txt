Online process control through nondestructive inspection of workpieces is a value added operationwhich ensures product quality during manufacturing processes.This is especially important in layer manufacturing where workpieces are built layer by layer, and any significant defect withinintermediate layers will result in defective products. The methodology developed here provides the ground work for a technologywhich can be efficiently applied for industrial application bothin terms of its feasibility (i.e., its computational feasibility forreal-time applications) and costs
