This paper proposes a dynamic reconfiguration framework that can revise the operations of systems whose control requirements change over time. The proposed framework can be applied to systems that satisfy the following two assumptions. First;  the behavior of the system under study is described in terms of a set of discrete states and events. Events will cause the system to transition between states. Second;  the control requirements must be expressed by linear equalities and inequalities on the system states. Under these circumstances;  the proposed framework can identify an optimal transition to a new control policy that satisfies the new control requirements. Moreover;  the system under consideration will continue operating while this transition is taking place. One application of this method is in modifying hospital control strategies when a hospital experiences unexpected events. In this case;  the hospital operations-such as patient handling;  resource assignment;  and procedure scheduling-can be represented by discrete state models (e.g.;  Petri nets). Constraints on these operations can be modeled by linear inequalities on hospital and patient state. Upon a change in the constraints;  the proposed reconfiguration method revises the hospital control strategies. For example;  a shift in the hospital service demands (e.g.;  an increase in the flow of patients to the hospital due to a mass casualty situation) can be translated to changes in the constraints. In this case;  the hospital operations must be revised to accommodate the new constraints without disrupting the operation of the hospital. The reconfiguration method of this paper provides a framework for modeling the reconfiguration steps and for calculating the least cost reconfiguration solution.
