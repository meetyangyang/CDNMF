The distribution network designproblem considered in this paper was motivated by industrialapplications encountered in an EU-funded project GROWTHONE. These applications, from automotive and textile industries,showed that supply chain design decisions are strongly linkedto operational decisions and cannot be made without takinginto account operational performances such as inventory costsand customer service levels. A simulation-based multiobjectiveoptimization approach was proposed in ONE for supply chaindesign. The main drawback of the ONE approach is the excessive computational time. The goal of this paper is to propose ananalytical distribution network design model that captures keyoperational performances yet remains tractable. The analyticalmodel integrates the following decisions that are traditionallytreated separately at different levels: the number and locationsof DCs, the assignment of retailers to DCs, and the inventorylevel to keep at each DC. A Lagrangian relaxation-basedapproach is proposed to determine in a few minutes a nearoptimal distribution network.
