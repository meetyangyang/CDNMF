The Hybrid Nested Partitions and Mathematical Programming Approach provided in this paper is easy toimplement and potentially applicable to many types of problems.For a given type of problem, the hybrid approach is very suitablefor situations where many different kinds of real constraints areconsidered. Also, practitioners can design customized proceduresto evaluate partial solutions and incorporate domain knowledgeand local search into the nested partition framework to further improve the performance of the algorithm.
