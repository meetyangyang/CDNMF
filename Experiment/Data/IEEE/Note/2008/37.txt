The proposed new control mechanismwith a novel distinguished node model provides a set of uniqueadvantages and opportunities to real applications of small-agentnetworks. Two typical application categories are urban trafficnetworks and data networks. This paper addresses our application to urban traffic networks. Through investigation on a realtraffic control example, we successfully demonstrate the uniqueadvantage of the proposed new control mechanism, in which theconcept of distinguished node model plays a major role
