Hierarchical decision making problemsarise naturally in many fields including electronic commerce,supply chain management, distributed computing, transportation networks, manufacturing systems, and multiagent systems.These problems involve interacting decision-making agents witha predefined sequence according to which decisions are taken. Ifthe agents are rational and intelligent, these problems induce aStackelberg game and for this reason, these problems could becalled Stackelberg problems. In this paper, we look at a prominentspecial class of these problems called SLRF problems. Thereare many emerging examples of SLRF problems: auctions withreserve prices, Internet routing, supply chain formation, resourceallocation in computational grids, routing in transportationnetworks, scheduling in manufacturing systems, etc. The maincontribution of this paper is to extend classical mechanism designto the class of SLRF problems. Classical mechanism design usesthe framework of Bayesian games whereas mechanism designapplied to SLRF problems has to deal with the more generalBayesian Stackelberg games. This motivates the theoretical contribution of this paper, which is to extend mechanism design to the setting of SLRF problems. This paper also offers a significantapplication: designing incentive compatible procurement auctionswith reserve prices. Mechanism design or protocol design in thecontext of all the emerging applications mentioned above will be arich avenue for applying this theory.
