Maintaining an asset with life-limitedparts, e.g., a jet engine or an electric generator, over its lifetime maybe costly. Optimizing maintenance policies, however, is difficultbecause of complicated asset dynamics, large problem sizes, andirregular optimal policy structures. This paper addresses theproblem by a rollout optimization framework. In this framework,the ¡°One-Stage Analysis¡± method, which minimizes the expectedaverage cost over one maintenance period, is first developed andinvestigated. The policies, obtained by either the ¡°One-StageAnalysis¡± method or the existing threshold method, are used insimulation to evaluate and select good actions. Similar to thoselearning approaches, this simulation-based framework is flexiblefor variant performance criteria, e.g., total cost or average cost, andis applicable to problems without explicit mathematical models.Numerical results demonstrate that effective policies can be obtained by the rollout framework in a computationally efficient wayand they significantly outperform traditional threshold policies.
