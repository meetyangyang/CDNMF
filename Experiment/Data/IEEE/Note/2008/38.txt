The automation of railway systems (and,in general, of large-scale distributed discrete event systems) is acomplex problem that can be decomposed in several subproblems.It is necessary to be able to build a model of the plant, to simulate it,to design appropriate control logic to ensure that abnormal situations, such as collisions or deadlocks, never occur. In this paper, wepresent an approach based on a graphical model that is familiar tothe automation community: Petri nets. Our approach presents twomain advantages. First, we are able to address all these subproblems within a single formalism, thus making it worthwhile for thepractitioner the effort of investing some valuable time to learn moreabout Petri nets. Second, the mathematical approaches used to determine the solution in all these steps are based on simple matrixcomputation and standard operation research tools, that are easilyaccessible to practitioners with a background in computer and systems engineering. Another interesting problem that we also plan tosolve using Petri nets-but that is not addressed in this paper-isthat of scheduling the railway system so as to optimize its efficienc
