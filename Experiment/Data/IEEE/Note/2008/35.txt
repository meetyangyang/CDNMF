A short product design cycle is criticalfor manufacturers to succeed in the era of time-based competition. To speed up the design process, concurrent engineering hasbeen widely used where multiple design tasks are concurrently performed. As a design task can be performed with preliminary orpartial information on other tasks and the information may be updated, effective communication is required. If design and communication activities are not properly coordinated, the project maybe significantly delayed by waiting for information or by the needfor rework. This paper presents a novel formulation for designproject scheduling by appropriately modeling task dependenciesand the associated communication activities. A solution methodology based on decomposition and coordination is developed toschedule both design and communication tasks to achieve timelyproject completion. Numerical results show that the approach iseffective to handle various task dependencies and the associatedcommunication activities to provide high-quality schedules.
