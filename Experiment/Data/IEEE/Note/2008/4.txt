In the field of biology, the majority of cellular response studies have been performed on large populations ofcells, providing only the average cellular response to a stimulus. Recent advances have revealed cell-to-cell heterogeneity among previously presumed homogeneous populations and have suggested thatthis heterogeneity is an important factor for understanding manydiseases such as cancer, heart disease, and stroke. It may be necessary to monitor the response of individual cells within a population to a given stimulus. Identifying and tracking the progressionof detrimental variants that have slipped by the safety mechanismsof the body is key to developing the next generation of patient treatments. These outliers can be identified by several measurable parameters including oxygen consumption rates, which is the focushere.
