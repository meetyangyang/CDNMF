Deadlock is a constant problem in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) with shared resources, which often offsets the advantages of these systems since deadlock can cause unnecessary cost, suchas long downtime and low use of some critical and expensive resources, andmay lead to catastrophic results in highly automated FMS. Behavior permissiveness has been an important criterion in designing the liveness¨Cenforcing supervisor for an uncontrolled system. The theory of region is aneffective method to derive a maximally permissive supervisor from a plantnet model. However, it is rather inefficient. In this particular research, wedevelop a hybrid approach that combines siphon control and the theory ofregions to derive a maximally permissive liveness¨Cenforcing Petri net supervisor for a large class of FMS
