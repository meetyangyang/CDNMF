Petri nets represent a modeling formalism for discrete dynamical systems that offers a great modeling power. Among others,Petri nets have been successfully applied in the fields of manufacture, communication, logistics, and traffic. Continuous Petri nets came up to handlethe state explosion problem inherent to highly populated discrete systems.The state of a plant modeled with a continuous Petri net is given by a setof real variables. This way, the initial load of the plant has no effect on thecomplexity of the analysis techniques to be applied. Obtaining an accurateknowledge of the state of the plant is a crucial task that can determine thefeasibility and reliability of subsequent activities as control. The usual wayto catch information about the dynamical system under consideration isthrough sensors located on the physical plant. Unfortunately, in many realsituations some state variables cannot be measured through sensors due toeither their inaccessible location, the lack of such sensors or the high costinvolved in the installation of the sensors. The good news is that the valueof those a priori nonmeasurable variables can be estimated if the plant fulfils some technical conditions. Usually, state estimates can be obtained bybuilding a dynamical system called ¡°observer¡± whose output is the estimatefor the plant. The paper can be roughly divided into two parts. In the firstpart, the conditions required to compute estimates are studied. The secondpart presents a method to design observers whose state converges to thestate of the plant.
