In production systems with unreliable machines;  operation with no-buffers (i.e.;  JIT) leads to low throughput. Very large buffers lead to high throughput but undesirable quality and economics properties. So;  which level of buffering is good? This is the question addressed in this paper. The good level of buffering is addressed in terms of line efficiency;  i.e.;  the fraction of the maximum of the throughput;  which is acceptable for the system. For example;  assume that the desired line efficiency is 0.9 (i.e.;  90% of the maximum throughput is viewed as satisfactory). Under such an assumption;  this paper offers methods for calculating the smallest (i.e.;  lean) level of buffering;  which guarantees the desired throughput;  provided that uptime and downtime of the machines are distributed exponentially with arbitrary mean time to failure and mean time to repair.
