We propose a neural-network-baseddegradation model that estimates utilizes real-time sensory signalsto estimate the failure time of partially degraded components. Theproposed model has been tested and validated on rolling elementbearings by using real-time vibration signatures to estimate theirfailure times. In order to implement, one must first identify thesensory information that is correlated with the underlying degradation process. Next, a sample of components, similar to the onebeing monitored is tested. Degradation-based sensory informationare acquired and stored along with the corresponding operatingtimes of each acquisition. A group of neural networks are trainedusing supervisory training protocols. Each neural network istrained to identify the degradation pattern of one component inthe sample. This is achieved by training the network to identifythe operating time corresponding to each sensory signature thatis input to the network. Sensory signals from similar componentsoperating in the field are then input to the network model and usedto predict the failure time based on the latest degradation state ofthe component being monitored. Steps 1Â¨C4 outline the details ofthe implementation. The sensory-updating methodology is usedto continuously update the failure time predictions as subsequentreal-time signals are acquired.
