The trend of an aging population and of a nondecreasing proportion of people with disabilities could lead to a shortageof caregivers, which will become a serious problem in the near future. Toassist the elderly and people with disabilities, a smart house can be a solution for improving quality-of-life and coping with their demands. However,the increase in the number and complexity of assistive systems to enhanceavailable services in a smart house could lead to a decrease in convenience,accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, because it is very difficult to controlall the devices using a large number of corresponding human-machine interfaces. To resolve this problem, this paper introduces the concept of asteward robot that helps the user in the smart house environment to operate all the systems easily. The steward robot can reduce the user¡¯s cognitive load during operation because it commands and controls all subsystems in lieu of the user and provides proactive services based on the user¡¯sbehavioral patterns.
