This research was motivated by the apparent lack of a technique to uniquely position small section pins inan array, without a bulky control system, power limitations, or motion system restrictions. Prior approaches to positioning pins in anarray have used multiplexed or sequential control on pins of 6 mmsection or larger. This research investigates a combined controlsystem/hardware approach applied to pins of 1 mm square section,scalable to move thousands of pins uniquely. The presented novelsolutions generate a higher fidelity surface definition than previoussystems. Extending existing research on surface-smoothing interpolators that reduce the ¡°staircase¡± effect generated by discretepins would be beneficial
