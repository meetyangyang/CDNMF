Petri nets are a well-known formalism for the analysis and design of discrete event systems. Due to the state- explosion problem some kind of relaxation is frequently used. In particular;  fluidification is a classical approximation technique that it is usually employed in the analysis of manufacturing or logistic systems;  specially when heavily loaded. This work focuses on timed continuous Petri nets which are a fluidified version of discrete Petri nets with timing associated to transitions (representing stations with servers that perform activities). Furthermore;  transitions have associated control actions which can slow down the corresponding activities from an initial maximum speed;  that depends on the marking;  and possibly halt them completely. The steady-state control problem of this kind of system and some invariant-dynamical properties are addressed. </para>.
