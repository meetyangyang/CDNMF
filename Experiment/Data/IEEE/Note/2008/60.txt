Modern oil refinery requires that itsshort-term schedule be obtained in a pull mode so that it canrapidly adapt to dynamic market changes. An efficient tool isdemanded to find such a short-term schedule in a reasonable timefor practical application problems. Motivated by such needs, thisstudy defines the short-term scheduling problem in the pull modeand proposes a heuristic method to solve it. First, the problem ismodeled by a kind of Petri nets. Then, the properties of oil refinerysystems are analyzed and rules are obtained. With these rules, aheuristic algorithm is proposed. It is tested in a refinery companyand works well for practical cases. Additional work is needed tocommercialize the proposed method for wider process automationapplications.
