Rapidly changing market needs is makingdemands on flexibility and ability to shorten lead times. Standardsfor exchanging information, as well as formal methods for automatic development of programmable controller code have beenimportant research topics for many years. There are a lot of software tools available for the generation of both product- and resource information, but there is still a lack of tools for producingprocess information. Moreover, the connection between information exchange standards and such tools is absent, which makes thedevelopment of programmable controller code an isolated activity.This activity is often time consuming and performed in an ad hocmanner resulting in unnecessary production delay.The aim of this paper is to show how the international standardSTEP-AP214 (a standard for exchange of product-, process-, andresource related information) can be used for communicating andstoring process specifications. In order to achieve this, a tool whichmakes use of a formal high-level language is suggested. This toolcan be used for automatic control generation and has been developed in accordance with the process relations defined in STEPAP214. A further aim is to shown how the mentioned tool can beused to specify complex systems in a compact, yet highly readablemanner, which is a crucial incentive for industry to use formalmethods. The presented method will guarantee that expected information is delivered quickly and without errors caused by thehuman factor, something that is very important in our ambition toachieve shortened lead times. The quick information exchange alsomakes it possible to perform simulation, supervisor synthesis, andverification early in the development phase. This is a first attemptat using a formal language for creating a tool that can automatically generate specifications in accordance with the internationalSTEP-standard.
