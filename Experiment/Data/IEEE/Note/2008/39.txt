Tissue engineering aims at generation of artificial tissues and organs using patient specific cells. Cells obtainedfrom an individual are cultured and seeded onto a 3-D scaffold thatwill slowly degrade and resorb as the bone structures grow and assimilate in vivo. This paper develops a novel robotics technique tofabricate scaffolds with custom properties, which could provide optimal growth conditions. Our technique, consisting of assemblingmicroscopic building blocks, can potentially provide physicians thefreedom to design and modify the scaffold surface morphology andtopology at the micron level in order to facilitate cellular colonization and organization.
