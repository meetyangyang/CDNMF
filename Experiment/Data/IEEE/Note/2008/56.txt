For event-driven systems in which controllable events occur when commanded by a controller (such asmanufacturing systems, traffic control systems, etc.), it is meaningful to design a controller that enables at most one controllableevent at any state. In contrast, a supervisory controller that onetraditionally designs enables a certain maximal set of controllableevents. This paper introduces the notion of a directed controller, ora director, that enables at most one controllable event at any state.Using the algorithms presented in this paper one can verify the existence as well as perform the synthesis of a nonblocking directorin time polynomial in the number of system states.
