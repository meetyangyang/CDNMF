This paper was motivated by UltraLognetworks which are the next-generation military logistics planningsystems. The performance of these networks is determined by thequality of logistics plan and plan completion time. Since the networks are large-scale and their performances directly affect themilitary operations, there is a need to facilitate some simple but effective control mechanisms. We suggest a promising approach tothis novel control problem. After formulating a mathematical programming model by investigating the impacts of the parallelismon the optimal resource allocation policy, the programming modelis decentralized through an auction market. When this auctionmarket is open periodically the system can achieve desirable performance while assuring scalability. The control mechanism provided here is also applicable to the workflow applications whenthere are multiple jobs in batch. Though the workflow applicationsfocus on a single job, there will be some situations where batchprocessing is more desirable. In future research, we will addressthe topology determination problem which assigns components toavailable machines with a set of constraints
