Motivated by a practical asset maintenance problem, we introduce a new joint replacement maintenancemodel in this paper. This problem can be extended to other maintenance problems with safety-critical components and has importanteconomical benefit for companies. During the optimization of jointreplacement problems, the action space will grow exponentiallywith the system size. It makes the action selection very inefficient.This large action space problem is little addressed in the literature.We identify the SRLF rule which can reduce the action space to thelinear size of the number of components. This rule can preserve theoptimal actions in the reduced action space and make the actionselection efficient. Based on this rule, we derive some properties ofthe optimal policy. These properties can be used to improve the efficiency of optimization algorithms. The SRLF rule is just a heuristics for the action selection. In the practical application, it shouldbe combined with other optimization algorithms. This paper discusses its combination with NDP algorithm, which is usually usedto deal with the large-scale stochastic optimization problems. Thiscombined algorithm can handle the problems of large state spaceand large action space. The simulation experiments demonstrateits efficiency and scalability, but, when the practitioners use theNDP algorithm, it should be noted that the selection of basis functions (features) is quite empirical. It heavily depends on the practitioners¡¯ experiences on the studied problem.
