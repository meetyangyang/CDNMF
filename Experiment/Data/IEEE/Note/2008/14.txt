Part feeding is a crucial issue in automaticassembly and uses vibratory bowl feeders extensively in most cases.The purpose of a vibratory bowl feeder is to deliver a right quantity of parts at a right speed for automatic assembly of a hugequantity of parts. However, this is still solved on an ad hoc basisand the process can take months. It requires a right resonant frequency to achieve the correct feeding, and thus a systematic andsubstantial study of the natural frequencies of bowl feeders aremuch needed in relation to its design parameters particularly theassembly parameters. This paper is to establish a systematic dynamics model of bowl feeders characterized by system dampingand compliance, and to provide the effect of design parametersparticularly assembly parameters on the natural frequencies. Thisprovides a framework for a designer to design a vibratory bowlfeeder with a right resonant frequency that can provide a rightquantity of parts at a right speed. It further provides an operator to fine tune the device with assembly parameters to achieve the rightresonant frequency and to provide the right excitation amplitudeto achieve a desirable vibration mode.
