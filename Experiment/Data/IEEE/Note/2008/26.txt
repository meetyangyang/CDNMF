Flexible demand assignment (FDA) isan interesting variant of the classical one-dimension bin packingproblem, where customers accept a flexible size for each itemwithin a specified range rather than a fixed size. Manufacturersneed to determine the optimal size for each item for maximizingthe profit, where large sizes for items may possibly increase thecost of using bins, while large sizes could increase the revenuefor the manufacturers. Different from the published operationresearch-based approaches, we propose three effective neighborhood operators to solve the FDA problem by a simple local search.This study illustrates an example for industry practitioners onhow to design specified neighborhood operators for implementingeffective metaheuristics for more accurate and faster solutions.
