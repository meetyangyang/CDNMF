This paper was motivated by the problem of developing an intelligent evaluation system in place of skilled workers to evaluate the quality of transmission devices automatically based on acousticdata. Most of the prior works in quality evaluation of transmission devicesare based on processing vibrometer signals for system vibrations. Such vibrometers must be installed on the surface of vibrating part of transmissiondevices, which alter the physical integrity. In this paper, the acoustic data ofoperating transmission devices are recorded. We first compute the ASFTSand FVAVT, where ASFTS denotes the average of a serial of spectra calculated from time segments of an acoustic data and FVAVT denotes the feature vector of amplitude variation with time in a certain band. By using thedifferent characteristics of the ASFTS and the FVAVT, we apply the LVQand the FGA to the quality evaluation of transmission devices, respectively.Utilizing the advantages of the SOM, we classify the defective products successfully. In the industry production, the quality of each batch of productswill change according to the situation of equipments. Similarly, the qualityevaluation rule will be adjusted according to the yield and the request ofcustomers. The proposed system can evaluate the quality of transmissiondevices correctly as demanded so long as we change the nondefective anddefective samples.
