Global outsourcing is a common practicenow in manufacturing and service industries. India and China withtheir skilled and low-cost human resources are potential destinations for outsourcing. Multinational firms making efforts to exploitthese opportunities, have several alternatives before them. Theycan start a fully owned subsidiary or buy components or subassemblies from suppliers in low-cost countries or have joint ventures.Leading firms need to evaluate between the possible alternativeskeeping in mind the logistics and other delivery costs as well as thetaxes and tariffs. In this paper, we develop an optimization modelto choose between the two extreme alternatives at each stage in thesupply chain: FDI which implies establishing a fully owned subsidiary or outsourcing. Integrating tax policy while deciding between FDI versus outsourcing at the various stages of a supplychain would lead to the design of a cost competitive supply chain.In view of the importance of this strategic problem, economists andbusiness analysts have started looking at it in an analytical way. Our paper is of immense practical utility for companies to makeoptimal entry decisions at each stage in its supply chain that minimizes the total cost which includes taxes and tariffs and meets thedemand for its products or services in different countries (or regions). Tax integrated supply chain planning could save millions ofdollars for companies operating globally.
