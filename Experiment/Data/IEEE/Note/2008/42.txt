Robotic control systems include manycomponents, such as sensors, actuators, joints, and motors. Thesecomponents are required to function according to some specifications and requirements in order to operate system precisely andreliably. However, due to prolonged operations or a harsh operating environment, the properties of these devices undergo changeswith time, and the corresponding performance of the system maydegrade to an unacceptable level. At this stage, more regularfaults occur leading ultimately to a total collapse in function. Suchsystem failures can result not only in the loss of production but alsoin the loss of human lives. It is therefore necessary to provide therequired operation of the entire robotic system by: 1) the onlinefault diagnosis scheme which detects a fault as it occurs, whichidentifies the malfunction of a faulty component, and 2) the faultaccommodation scheme which compensates for the fault of thecomponent by substituting a configuration of redundant elementsso that the system continues to operate satisfactorily [1].
