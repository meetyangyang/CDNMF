Manipulation at the nanoscale by usingAFMs as sensory robots is well established in research laboratories,and has great potential as a process for prototyping nanodevicesand systems, for repairing structures built by other means, andfor small batch manufacturing by using multitip arrays. However,precise (to 1 nm, say) AFM nanomanipulation is currently verylabor intensive, primarily because of the uncertainty in the positionof the AFM tip relative to the sample being manipulated. Positionalerrors are due to thermal drift and various nonlinearities exhibitedby the piezoelectric scanners used by most AFMs. This paper describes a technique for compensating creep and hysteresis, which,after drift, are the major causes of spatial uncertainty in AFMs.The compensator introduced here has been tested experimentallyand shown to reduce creep and hysteresis effects by more than anorder of magnitude. The creep and hysteresis compensator in thispaper, together with the drift compensation scheme discussed in anearlier paper by the authors, provide means to reduce spatial uncertainties to a level that enables automatic manipulation, withouta user in the loop, and therefore promise to greatly increase thethroughput and accuracy of nanomanipulation operations.
