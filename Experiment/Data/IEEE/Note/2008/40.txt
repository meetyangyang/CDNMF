Traditional NNS manufacturing systems(e.g., forging, injection molding, and casting) require the designand manufacture of production tooling such as molds, dies, jigs,or fixtures to produce NNS components. Therefore, the production time of NNS parts is significantly affected by the need for production tooling. A new method to manufacture NNS parts directlyfrom CAD information is presented in this paper. The proposedsystem is based on the automatic decomposition of 3-D models intoa hierarchy of cubes of different sizes, which are assembled automatically using an industrial robot. There are several technicaladvantages of the proposed system over existing methods: it doesnot require the design and manufacture of production tooling; itcan build parts from any rigid material (i.e., wood, plastic, ceramic,metal alloy, etc.); the build rate is extremely quick compared to saylaminar manufacturing methods or direct CNC machining. However, the system is also significant because it demonstrates an approach to automated NNS manufacture that can be implemented using standard hardware (i.e., a pick and place robot and conveyorfeeder) and can be easily scaled to macro or microapplications.The production of several test components has proved that the proposed system is practical as described. Future work considers theautomatic postprocessing of NNS components to produce net shapeparts automatically, and the investigation of alternatives to adhesives bonding of the assembly.
