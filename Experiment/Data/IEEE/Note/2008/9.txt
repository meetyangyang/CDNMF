This paper presents a mechanism of composition for modeling the interaction of DESs. To form the composition one needs to identify for each system the events that it can control (actuator events) and the events that it can observe (sensor events). The composition ensures that a system never blocks its uncontrollable events and never reacts differently to events that are observationally indistinguishable. An event is executable in the composition if it is enabled by all participating systems and either trackable or executable in some participating system. An event is enabled by a participating system if it is either currently executable or a nonpriority event;  whereas an event is trackable by a participating system if it is observable and indistinguishable to some currently executable event. A state update on an event;  executable in the composition;  occurs by executing an indistinguishable event by each participating system in which the event is trackable;  whereas the other participating systems retain their current states. The composition is commutative and associative;  supporting incrementality. We obtain a condition under which a given system (plant) can be controlled to exhibit the desired behaviors when the proposed mechanism is employed to compose the plant and a controller. The plant and the desired behavior models may differ in their levels of abstraction. The condition can be polynomially verified and a controller can be synthesized in linear complexity.
