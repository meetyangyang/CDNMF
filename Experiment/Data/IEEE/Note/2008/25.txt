In stochastic production networks, decisions concerning when to produce and whether to accept or rejectan incoming order are often made separately or sequentially. Forexample, inventory control is often applied assuming that all demand during a stockout period is either completely backlogged orlost. This paper studies two partial backordering policies jointlywith an integral inventory control policy, and explores the benefitsof coordinated decision making.
