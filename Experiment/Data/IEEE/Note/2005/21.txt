Semantic interoperability of product information refers to automating the exchange of meaning associated with the data;  among information resources throughout the product development. This research is motivated by the problems in enabling such semantic interoperability. First;  product information is formalized into an explicit;  extensible;  and comprehensive product semantics representation language (PSRL). The PSRL is open and based on standard W3C constructs. Next;  in order to enable semantic translation;  the paper describes a procedure to semi-automatically determine mappings between exactly equivalent concepts across representations of the interacting applications. The paper demonstrates that this approach to translation is feasible;  but it has not yet been implemented commercially. Current limitations and the directions for further research are discussed. Future research addresses the determination of semantic similarities (not exact equivalences) between the interacting information resources.
