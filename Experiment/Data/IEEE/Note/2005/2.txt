Multibody contact systems are broadly involved in many engineering applications. The motivation of this is to solve for the contact forces and body motion for planning the fixture-inserting operation. However;  the results of the paper can be generally used in problems involving multibody contacts;  such as robotic manipulation;  mobile robots;  computer graphics and simulation;  etc. The paper presents a numerical method based on an extension of an explicit time-stepping scheme;  and an application of the differential inclusion process introduced by J. J. Moreau;  and compares the numerical results with an acceleration-based scheme with linear complementary techniques. We first describe the mathematical model of contact kinematics of smooth rigid bodies. Then;  we present the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for resolving the multiple simultaneous contacts within the time-stepping framework. Finally;  numerical examples are given and compared with the previous results of a different approach;  which shows that the simulation results of these two methods agree well;  and it is also generally more efficient;  as it is an explicit method. This paper focuses on the description of the proposed time-stepping and Gauss-Seidel iterations and their numerical implementation;  and several theoretical issues are yet to be resolved;  like the convergence and uniqueness of the Gauss-Seidel iteration;  and the existence and uniqueness of a positive k in solving frictional forces. However;  our limited numerical experience has indicated positive answers to these questions. We have always found a single positive root of k and a convergent solution in the Gauss-Seidel iteration for all of our examples.
