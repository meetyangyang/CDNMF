This paper presents an optimization method for finding tolerance values for different features of an assembly of manufactured parts. Determination of different types of tolerances and their exact values for critical features of any part has been an ad-hoc process; it has been mostly experience-based till recent time. In this paper;  efforts have been made to establish a strong mathematically oriented method for synthesis of tolerances. The procedure attempts to minimize cost of manufacturing while the functionality and assemblability are satisfied. It is a generalized method and could be applied for designing rigid manufacture parts. For practical usage;  this method should be integrated with three-dimensional computer-aided design packages as a tolerance synthesis module for integrated tolerance design.
