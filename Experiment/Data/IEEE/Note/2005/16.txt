It is common in practice that a machine is subject to breakdowns;  which may severely interrupt the job it is processing. In such a situation;  there may be limited information on the breakdown patterns of the machine and the processing requirements of the jobs. A great challenge faced by the decision-maker is how to utilize the information available to make a right decision. Stochastic scheduling considering stochastic machine breakdowns aims to determine the optimal policies in these situations. In this paper;  we study the problem within the preemptive-repeat breakdown framework;  to address the practical situations where a job will have to be re-started again if a machine breakdown occurs when it is being processed. Problems of such can be found in many industrial applications. Examples include refining metal in a refinery factory;  running a program on a computer;  performing a reliability test on a facility;  etc. Generally;  if a job must be continuously processed with no interruption until it is totally completed;  then the preemptive-repeat breakdown formulation should be used. Our research in this paper focuses on optimal dynamic policies;  which aim to utilize real-time information to dynamically adjust/improve a decision. We consider two types of models;  depending on whether the processing time of the job interrupted by a breakdown must be resampled or not. For the problem with resampled processing times;  we establish a general optimality equation under a unified objective measure. We further deduce the optimal dynamic policies under a number of well-known criteria. For the problem without resampled processing times;  we develop the optimal dynamic policies;  under the criteria of weighted discounted reward and weighted flowtime. Broadly speaking;  our findings can be applied in any situations where it is desirable to derive the best dynamic decisions to tackle the problem with stochastic machine breakdowns and preemptive-repeat jobs.
