-In the manufacturing of molds;  the most time-consuming process is on the final stage the polishing process. The polishing processes in the mold industry are almost conducted manually. The worker needs exceptional skill that can only be trained by experienced master. For mass production of molds;  automatic polishing of the mold is a necessary. From the long-term research effort;  we have constructed an automatic mold polishing system (AMPS). The AMPS includes a dedicated 5-axes robot to execute the polishing task; a force control mechanism to hold the tool and apply constant pressure on the mold surface; and a software system that can read the geometry of the mold surface and automatically generate the detail polishing process and the polishing path for the robot. The AMPS now can handle polishing process for planar surfaces with obstacle inside and surfaces of revolution. Research effort is now concentrated on dealing with the free-from surfaces. Besides;  reading the Initial Graphics Exchange System (IGES) format from various computer-aided design systems is another important issue for the system to be more useful. In all;  the AMPS is just begin to accumulate any further researches and developments that may sustain various requirements of polishing applications.
