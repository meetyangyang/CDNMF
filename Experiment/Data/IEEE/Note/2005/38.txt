This work is based on several consultancy work that we have done for transportation companies in Hong Kong. The multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) is one of the core optimization problems in transportation;  logistics;  and supply chain management;  which minimizes the total travel distance (the major factor of total transportation cost) among a number of given depots. However;  in real practice;  the MDVRP is not reliable because of the assumption that there have unlimited number of vehicles available in each depot. In this paper;  we propose a new useful variant of the MDVRP;  namely multi-depot vehicle routing problem with fixed distribution of vehicles (MDVRPFD);  to model the practicable cases in applications. Two-stage and one-stage solution algorithms are also proposed. The industry participators can apply our new one-stage algorithm to solve the MDVRPFD directly and efficiently. Moreover;  our one-stage solution framework allows users to smoothly add new specified constraints or variants.
