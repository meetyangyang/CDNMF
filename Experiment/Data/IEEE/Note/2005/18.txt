- This paper permits an engineer to analyze the state of constraint of an assembly;  mechanism;  or fixture in order to see if it is properly constrained or whether it contains unwanted overconstraints. Overconstraint can lead to locked-in stress;  incorrect tolerance analysis;  and lack of robustness in a design. Very small changes in the sizes of parts or positions of locators in fixtures can have large effects on locations of parts;  deformation;  or internal stresses. Proper constraint is desirable because it provides for only one way to assemble parts. Operator dependency is eliminated;  assembly is quick and repeatable;  and special skin is not needed.
