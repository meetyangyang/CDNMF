This paper was motivated by the problem of automatically planning tool paths for spray forming using Programmable Powdered Preforming Process (P4) technology. However;  the proposed approach can be applied to other surface manufacturing applications such as spray painting;  spray cleaning;  rapid tooling;  etc. Existing tool planning approaches are not able to handle complicated;  multi-patch surfaces. This paper proposes a methodology to partition complicated surfaces into easy-to-handle patches and generate tool paths with optimized thickness uniformity and tool motion performance. We tested the approach using simulation on sample automotive body parts and proved its feasibility. However;  this approach requires that the parts to be sprayed belong to the sheet-metal type so that the part geometry can be analyzed on a plane. In our future research;  we will run physical tests on actual parts and investigate the deposition effects on the thickness uniformity.
