- Yield is an important competitiveness determinant for thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display (TFT LCD) factories. TFT-LCD contains three major manufacturing sectors: the array;  cell and module assembly processes. The yield loss from the cell process is one of the most critical steps. This study first formulates a linear programming for the TFT color-filter plates-matching problem in the cell process and a reduction algorithm then is developed to reduce the computational efforts. Our proposed approach is workable and it does not require a significant investment to produce yield improvement by applying the proposed matching algorithm.
