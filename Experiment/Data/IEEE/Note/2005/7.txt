Through the work presented We hope to move a step closer to the ultimate vision of an automated system for generating optimal or near-optimal production schedules. The peripheral conditions for such a system are ripe with the increasingly widespread adoption of enterprise information systems and plant floor tracking systems based on bar code or wireless technologies. One of the remaining obstacles;  however;  is the fact that scheduling problems arising from many production environments;  including job-shops;  are extremely difficult to solve. Motivated by recent success of local search methods in solving the job-shop scheduling problem;  we propose a new diversification technique based on relaxing and subsequently reimposing the capacity constraints on some critical operations. We integrate this technique into a fast tabu search algorithm and are able to demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive computational experiments. In future research;  we will consider other diversification techniques that are not restricted to critical operations.
