This paper was motivated by the problem of performance analysis and optimization of supply chains but it also applies to other discrete event systems where materials are processed in finite discrete quantities (batches) and operations are performed in a batch way because of batch inputs and/or in order to take advantages of the economies of scale. Existing Petri net modeling and analysis tools for such systems ignore their batch features;  making their modeling complicated. This paper suggests a new model called batch deterministic and stochastic Petri nets (BDSPNs) by enhancing deterministic and stochastic Petri nets with batch places and batch tokens. Methods for structural and performance analysis of the model are developed. We then show how an inventory system and a real-life supply chain can be modeled and their performances can be evaluated analytically and by simulation respectively based on the model. The model and associated analysis methods therefore provide a promising tool for modeling and performance evaluation of supply chains.
