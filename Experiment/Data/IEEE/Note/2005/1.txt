Software design in the industrial automation arena becomes more challenging nowadays than ever;  due to the increasingly complicated industrial processes and more demanding measurement tasks. This paper presents a flexible automatic test system (ATS) for rotating-turbine machinery based on the systematic object-oriented (OO) software engineering. In this OO method;  the process of software development is divided into five major phases: requirement capture;  analysis;  design;  programming;  and testing. Requirement capture collects both functional and nonfunctional user requirements for developing the intended system. In the analysis phase;  the objects in the problem domain are modeled;  and the desired system operations are studied. In the design phase;  the results obtained from the analysis phase are converted into a form that can be implemented using programming languages. In the design phase;  the issues on how the structures are formed and how they collaborate with one another via interfaces are figured out. In the programming phase;  the code for realizing the target system is developed. Finally;  in the test phase;  the system is tested against the specified requirements to ensure its correctness in both functionality and performance aspects. By adopting the OO software-development method;  the flexible ATS for turbine machinery software is developed in an efficient manner. Meanwhile;  other novel technologies such as configuration;  database management;  graphical user interface;  Internet;  multithreaded programming;  and ActiveX Automation are all incorporated into the system development. The method discussed in the paper can be easily extended to the development of other software-intensive industrial automation systems.
