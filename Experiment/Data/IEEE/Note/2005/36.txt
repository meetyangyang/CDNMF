The empirical paint deposition models developed herein;  which are fit to experimental data;  offer a significant improvement over models that are typically used in industrial robot simulations. The improved simulation results come without the computational cost and complexity of finite element methods. The models could be incorporated;  as is;  into existing industrial simulation tools;  provided the users are cognizant of the model limitations with respect to highly curved surfaces. Although the models are based on readily available information;  incorporating the models into existing robot simulation software would likely require support from the software vendor.
