This paper was motivated by the problem of controlling the maximum number of waiting lots in buffers below the buffer capacity limit in the fabrication of color liquid crystal display thin film transistor (LCD-TFT )panels. The problem originally arose in production control systems such as a manufacturing execution system (MES)or an event-driven simulator which decides the start timing of each lot operation. Conventional methods for controlling the queue length of each buffer have a mechanism which checks whether the buffer on the downstream side of the current process step will overflow and decides whether or not to start the operation at the current process step based on the result. In the conventional methods, the throughput degradation problem is caused by the redundant blocking time at an equipment group where the buffer capacity is smaller than the total number of upstream equipment units. This paper proposes a method using an event-driven mechanism incrementally.
