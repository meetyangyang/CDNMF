This work was motivated by the problems faced by bedridden patients as well as caregivers in the healthcare industry. The labor-intensive repositioning and transfer of bedridden patients are performed with a robotic system supervised by a single caregiver. Our repositioning scheme uses the bed sheet for rolling and moving the patient and closely mimics the current practice prevalent in nursing homes and hospitals. Our approach will be a natural alternative to manual repositioning and transfer and will be acceptable for most caregivers and patients. Initial prototyping and experiments have been completed in consultation with a professional caregiver.
