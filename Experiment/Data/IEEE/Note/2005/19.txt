This paper was motivated to reduce the number of machine tools which were used in connecting electric plugs in factory. But;  this work is also applied to assembly machines which require inserting a round peg into a round hole. The existing machine tool can connect only one electric peg with fixed length;  so various machine tools are needed according to the lengths of plugs. The proposed idea shows the way to solve this problem. By extending working capacity of the machine tool;  it is possible that electric plugs with various lengths are connected by one machine tool and;  consequently;  the changing time and cost of machine tools can be reduced. The developed method removes changing of the machine tool. However;  manual adjustment of the proposed machine tool is still needed to connect electric plugs with various lengths. Therefore;  in the future research;  motorized adjusting structure will be added to the proposed idea to improve manual adjustment of the machine tool.
