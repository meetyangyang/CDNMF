Scheduling and control problems for modern man-made systems;  including automated manufacturing systems such as cluster tools for semiconductor manufacturing;  microcircuits;  and real-time software systems;  are usually modeled as discrete event systems. Such systems often have strict time constraints on timings of some events. Our results can be used for identifying whether there can be a feasible schedule that satisfies all time constraints;  computing the range of the feasible cycle times;  and determining a steady schedule with the minimum cycle time. By using the feasibility condition;  we also can accommodate the system configuration;  the task times;  and the task sequence so that the system can satisfy the time constraints while meeting the target cycle time. Such practice is already used for real cluster tool engineering. We have more results on implementing a real-time scheduler and controller for time constrained systems.
