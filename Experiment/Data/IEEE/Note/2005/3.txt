In designing assembly systems;  the layout of stations and the assignment of assembly tasks to these stations are important design problems. This paper proposes a set of algorithms to quickly generate the configurations of the assembly system and assign tasks to the configurations. Once the matching of tasks to the configurations is complete;  the performance of these various design alternatives;  such as productivity;  can be evaluated to allow selection of configurations with the best performance.
