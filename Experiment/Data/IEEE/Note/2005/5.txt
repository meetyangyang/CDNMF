This paper solves decision problems in supply chain management raised by the increasing prevalence of Internet-based collaborative manufacturing, short product life cycles and the proliferation of product families. Existing approaches and models, in supply chain management, that are commonly available to practitioners do not handle either of these areas adequately. Traditionally, the focus of supply chain planning tools has been on the selection of optimal locations for establishment of distribution facilities, and on the determination of optimal stocking levels at these locations. We steer away from this direction to build models that instead optimally select, and coordinate with, partners, in Internet-based virtual supply chain networks that have flourished in recent years. In addition, the model presented in this paper also incorporates a hitherto unseen functionality to configure the supply chain based on the rollout plans for new product introductions and the disposal schedule for older products. In terms of application, this model would be extremely useful to supply chain managers, particularly in discrete manufacturing industries such as consumer electronics and automotive, to analyze the costs and benefits involved in pursuing alternative product introduction plans and deadlines. Such a framework might be employed to determine the optimal product introduction schedule. We show here that in some cases it might not be profitable to launch a product in the market after a certain period of time. This model can also provide a means for the development team to understand the operational and financial impact of alternative product designs, having different bill of materials, on the manufacturing and distribution ramp-up plan..
