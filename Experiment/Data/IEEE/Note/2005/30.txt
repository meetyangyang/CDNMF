Discrete-event systems are often man-made systems such as transportation systems;  computer communication networks;  distributed software;  and manufacturing systems. They typically involve the flow of information and physical goods through a network. The flow itself evolves in continuous time but the initiation or completion of the event happens at a discrete point in time. Analyzing the system's performance is key to their successful operation. This paper presents a new approach to performance analysis with application to supply-chain management.
