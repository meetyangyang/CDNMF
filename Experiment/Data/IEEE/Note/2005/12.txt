- Delivery and postal services around the world currently use sacks to hold letters;  magazines;  and small boxes. The considerable weight of these sacks;  their lack of handles;  eyelets;  or other operator interfaces;  and the unpredictable shape and size of the packages within create awkward and uncomfortable handling predicaments for mail handlers at all U.S. Postal Service distribution centers. Currently;  no robotic hand or end-effector is commercially available to grab and hold sacks effectively;  so sacks must be handled manually by postal employees in distribution centers. This paper describes the design of a novel robotic end-effector for manipulating deformable objects with undefined shapes;  such as sacks and bags. This device;  which does not mimic human hand architecture;  is simple and practical; it makes use of the friction between two rotating rollers to grab sack material when it is in close proximity of the end-effector. The rollers cease rotation when sufficient sack material is collected between the rollers to support the sack. They reverse their rotation;  and turn outwardly to release the sack again. This end-effector is able to grab a sack at any point;  does not require the edge of the sack to be gathered and flattened prior to grasp;  does not require the sack to be placed on its bottom;  needs no operator intervention;  does not use the weight of the sack to lock and secure the sack in the end-effector;  and does not damage the sack contents.
