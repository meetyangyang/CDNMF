This project was motivated by the need for a simple free piston engine that is capable of producing hydraulic power. A free piston engine has no crankshaft or rotating motion;  only a piston assembly that is constrained to move in a linear fashion within a bore. The energy of the free piston can be harnessed by pressurizing a working fluid or generating electrical power. Instead of relying on the combustion of gasoline or diesel fuel to move the free piston;  which involves problems with fuel/air mixing and ignition timing;  we created a device that is powered by the catalytic decomposition of a monopropellant. This concept overcomes the problems with a combustion powered free piston engine and also affords operation in environments with no atmosphere;  such as underwater or in space. The device we constructed is an integrated free piston engine and hydraulic pump with very few moving parts. This monopropellant free piston engine could be adapted for use with any source of pressurized gas (preferably one with a high specific energy) and could be scaled to varying power outputs. The largest hurdle to overcome before realizing reliable operation of the free piston hydraulic pump (FPHP) is ensuring that the catalyst effectively decomposes the monopropellant.
