In theory;  transfer lines or flow lines generate high throughput with low work-in-process. In reality;  the benefit can be achieved only if the line is free of interruptions and is balanced. In most manufacturing systems;  interruptions are common due to setups;  material replenishments;  errors and occasional machine breakdowns. An interrupted station can stop the entire line quickly in a transfer or flow line. In addition;  in most modern manufacturing systems;  the batch sizes become smaller and smaller. When the batches are very small (in extreme case;  batch size of 1);  it is almost impossible to achieve perfect balance when different jobs are processed in the same line. In both cases;  the parallel segments in the line can increase the throughput without increasing the work-in-process. This paper presented the evidence via analytical models and simulation.
