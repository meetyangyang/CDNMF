This paper was motivated by the problem of cyclic scheduling of a no-wait production line;  where a part must be processed without any interruption either on or between machines due to characteristics of the processing technology itself or the absences of storage capacity between operations of a part. Multi-degree schedules;  in which multiple parts enter and leave the line during a cycle;  usually have larger throughput rate than simple ones. This paper proposes an algorithm for multi-degree cyclic scheduling of a no-wait flowshop with two robots. Computational results show that the throughput rate can be really improved by using multi-degree schedules with two robots. However;  we have not addressed the decision of the optimal value of the degree of the cycle. Furthermore;  since we consider that the two robots travel along parallel tracks;  the collision-avoidance constraints have been relaxed in the algorithm. In future research;  we will address the two problems and generalize the algorithm to multi-robot cases.
