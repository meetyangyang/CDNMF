The staircase effect has been the major concern for industry to widely adopt rapid prototyping technologies. It will not only worsen the surface quality but also create errors on the parts built. This paper introduces a novel approach to minimizing staircase errors based on a multidirectional deposition approach. A mathematical method combined with a generic algorithm is used to minimize the slicing errors. From the case study given;  the approach has been proven to be effective in minimizing staircase errors and thus improving the rapid prototyping (RP) built part quality.
