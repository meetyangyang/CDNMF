- Many large volume manufacturing systems consist of complex operations;  for instance;  assembly;  disassembly;  rework loop;  parallel lines;  feedforward lines;  scrap;  etc. Development of a performance evaluation method to provide fast and accurate analysis of system throughput is important for design and continuous improvements. This paper introduces a system-theoretic method;  referred to as;  overlapping decomposition;  to analyze the performance of such complex manufacturing systems. The complex system is decomposed into overlapped serial production lines and modifications are introduced to accommodate the coupling effects among all these lines. From the theoretical point of view;  this paper presents the proofs of the convergence of recursive procedures and the uniqueness of solution. From the application point of view;  the method has obtained good results in solving practical problems on the factory floor.
