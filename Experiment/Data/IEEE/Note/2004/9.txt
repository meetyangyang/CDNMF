Two approaches in configuring parallel manufacturing lines are currently being used in industrial plants. These have been characterized as the Japanese approach of parallel independent cells of serial operations;  and the European approach of a serial line with each operation being duplicated in parallel. The European approach has a productivity advantage over the Japanese approach when considering machine failures within each operation. However;  the European approach requires more material handling which increases the configuration complexity and can reduce productivity. A math model is developed to determine which approach is best for a given line design when line length is defined by process planning and line balancing;  and line width is determined by throughput requirements. The analysis is limited to cell configurations that do not use buffers internal to the cell.
