Economic globalization brings intense competition among manufacturing enterprises. The key to succeed in this competitive climate is to rapidly respond to fast-changing market demands with high-quality and competitively priced products. To achieve this;  we need to quickly identify root causes of quality-related problems in a complicated manufacturing system. However;  the current widely adopted quality-control techniques focus more on monitoring than on root-cause identification. These techniques can efficiently detect the changes in the process but the root cause identification is often left to the plant engineers or operators. In this paper;  a systematic estimation and testing method is proposed to identify the variational root causes in multistage manufacturing processes. First;  a linear model is built based on the design information to describe the cause-effect relationship between the process faults and product quality. Then;  an algorithm is developed to estimate the mean and variance of the process faults from the quality measurements of products. Finally;  a statistical testing method is developed to determine if process faults (i.e. root causes) exist in terms of statistical significance. A detailed experimental study illustrates the effectiveness of this method. The method presented in this paper is a new quality-control technique and can be used for quality improvement of multistage manufacturing processes.
