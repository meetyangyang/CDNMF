This paper was motivated by the problem of planning a fixture locator layout in a multistation assembly process. Existing approaches generally focused on planning fixture locator layouts on a single workstation. In a multistation production process;  such as an automobile body assembly process;  the fixture locating holes used on one station will be reused on different stations;  which could cause a station-to-station coupling in variation propagation. In other words;  dimensional variation could originate from fixture elements on every station;  propagate along the production line;  and accumulate on the final assembly. Station-wise fixture layout design may not necessarily lead to a good solution because it overlooks the variation coupling and propagation effect. In this paper;  we modeled the variation propagation across multiple stations and provided a quantitative characterization of the performance of fixture layout with the presence of environmental noises. Then;  we recommended an efficient computation algorithm to solve for the optimal fixture layout. Our results showed that the multistation layout design is different from a single station one; some intuitions gained from single-station design work may not be still valid. The current work is based on a two-dimensional;  rigid panel assembly model. The extension to accommodate more sophisticated two-dimensional;  complaint-part assembly processes is much needed in the future research.
