RP has being used as an essential augmented tool between CAD and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) for product manufacturing. RP uses layered manufacturing technology to produce complicated prototypes directly from a CAD model. As imaging;  materials;  and processing techniques improve;  RP functions such as assembly fit;  tooling masters;  prototype tools;  and prototype parts are made possible. RP technology that can construct parts of multiple materials;  colors;  and even parts composed of composite materials will soon be available. In this paper;  an RP machine system which combines PC-based controller with thermal extrusion method is presented. Low-cost ABS pellets are used for thermal extrusion;  although the system is easily adapted to other not-too-dissimilar materials. Based on the experimental results;  the proposed RP mechatronics system can produce good quality RP parts. In this paper;  a new adaptive slicing algorithm is developed to decrease fabrication time without much reducing the model accuracy. According to this algorithm;  the 3-D CAD model can be sliced with different thickness automatically. With this adaptive slicing method;  the part can be fabricated much faster than it uses traditional uniform slicing method. Finally;  the intelligent web-based RP system has been developed which allows remote users to upload a CAD file of the part;  direct building up of the physical model;  and monitoring of the actual fabrication process from a CCD camera located in the RP machine itself. The greatest advantage is that user does not need to buy an expensive RP machine; instead he rents time and uses the machine remotely via the Internet. This really drastically reduces the production development cycle for the highly competitive time-to-market challenge.
