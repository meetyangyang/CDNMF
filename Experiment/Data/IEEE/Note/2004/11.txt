In practice;  the machinist applies excessive force to hold the part on machine table;  so that it does not move when machining is carried out. However;  while machining flexible parts or clamping on finished surfaces;  care must be taken so that only necessary and optimal clamping forces are applied;  to avoid deforming the part or damaging the surface. Therefore;  in this study;  we have developed a mathematical model to characterize the mechanics and conditions for a fixture to hold a given part. The developed mathematical model computes the optimal clamping forces required to hold the part in position;  given the cutting conditions. The result obtained was verified by conducting the machining test using the developed sensor-embedded experimental fixture setup. The FEM was also developed to predict the behavior of fixture-workpiece system and the results obtained were encouraging.
