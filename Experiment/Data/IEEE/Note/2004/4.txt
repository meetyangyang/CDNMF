This paper builds a bridge between mechanical design tolerancing and supply-chain management. In particular;  the paper explores the use of statistical tolerancing techniques in achieving outstanding delivery performance through variability reduction. Informally;  a six sigma supply chain is that which delivers products within a customer specified delivery window;  with at most 3.4 missed deliveries per million. The innovations in this paper are the following: 1) to define two performance metrics delivery probability and delivery sharpness to describe the precision and accuracy of deliveries;  in terms of process capability indexes C/sub p/; C/sub pk/;  and C/sub pm/; 2) to formulate the supply-chain design optimization problem using the process capability indices; 3) to suggest an efficient solution procedure for the design optimization problem. The paper presents the case study of a two-echelon distribution network and using the framework developed in the paper shows the role of inventory in controlling lead time variability and achieving six sigma levels of delivery performance.
