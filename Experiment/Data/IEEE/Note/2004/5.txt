An HICS that handles the information flow of the supply chain is proposed in this work. HICS is composed of many communication holons (CHs). Any company that would like to use HICS to exchange information for enterprise integration may possess a CH. The CH is implemented with the Java web-start technology. Therefore;  any company can download a CH from the web server via a web browser. The company is;  then;  able to communicate with other members throughout the supply chain. Accordingly;  CHs are scattered throughout the Internet/intranet and each CH can act as both an information supplier and an information consumer. Further;  because the CH adopts the RoesettaNet implementation framework (RNIF);  any company that has the capability of RNIF can also communicate with the members in the HICS framework via RosettaNet business messages.
