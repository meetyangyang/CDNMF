This paper presents three new quality functions for comparing and planning grasps and fixtures. These measures improve on the traditional measure of force closure. We propose a method for computing the optimal solutions of these functions;  and a method for reducing their computation time through reasonable simplification/approximation. Preliminary experiments with a three-fingered robotic hand demonstrate that the proposed functions can be used to optimize the grasp quality during manipulation/manufacturing;  and keep the optimal grasp configuration once it is reached. However;  we only obtain the local optimal solutions for the functions without simplification except for some special cases. We also assume that the object/workpiece is ideally rigid in all three functions. In future research;  we will improve these limitations through a compliance model.
