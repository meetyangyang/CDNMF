Once parts have been brought together in an automated assembly sequence;  they typically must be repositioned to complete fastening or welding operations. This can be done with powerful robots capable of grasping and carrying the assembly and may involve a unique fixture to maintain the assembly during transport. A cheaper and more flexible alternative is to use a less powerful robot that can push the assembly along a horizontal surface without the aid of fixtures. This work presents a graphical method that produces conservative bounds on the pushing motions that guarantee the stability of a linear assembly (i.e.;  a stock of parts) during the push. The main application is in motion planning for assembly sequencing but the results could also he useful;  for example;  for mobile robots pushing multiple boxes in a warehouse. The method can be made robust to uncertainty in The mass properties of the parts;  such as boxes with unknown contents. It is limited to linear stacks of parts where each part pushes no more than one other part In future work;  we plan to devise a method to compute stable pushing motions for arbitrary assemblies of parts.
