This paper was motivated by the problem of holding sheet-metal parts for automobile bodies but it also applies to other sheet-metal components that have cut or stamped holes. Existing approaches to fixturing such parts generally have contacting mechanisms on both sides of the sheet that restrict access for welding or inspection. This paper suggests a new approach using pairs of grooved cylinders;  activated from only one side of the part (hence \unilateral\). These cylinders mate with opposing corners of holes in the sheet and push apart to hold the sheet in tension;  thus acting as both locators and clamps. In this paper;  we mathematically characterize the mechanics and conditions for a unilateral fixture to hold a given part. We then show how such fixtures can be efficiently computed; this can allow a computer-aided design (CAD) system (with finite element capability) to automatically generate and propose unilateral fixtures for a given part. Preliminary physical experiments suggest that this approach is feasible but it has not yet been incorporated into a CAD system nor tested in production. In future research;  we will address the design of unilateral fixtures that hold two or more parts simultaneously for welding.
