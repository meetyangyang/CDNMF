Backlash universally exists in gear transmissions where the moving parts temporarily lose direct contact, which is a major factor affecting the systems dynamic performance and steady precision. Existing approaches for eliminating backlash nonlinearity are mainly divided to two categories due to the nondifferentiable property of the traditional deadzone model: one is the inverse model compensation method, which is not preferable in practical applications for the existence of physical inertia; the other is a multimodel switching method that divides the controlled system into several subsystems and then designs controllers for each subsystem, which makes the control design problem very complex and difficult. Motivated by these, this paper proposes a “soft degree” concept based on a recently developed differentiable deadzone model, and then presents a practical backstepping algorithm to achieve not only high-precision output tracing but also limit cycles elimination.
