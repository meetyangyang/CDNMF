Blood collection is a crucial activity inhealthcare and ensuring regional self-sufficiency of blood supplyis a mission of regional blood services. Bloodmobile collection isparticularly important as over 70% of blood is collected at mobilesites. Efforts are made in this paper to develop applicable mathematical models for bloodmobile collection planning by takinginto account relevant information. Donation forecast is made bytaking into account demographics, donor generosity and availability. Blood sufficiency is modeled by blood inventory, regionaldonations and blood imported from or offered to other regions.Relevant resources are considered including equipment for bloodpreparation and qualification, physicians, nurses, secretaries, anddrivers. Regulations concerning donors and staff personnel are considered. Numerical experiments based on field data show thebenefits of appropriate bloodmobile collection planning.
