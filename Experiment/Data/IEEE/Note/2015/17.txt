This work is motivated by the followingproblem we were posed by a car manufacturer: To measure themovement of an engine during test drives, sensors were placedonto the motor compartment of a car. With this setup the sensorsrecorded the position and orientation of the engine every 5 ms. Thereason for these test drives were clearance checks between parts ofthe engine and other components, fixated on the chassis, e.g., theoil pan and a neighboring component, cf. Fig. 1. We are now interested in the following question: Which volume in space does thevibrating part of the engine occupy? We here present a methodthat approximatively computes the outer boundary of this volumethat is also called the swept volume. The model that generates thevolume (hence generator) will be a CAD model, that is swept (henceswept volume) along the sequence of motions (trajectory).A trajectory can of course also come from CAD and/or assemblyplanning, as for instance in [10]. The scenario depicted in Fig. 2shows a user-created path during maintainability analysis. Theswept volume (or rather its outer boundary) can be used to verify that the path is collision free and that spatial tolerances are notviolated. In contrast to previous methods that compute the sweptvolume, our swept volume approximation is reliable, meaning,that we give guarantees on the quality of our approximation interms of how close we are to the actual swept volume.Future work would be, for instance, the extension of our approach to kinematic chains, e.g., the swept volume of a car seatunder all possible configurations.
