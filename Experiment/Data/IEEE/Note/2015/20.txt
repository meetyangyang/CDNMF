This paper, motivated by the problem ofcombustion monitoring in steel tube manufacturing, focuses on thedevelopment of effective methods for process monitoring basedon image data. Existing process monitoring techniques cannotfully utilize the information of color images due to the high-dimensionality and complex correlation structure of such data. Thispaper addresses this problem by extracting essential monitoringfeatures, while considering the spatial and spectral correlationof color images. This is accomplished by using various low-ranktensor decomposition methods along with multivariate controlcharts. The proposed approach can lead to a computer-aidedonline monitoring system for automatic detection of out-of-controlsituations in a process. Using simulation, the performance of thedeveloped methods is compared under various scenarios. Thiscan provide practitioners with useful guidelines for selectingan appropriate method for image-based process monitoring. Infuture research, we will study the development of image-basedfault diagnosis techniques that can be integrated with the processmonitoring approaches proposed in this paper.
