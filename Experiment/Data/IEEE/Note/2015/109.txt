Experiments were performed using a real mobile robot system in a typical indoor environment. The results show that noise can be eliminated using the proposed methods and the corridor type can be identified efficiently and robustly. Based on the generated topological map, the robot can localize and navigate itself autonomously. Therefore, such a mobile robot can be applied to the hazard industrial environments like offshore oil platform replacing human workers. Instead of utilizing huge image data, the method is based on simple depth curve and thus requires very low memory and computational resources. Furthermore, because the localization and navigation are based on pure topological representation, the developed techniques are compatible with human knowledge and can be directly implemented in the industrial application to realize man-machine collaboration.
