Reducing the work flow disruptions onsurgery in emergency care and operating rooms is of significant importance. Although many efforts have been devoted to observingand categorizing various disruption types, frequencies, and durations, how to identify the most critical disruptions which are impeding the normal operations in the strongest manner has not beenstudied yet. In this paper, such disruptions are referred to as thebottleneck disruptions, whose reduction can lead to the largest improvement in ensuring normal status in surgical operations. However, the bottleneck disruption is a result of interactions among allfactors in the system and may not be the one that has the longestdisruption time or the highest frequency. To identify the bottleneck disruptions, a continuous-time Markov chain model has beendeveloped to analyze the work flow. Using the observation dataof disruptions collected in emergency care surgery, such as eachdisruptionâ€™s time percentage, duration, and its resulting interruption time, etc., simple indicators have been derived to identify thebottleneck disruptions without complicated calculations of system performance and its sensitivities (i.e., partial derivatives). To illustrate the applicability of this study, such a model and indicatorshave been applied at an emergency department of a large academicmedical center. It is discovered that the disruptions due to coordination problem and equipment failure are the system bottleneckswith respect to disruption time and frequency, respectively. In addition, such disruptions are not necessarily the disruption with thelongest duration or the highest occurrence, respectively.
