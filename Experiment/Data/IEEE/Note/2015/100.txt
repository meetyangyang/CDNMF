This paper is motivated by the practical navigation problem in 3DUS-guided beating-heart robotic surgery. A real-time and robust robot guidance system is of great significance in computer-assisted and computer-navigated robotic surgeries. The current position-based ultrasound guidance systems typically involve sequential feature extraction followed by position estimation, while the proposed intensity-based ultrasound virtual servoing can directly track both tissue and instruments from the raw 3D images. Without necessitating segmentation or feature extraction, the proposed approach is efficient enough to be used in guiding the surgical robot to the target using real-time 3DUS. The implementation is based on virtual probe servoing and can be extended to other similar volumetric image-based servoing problems in industrial applications. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as a plug-in module, which could be easily integrated into existing image-guided robotic surgery platforms.
