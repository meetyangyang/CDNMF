Many cyberphysical systems, such asbuilding automation systems, automotive vehicles and smartpower grids, can be modeled as stochastic systems with mixed continuous and discrete dynamics subject to disturbance and noise,whose behaviors are monitored and controlled by networked(digital) control systems. This paper investigates fault detection inthe form of temporal logic specification violation in model-basedapproach, by transforming it into a state estimation problem forstochastic system models. We provide an algorithm for online faultdetection and introduce the notion of Stochastic-Diagnosability forthe existence of a detector with any desired accuracy of detectionas measured by false alarms and missed detections. The work isillustrated by a room heating system example.
