Teams of small robots have the potential to automate many information gathering tasks;  relaying data back to a base station or human operator from multiple vantage points within an environment. The information gathering tasks we consider in this work are those in which the number of objects being sought is not known at the onset of exploration. Such tasks are common in security and surveillance;  where the number of such objects is often zero; search and rescue;  where;  for example;  the number of people trapped due to a natural disaster can be large; or smart building/smart city applications;  where the data collection needs may be on an even larger scale. This paper seeks to address the problem of automating this data collection process;  so that a team of mobile sensor platforms are able to autonomously explore a given environment in order to determine the number of objects of interest and their locations;  while avoiding any explicit data association;  i.e.;  matching individual measurements to targets.
