 Offline high-speed cameras have beenused for cell-shape analysis, however, the measurable speeds ofcells in microchannel flows are limited by their frame intervals,because their frame intervals are not small enough to capture thefast apparent motion of cells magnified in microscopic view. Oursystem can overcome this restriction, and operates as a real-timeinspection tool for cells flowing in microchannels at several metersper second, where their shapes are deformed corresponding totheir mechanical properties. Lab-on-a-chip practitioners caneasily apply it to cells fast-flowing in microchannels, such as redblood cells or iPS cells, which should be inspected by checking thesize, shape, stiffness, and other image-based parameters, towardautomated mass production of good-quality cells.
