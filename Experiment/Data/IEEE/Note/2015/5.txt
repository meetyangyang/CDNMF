The paper analyzes the control problem ofswitching offâ€“on a machine tool for energy saving during the idletimes. Different control policies are investigated pointing out themost significant factors. A mapping of the optimal control policy asa function of warm-up time and mean part arrival time is also provided. An algorithm is described for identifying the optimal controlparameters. The results of this research will be useful for a practical implementation of a switching policy for energy saving. Thisimplementation requires the fitting of the distribution modellingthe part arrival times, the estimation of the warm-up time, and theestimation of the power adsorbed by the machine in four differentstates.
