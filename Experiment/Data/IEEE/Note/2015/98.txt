The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) has important applications in textile, automobile assembly, semiconductor manufacturing, and many other industries. In the flexible job shop, a group of machines are capable for each operation, which is different from the traditional job shop environment where each operation can be processed by only a single machine. The FJSP is quite challenging, since the decisions include not only operation sequencing but also machine assignment. In the literature, the majority of studies for the FJSP are centered on optimizing the makespan. However, a single objective is deemed as insufficient for real and practical applications. Indeed, in the industry, production managers are usually concerned with more than one objective. This paper aims to simultaneously minimize the makespan, total workload, and critical workload for the FJSP, which can lead to both high throughput and load balance of machines. This problem is solved in the posterior approach, whose goal is to seek for a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We propose effective memetic algorithms (MAs) that combine a classical multiobjective evolutionary technique referred as NSGA-II with a novel problem-specific local search. To enhance the ability to deal with multiple objectives, a hierarchical strategy is used in local search which gives varying degrees of consideration to each objective. The effectiveness of the proposed MAs is well demonstrated by extensive comparisons against the existing best-performing algorithms for the considered problem. This work can be extended to those practical problems in the flexible manufacturing system. In addition, the idea to deal with objectives hierarchically can be generalized for the other production scheduling problems with multiple objectives, such as hybrid flow shop, blocking flow shop, and no-wait job shop.
