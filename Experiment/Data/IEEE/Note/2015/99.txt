This paper was motivated by the problem of self-diagnosis in communication networks. The root cause identification process used currently consists of testing all of the network metrics without any prior knowledge of the dependency model. This process ignores the causal relationships which may exist between the network components. This paper suggests an approach based on prior modeling dependencies between metrics that compose a network (i.e., packet loss or jitter). The dependency model is achieved through a graph theory technique known as “Bayesian Network.” Upon the detection of a failure, the approach considers only the most relevant metrics for the detected fault. The diagnosis consists of inferring the root cause using an algorithm based on the combination of Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning techniques. For the evaluation, observations collected from concrete network monitoring were used. This evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of automation, speed, accuracy and reliability.
