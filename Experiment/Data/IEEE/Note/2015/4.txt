To fully realize the enormous potential offunctional nanodevices, automated, scalable methods are neededto manipulate and assemble nanowires and nanotubes with controlled orientations at specific spatial locations. This paper presentsone such technique for the automated motion planning, controland manipulation of individual nanowires suspended in a fluid.The design uses a set of electrode arrays to drive and orientatethe nanowire from one location to the target location under electrophoretic and electro-osmotic forces. The motion modeling andcontrol of an individual nanowire in fluid suspension are first presented to guide the nanowire to follow a given trajectory. Then,using the symmetry of the electric-field distribution, we presenttwo heuristic nanowire motion planning algorithms to reduce thecomputational complexity. The algorithms are demonstrated andvalidated through experiments. We finally present several experiments demonstrating the steering and positioning of individualand multiple (in sequence) nanowires in a fluid suspension to formgeometric patterns. The results will help provide a foundation forscalable, automated methods for manipulating nanowires to buildnanodevices.
