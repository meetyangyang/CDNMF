This work concerns the sustainable management problem for locating an automotive service enterprise.To deal with such an issue, this work proposes a novel sustainableanalysis method. The previous research handles such a problemthrough a methodology based on the traditional economicalmethod, which is not enough without considering sustainablefactors, e.g., energy consumption and carbon emission. The goalof this work is to establish the energy-efficient models for locatingan automotive service enterprise with carbon emission constraint,i.e., to meet the specific requirement of carbon emission assuredlywhile minimizing the transportation energy/fuel consumption ofservice customers. Both theoretical and simulated results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and feasible. Suchresults can help decision makers perform better judgments whena practical automotive service enterprise is executed.
