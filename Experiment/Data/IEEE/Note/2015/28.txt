The mission length and operations of anyunderwater application such as data collection, environmentalmonitoring, and undersea exploration are severely limited bybattery capacity of AUVs. During the course of a mission, manycomputation-intensive tasks have to be executed, along with establishing communication with other vehicles in the team, whichleads to further consumption of battery capacity. In this paper,a communication framework is introduced that expands theresources (computation and data resources) available to the teamof AUVs by including public Clouds. A public Cloud consists in aset of networked computers that provide a range of computationand storage resources on demand and at a nominal price. Aresource provisioning engine is designed to share the workloadbetween local and Cloud resources based on communicationcost, computation cost, and battery capacity. Such a frameworkenables increasing the lifetime of vehicles, execution of tasks withhigher accuracy, and exploitation of any external information inthe Cloud that is not available to a team of AUVs in the field.
