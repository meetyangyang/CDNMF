In this paper;  we present provably good multirobot task assignment algorithms;  while considering practical constraints like task deadlines and limited battery life of robots. Such constraints are relevant in many applications including parts movement by robots in manufacturing;  delivery of goods by unmanned vehicles;  and search and rescue operations. Our solution is applicable to a group of heterogeneous robots with different suitability (i.e.;  payoffs) for different tasks. Our distributed approach is independent of the underlying robot communication network topology;  and thus can be applied to a wide range of robot network deployments. Finally;  our approach is easy to implement;  has low communication requirements;  and it is scalable;  since its running time is linear in the number of robots and tasks.
