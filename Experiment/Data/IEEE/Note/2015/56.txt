This work addresses the deployment oflarge scale floating structures to accelerate humanitarian missionsor disaster relief by assembling together many self-propelled ISOshipping containers equipped with actuators and sensors. Thousands of modules would be needed to form temporary bridges, harbors, or air strips in a full-scale deployment; we give efficient solutions to the ensuing large-scale assembly planning and multiboatrouting problems. This work will be of interest to those consideringassembly planning with many identical pieces. Our 1:12 scale experiments serve as a proof of concept system and a case study inthe design of practical self-assembling components. The dockingand maneuverability design elements will be of interest to those addressing self-reconfiguration in marine environments. We discuss tools and strategies which address the practical challenge ofdeveloping software for dozens of interacting robots, all floatingout of physical reach. The approaches described here currently donot apply to arbitrary three-dimensional structures, or heterogeneously shaped elements.
