Efficient and effective SCC schedule is vital for the manufacturing system of iron and steel production. Unfortunately;  the scheduling is extremely difficult because of its combinatorial nature and practical complex constraints such as job grouping constraints;  precedence constraints;  different transport time;  and setup times. To obtain high-quality solutions within an acceptable computational time;  we can use a problem-oriented approach;  which can be the LR. However;  there are two deficiencies in this approach: its empirical termination criteria;  such as maximal iteration number or running time;  which make it difficult to find a golden rule for various problems;  and the inefficiency;  which is caused by the so-called zigzagging phenomena. To overcome these deficiencies;  this paper develops an effective subgradient method for SCC scheduling based on the machine capacity relaxation. This method gives an objective termination criterion based on the convergence condition of the method;  and improves the efficiency based on a new search direction or a new subgradient. Then;  the work shows how this method can be applied to solve an SCC scheduling problem. The computational results confirm their effectiveness and efficiency. The approaches can also be applied to other similar production scheduling problems.
