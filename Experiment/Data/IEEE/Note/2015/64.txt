This work was motivated by the limitations of the existing navigation technology for the visuallyimpaired. Most of the existing methods use a point/line measurement sensor for indoor object detection. Therefore, they lackcapability in detecting 3D objects and positioning a blind traveler.Stereovision has been used in recent research. However, it cannotprovide reliable depth data for object detection. Also, it tends toproduce a lower localization accuracy because its depth measurement error quadratically increases with the true distance. Thispaper suggests a new approach for navigating a blind traveler.The method uses a single 3D time-of-flight camera for both 6-DOFPE and 3D object detection and thus results in a small-sized butpowerful RNA. Due to the camera’s constant depth accuracy, theproposed egomotion estimation method results in a smaller errorthan that of existing methods. A new EKF method is proposed tointegrate the egomotion into the RNA’s 6-DOF pose in the worldcoordinate system by tracking both visual and geometric featuresof the operating environment. The proposed method substantiallyreduces the pose error of a standard EKF method and thus supports a longer range navigation task. One limitation of the methodis that it requires a feature-rich environment to work well.
