VMAT delivers a dose in a continuousmanner which requires the dose intensity and aperture shape tobe optimized simultaneously. The resulting treatment planningproblem becomes very difficult to solve. In this paper, we developa nonlinear mathematical model based on control points. Thefrequently used clinical setting such as dose-limit and dose volumeconstraints as well as multi-leaf collimator (MLC) constraintsare considered in the model. We then use a linearization technique to transform the nonlinear treatment planning model to anequivalent mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Theobjective of the MILP model is a penalty function of target underdose and organ at risk (OAR) overdose. Based on the propertyof the MILP treatment planning problem, an effective heuristicmethod based on Nested-Partitions framework is developed tosolve the MILP problem. The output of the model includes thedose intensity and aperture at each control point. As the prescription dose limit and feasibility of change between adjacent controlpoints are ensured in the model, the output is deliverable througha planning system.
