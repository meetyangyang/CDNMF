As technological innovation in the fieldof robotics continues to advance forward at a steady rate, so doesthe complexity of the robotic systems that are the product of thisinnovation. Utilizing these robotic systems for a number of automated tasks in diverse situations requires an increased level ofdeep understanding of the inner workings of the system, which isa burden to the human operator and programmer. To attenuatethis burden, the task of programming itself must move towards automation. This type of automation is the motivation for work presented here. This paper outlines an algorithm for which a complexrobotic system can learn the task of locomoting all on its own. Thepractical application of this research is that more complex roboticsystems can be incorporated into industry with less effort. Thisautomation is accomplished with an innovative approach on whatthe robot needs to learn to achieve its goal. This paper focuses onrobot locomotion but future work will focus on the high degree offreedom stationary robotic arms that are increasingly seen on factory floors.
