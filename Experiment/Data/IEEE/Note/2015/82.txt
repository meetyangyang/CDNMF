To help designers, planners and managers of public bicycle sharing systems (PBSS), performance andoptimization models and decision making tools are unavoidable.The recent momentum of PBSS, as a new mobility option indense urban areas, has not been followed by an intense research.This paper was particularly motivated by the balancing problemstudying the repositioning of bicycles among bicycle stations. Inthis contribution, we deals with a powerful and original Petrinet approach suitable for performance modelling and simulationanalysis for control and balancing purposes of such complexdynamical systems. The authors believe that this new area ofresearch has significant promise for the future and to influenceeconomic viability and operational efficiency of these new urbantransportation systems.
