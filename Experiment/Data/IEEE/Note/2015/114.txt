Welding is the final stage for manufacturing of many high value added products. While industrial welding robots have been in use for several decades, they are preprogrammed actuators with limited, if any, intelligence. Given that manufacturing is moving towards more customized production, next-generation welding robots that can intelligently adjust to various welding tasks are urgently needed. Unfortunately, equipping robots with human knowledge is challenging. This paper establishes a teleoperation system that can rapidly transform human welder knowledge into welding robots. A predictive control approach is developed to accurately track the human hand movement by controlling the speed of the robot arm movement. A foundation is thus established to mechanize the human welder's knowledge and develop next-generation welding robots.
