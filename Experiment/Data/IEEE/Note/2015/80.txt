Piezo-actuated nanopositioning stagesplay an increasingly important role in the fields of scanning probemicroscopy and micro/nano manipulation. They have the advantages of fast response, large force, and fine resolution. However,such stages inherently exhibit vibration and hysteresis behaviorsthat could cause oscillations and positioning errors. This studypresents a two-degree-of-freedom high-bandwidth control approach, where the inner-loop delayed position feedback controller,determined by a generalized Runge-Kutta method, is designedto suppress the vibration effect, and the outer-loop high-gain PIcontroller is adopted to improve the tracking performance in thepresence of hysteresis nonlinearity, disturbance and modelingerrors. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach isdemonstrated by experiments on a piezo-actuated nanopositioningstage. Due to the simple structure and ease of implementation, thedeveloped control approach can be applied to other piezo-actuatedsystems as well.
