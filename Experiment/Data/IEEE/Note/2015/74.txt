This paper was motivated by the problemof computing an optimal commonly agreeable temperatureset-point in spaces with multiple occupants. Consider office floorswith cubicles, conference rooms, student dorms, homes, andother multi-occupant spaces where temperature set-points onthermostats are chosen irrespective of the number of occupantsand their individual preferences. This existing approach is notonly non user-centric but also suboptimal from both energyconsumption and occupant satisfaction/productivity perspectives.It is thus highly desirable for such multi-occupant spaces tohave a mechanism that would take into account each occupant’sindividual comfort preference and the energy cost, to come upwith an optimal temperature set-point. Individual occupant’sfeedback and preference can be obtained through wearable sensors or smart phone applications. In this work, we propose an algorithm that takes into account each occupant’s preferencesalong with the thermal correlations between the different zonesin a building, to arrive at optimal temperature set-points for allthe zones of the building in a coordinated manner. This approachis therefore also more performance-efficient than controlling thetemperature set-point of each zone in the building in an isolatedmanner. We establish convergence of our algorithm and use theparameters of an experimental facility to simulate and evaluatethe proposed algorithm. The proposed solution can be deployedin multi-occupant spaces to make the occupants of the entirespace more comfortable, and simultaneously facilitate energyefficient operation of the space. The occupants can provide theirtemperature preference one time (or when it changes) using smartphone or desktop application or wearables, which is then utilizedto calculate the optimal temperature set-point of various zonesin real time. The optimal set-point would be updated in real timebased on change in occupancy and or occupant preference.
