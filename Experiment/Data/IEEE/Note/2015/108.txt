While life cycle assessment (LCA) is an essential component of modern eco-design practices, it is cost and resource intensive. We propose and develop a case-based reasoning (CBR) procedure that allows swift and accurate estimates of the ecological effects of a new product. The estimated ecological effects are within about 5% of the true ecological values for the new product. Such accuracy is obtained by having a relatively large database of existing products with LCA data and using an intermediate level of detail when describing the products. As such, the LCA via CBR is most applicable to products which are developed as modifications of existing ones (e.g., cell phones, automobiles). It is hoped that the proposed method can be extended to allow for LCA estimates at many levels of product detail.
