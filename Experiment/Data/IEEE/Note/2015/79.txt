Automatic morphological analysis ofcells under a microscope is important for biologists who studycellular function. Many laboratories still analyze large numbersof cells manually. Our proposed system can significantly improvethe efficiency of the statistical analysis of cells. Several thousandcell samples can be collected and analyzed in a short time (withinseveral minutes). Lab-on-a-chip practitioners can easily applythis technology to fast-flowing cells in microchannels, such as red blood cells, cancer cells, or iPS cells, which should be inspectedby checking size, contour, eccentricity, transparency, and otherimage-based parameters for statistical analysis and automatedmass production of good-quality cells.
