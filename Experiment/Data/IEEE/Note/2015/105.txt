Automatic Web service composition plays an increasingly important role in the rapid development of software applications to meet the fast-changing market needs. This work addresses the difficult and new issue of composing fuzzy semantic services based on user-supplied input and output requirements and behavioral constraints. Both Horn clause logic reasoning theory and fuzzy predicate Petri nets are used to develop polynomially complex algorithms for a desired composite service. A business service example is used to illustrate the proposed concepts and algorithms. The proposed methodology is readily applicable to industrial size Web service composition problems.
