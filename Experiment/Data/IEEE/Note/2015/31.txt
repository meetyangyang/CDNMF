It is possible to extend the capabilities ofa robot system by providing online services. An example of sucha service is an online library of robot applications, an app store,where robot programs can be downloaded and installed on thesystem with little effort from the user. Another is text analysis,that requires heavy computations but can provide a more naturaluser interaction. Experiences from several European projectswith the goal to simplify robot usage/programming have resultedin a number of insights around the core challenges. For instance,providing application libraries in a traditional software sense istoo limited when considering the necessary management of uncertainty (including human interaction, configuration of sensing,and learning). Robot programs are therefore better representedas distributable and compositional knowledge, together withsupporting computational services. Since robot programming istime consuming and requires expertise, thus expensive, there is aneed for good services that simplify this process. We see a needfor coherent APIs in existing robot programming tools such thatthe desired app store can be added to the back-end of existingsolutions.
