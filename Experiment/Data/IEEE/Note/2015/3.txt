This paper presents a software-automated method to design the time-varying control input for adynamic system when attempting to better estimate model parameters. This type of scenario could include an automated systemactively inspecting multibody parts for elastic or damping coefficients or a robot attempting to better estimate its own inertias.The method requires known equations of motion of a system withunknown, constant parameters. We show—both in simulation andin experiment—that using the algorithm to optimize the controlinput results in better convergence of parameter estimates forsimulated and experimental systems.
