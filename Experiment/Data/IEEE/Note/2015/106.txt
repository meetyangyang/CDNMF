There have been many studies on scheduling cluster tools, but most of them utilize different scheduling approaches or develop problem specialized properties. It is impractical to implement all the different methods to a tool scheduler because the scheduling requirements continuously change depending on wafer types and tool architectures. Hence, it is required to have an efficient solution method to address diverse cluster tool scheduling problems in fabs especially for frequent lot switchings and tool state changes due to larger wafer size and smaller lot order size. Therefore, we develop an efficient branch and bound procedure for noncyclic scheduling of a cluster tool with the makespan measurement. Since TPNs have the powerful modeling ability and analysis capability, the algorithm is developed based on a TPN. From the experimental results, we observe that one lot with 25 wafers can be easily solved in a reasonable time. The proposed method can be used for many different scheduling problems of a cluster tool by generating each corresponding TPN model.
