Highly constrained motion-planning scenarios, even of low degree of freedom, arise in various applicationssuch as assembly planning and manufacturing applications. Ourapproach, which emphasizes high precision over any known sampling-based technique that we are aware of, allows to cope withexactly such cases. For instance, we show that our framework canbe applied to tight scenarios that arise in three-handed assemblyplanning. The ability to cope with tight scenarios is possible, inpart, due to recent improvements in exact geometric software suchas the publicly available Computational Geometry AlgorithmsLibrary [43] (CGAL).
