MRS can be used to perform environmental monitoring;  exploration tasks;  and search and rescue missions. Accurate localization is a critical factor that governs the success of the autonomous mobile robots-based missions. In order to improve the localization accuracy;  robots can be equipped with advanced sensory systems which will increase the cost. Additionally;  robots can execute advanced localization algorithms to generate an accurate localization which entails higher processing capabilities and higher memory capacity. Most of the robotic systems do not possess sufficient resources to host advanced sensory systems and execute advanced localization algorithms. In a heterogeneousMRS;  robots with more accurate localization capabilities (leader robots) can assist robot with limited resources (child robots) for localization. Available leader-assistive localization approaches demand child robots to operate within the sensing range of the leader robots. This constraint limits the teammates' maneuverability;  reduces the area covered by the robots;  and demands a complex algorithm to avoid collisions among teammates. We address this limitation and propose a novel leader-assistive localization framework. The proposed framework is capable of establishing an accurate and consistent pose estimation for child robots even when they operate beyond the sensing range of leader robots.
