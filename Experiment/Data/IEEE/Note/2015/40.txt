Maintaining the stability of an assemblyas assembly or disassembly proceeds is critical during product assembly, repair, and maintenance. While fixtures can ensure stability, they add cost and restrict access for parts and tools. We showthat the stability of the assembly can depend on the paths taken bythe parts, and present an approach for selecting paths that ensurestability from among the geometrically feasible paths. The mainapplication is in assembly and disassembly planning for reducingthe fixturing requirements and in planning assembly motions thatdo not cause instability. The results will also be useful in designingdisassembly operations during maintenance or repair, when it maynot be possible to fixture all parts. The stability analysis can alsobe used by assistive robots in domestic environments for tasks like stacking objects and for safe removal of collapsed structures afterdisasters such as earthquakes.
