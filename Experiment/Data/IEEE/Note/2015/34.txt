This paper attempts to bring automationto field biologists. This is relatively new area as videos are oftencaptured under natural lightings by non-experts. Hence, new challenges arrive as the demand for analyzing these large amount ofvideo data increases. We propose a species detection algorithm forbirds by considering factors such as unknown camera intrinsicsand motion, variable lighting conditions, and different backgroundtypes. This algorithm have been tested with crowd sourced videodata with different species of birds. The results meet the designgoals and it proves that this algorithm can be an effective tool toassist ornithologists.
