There are many systems which repeat an identical task sequence such as manufacturing systems;  transportation systems;  and robotic systems. Maximizing the throughput of such a system by optimizing the cyclic task sequence;  which is called a cyclic scheduling problem;  has been an important problem. In order to deal with cyclic scheduling problems;  this paper uses a timed Petri net (TPN) which is a graphical modeling tool for discrete event dynamic systems. As the size of TPN model increases;  the computational complexity of the cyclic scheduling problem exponentially increases due to the combinatorial nature of sequencing problems. Therefore;  an efficient algorithm for optimal cyclic scheduling of TPNs is needed. This study proposes an efficient branch and bound algorithm which is kind of a tree search algorithm. Several important techniques are developed. First;  a transformation procedure from a TPN to timed event graph is developed. Second;  an efficient branching rule which reduces the size of the search tree is proposed. Third;  the lower bound which evaluates the cycle time of each node in the search tree is suggested. We verify the efficiency of the algorithm through the experiments on manufacturing systems such as a cluster tool and a robotic flow shop.
