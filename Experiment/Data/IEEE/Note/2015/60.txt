TPNs have been widely used for modeling;  analyzing;  and scheduling discrete-event dynamic systems. Many works have improved the performance of automated manufacturing systems by developing efficient mixed integer programming models;  branch and bound algorithms;  or specialized strategies with a TPN. The branch and bound procedures and many other scheduling methods for a TPN search solutions by exploring paths in the reachability tree because every possible sequence can be identified as a path in the tree. However;  the tree is so large even for a small Petri net. Hence;  we propose a reduced reachability tree called a time-feasible reachability tree by eliminating infeasible solutions in view of time evolution. We use the time-feasible reachability tree for a branch and bound procedure for solving a TPN;  and its effectiveness is verified with linear cluster tool scheduling problems. A dual-armed linear cluster tool with 25 wafers can be solved easily. We can extend the solvable problem ranges of many scheduling problems with this research.
