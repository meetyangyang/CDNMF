For single-arm cluster tools with wafer residency constraints;  this work proposes the response policies when a PM fails in wafer fabrication. With a Petri net model;  when there are feasible cyclic schedules for both before and after failure;  policies are presented to respond to a PM failure such that the wafers in a tool can be completed in a feasible way. The policies require polynomially complex calculation and can be implemented on-line to satisfy the real-time requirements. Therefore;  they are applicable to practical semiconductor manufacturing systems.
