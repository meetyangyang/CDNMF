The practical value of this work is the explicit derivation of recursive formulas for exact expressions for thefirst- and second-order linearizations of an arbitrary constrainedmechanical system without requiring symbolic calculations. Thisis most applicable to the design of computer-aided design (CAD)software, where providing linearization information and sensitivity analysis facilitates mechanism analysis (e.g., controllability,observability) as well as control design (e.g., design of locallystabilizing feedback laws).
