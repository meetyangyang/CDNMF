This paper presents an approach which enables a fleet of multirotor UAVs to follow a set of desired trajectories and coordinate along them;  thus satisfying specific spatial and temporal assignments. The proposed solution can be employed in applications in which multiple vehicles are tasked to execute cooperative;  collision-free maneuvers;  and accomplish a common goal in a safely manner. An example is sequential monitoring;  in which the UAVs have to visit and monitor a set of points of interest;  while maintaining a desired temporal separation between each other. In this paper;  we also simulate a scenario in which the vehicles;  positioned in a square room;  are required to exchange position with each other. It is shown that the proposed control algorithm not only ensures that the UAVs arrive at the final destinations at the same time;  but also guarantees safety;  i.e.;  the vehicles avoid collision with each other at all times.
