The research work presented in this paper is to support the procedure of customized design and manufacturing. As a very important preprocessing step for the industrial design of many applications;  the 3D shape of real objects must be scanned and reconstructed in computer systems. To assign semantic information to the reconstructed mesh surface;  the surface are segmented into meaningful components which;  however;  is not a well-defined problem. There is no general segmentation approach that has good performance for scanned models with freeform surfaces. According to the observation that models in many industrial applications (e.g.;  customized dental treatment) have meaningful components in the form of compact shape (e.g.;  teeth) separating from other regions (e.g.;  gum);  a segmentation method is developed in this paper by using the compact shape prior. The techniques developed here can speedup the design and manufacturing of devices for customized dental treatment (e.g.;  orthodontic braces).
