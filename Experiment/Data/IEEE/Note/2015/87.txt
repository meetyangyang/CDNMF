A wet station performs wafer cleaning processes for removing residual contaminants after a wafer fabrication process. The wafer cleaning process approximately accounts for 30% of the whole wafer fabrication process and is critical to wafer quality. A wet station consists of several cleaning and rinsing baths and several lot-handling robots, and processes multiple different jobs concurrently. The jobs often require reentrant flows and have strict time constraints while there is no intermediate buffer. Due to such high complexity, the utilization of the baths and the throughput rate tend to be very low. For example, fabs process only two or three jobs concurrently, while the number of baths is eight or more. We developed an efficient scheduling method that can solve practical scheduling problems for wet stations and increase the throughput and utilization rate more than twice. The whole solution procedure from Petri net modeling for a given tool configuration and job flow data to finding optimal robot task sequences and schedules can be automated.
