Analyzing their QoS plays an importantrole in understanding and improving the quality of cloud computing systems and cloud-based applications. However, it is a greatchallenge with their increasing scale and complexity. A carefulinvestigation into existing methods has found their limitationswhen applied to address the QoS analysis challenge: 1) incomplete modeling of details such as machine provisioning, requesthandling, and machine failure/repair process; 2) reliance on measurement-based QoS data that require extensive experimentationand real-system tests; and 3) separate modeling of provisioningphases which simplifies the solution but loses accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a comprehensive qualitydetermination framework for Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds.It features with: 1) taking machine provisioning, request handling,machine occupation/releasing, and machine failure/repair process mechanism into a unified analytical model; 2) employing queueingnetworks as the fundamental means of QoS analysis; 3) analyticalsolutions of three important QoS metrics; 4) analytical modelingof different strategies of machine warm-up/cool-down and theability to identify the optimal balance between system overheadand performance; and 5) a confidence interval analysis to validatemodel correctness based on simulative QoS data. The proposedframework can aid the design and optimization of industrialcloud computing systems and practitioners' understanding of QoSaspects of cloud-based applications.
