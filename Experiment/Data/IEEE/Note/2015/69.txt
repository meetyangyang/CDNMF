This paper is motivated by the problemof developing a smart home environment that is able to understand the behavior of an elderly person living in it. The long termgoal is to integrate intelligent home service robots into such smarthomes for elderly care. Through the use of wearable motion sensors and the associated contextual information, we proposed andimplemented a probabilistic framework for behavioral anomalydetection while avoiding the problems inherited in traditional vision-based anomaly detection approaches. The theoretical framework has been tested and evaluated in a simple laboratory environment as a proof of concept. Apparently, more realistic tests andthorough evaluation should be conducted for deployment in realhome environments, which is the goal of our next stage of research.It is also desired to reduce the size and weight of the wearable motion sensors and improve their user-friendliness.
