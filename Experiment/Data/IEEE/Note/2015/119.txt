As an alternative to traditional grinding;  hard turning is an attractive machining method;  in which surface quality is a crucial measurement index. However;  under the scenario of sample missing;  a straightforward and relatively accurate model for predicting surface roughness is challenging to establish using conventional strategies. This paper reports on a new HMM-SVM model based on Bayesian inference for modeling and predicting surface roughness in hard turning. The samples are classified based on the accuracy grade of surface roughness according to the GB/T1031-2009 standard using the expectation maximization algorithm and HMM;  which is superior in small-sample classification problem. LSSVM is employed to estimate surface roughness. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through experimental investigations. The reported methodology can also be extended to other related fields.
