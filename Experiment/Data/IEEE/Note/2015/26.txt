Cloud computing for robotics is verypromising for several reasons, like robot's energy saving, largerstorage capacity, stable electric power, better resource utilizationand the difficulty of upgrading the robots' embedded hardware.The presented application extracts 3D point clouds from the stereoimage pairs of a camera situated on the robot. Using these 3Dpoints, a shared control is implemented to help the remote teleoperation of a robot. That is, the commands sent by a joystick areattenuated when a possible collision is detected (by checking thefuture commanded trajectory against the 3D points). All of thesecomputationally heavy tasks (difficult to perform by a mobilerobot) are done in the cloud. The offloading models proposed inthis paper are generic enough to be used in other applications.Obtained results show that further improvement in communication technologies will suppose a significant performance boost foroffloading computation.
