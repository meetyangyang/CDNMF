This paper presents an architecture forcloud-based collaborative 3D mapping with low-cost robots. Thelow-cost robots used in this work consist mainly of a mobile base,a smart phone class processor, an RGB-D sensor, and a wirelessinterface. Each robot runs its own visual odometry algorithm,which estimates the pose of the robot using the color and thedepth frames (images) from the RGB-D sensor. The dense visualodometry algorithm presented herein uses no image features andrequires no specialized hardware. In addition to pose estimation,the visual odometry algorithm also produces key-frames, whichis a subset of frames that in a way summarizes the motion ofthe robot. These key-frames are sent to the cloud for furtheroptimization and merging with the key-frames produced by otherrobots. By sending only the key-frames (instead of all the framesproduced by the sensor), bandwidth requirements are significantlyreduced. Each robot is connected to the cloud infrastructureusing a WebSocket-based bidirectional full duplex communicationchannel. The cloud infrastructure is provided using Rapyuta,a Platform-as-a-Service framework for building scalable cloudrobotics applications. The key-frame pose optimization and themerging processes are parallelized in order to make them scalable.The updated key-frame poses are eventually sent back to the robotto improve its localization accuracy. In addition to describing thearchitecture and the design choices, the paper provides qualitativeand quantitative evaluations of the integrated system.
