In recent years, Find-and-Chat with nearby strangers has become a popular feature in mobile social applications. Different from making friends within acquaintance-based social circles, strangers often have no common friends and interaction histories. A unique challenge here is to recommend nearby interested strangers for users to chat. In fact, aside from the static user profiles such as head portrait, geographical area and limited photos, people's offline behaviors often reveal their real behavioral habits, preferences or interests. The more similar two strangers' check-in behaviors, the more likely they have common experiences or interests. We propose to use “Encounter” probability to measure the behavior similarity of two strangers according to their check-in histories. We define that two strangers encounter if and only if they check in at a same spot at the same time slice. The more frequently two strangers encounter, the more similar their check-in behaviors are. The proposed approach is validated through a real-world data set.
