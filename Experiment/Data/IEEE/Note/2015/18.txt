In the quality control practice, it shouldbe noted that many aggregated quality indicators or the pass/failconclusions are, in fact, drawn on the basis of complex measurements. Such measurements convey rich information about theprocess variability and quality patterns, and is therefore criticalto quality improvement.This work focuses on a scaling-up nano-manufacturing process.The quality of the product is characterized by a profile, whichcontains information about both the location and the flatness ofthe product. We design a statistical model to characterize productquality, then derive a control algorithm to improve the flatnessby adjusting controllable process variables. Such data-drivenmodeling and control framework is critical to study processes withcomplex quality metrics and large uncertainties.
