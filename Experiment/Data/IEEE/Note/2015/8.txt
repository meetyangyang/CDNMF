This paper was inspired by the problem ofusing a sensor with low-dimensional output, such as a range sensor,to determine the shape of an object, which is typically too complexfor a single measurement to characterize. Existing approaches toshape measurement generally use sensors with high-dimensionaloutput, such as cameras, or use low-dimensional sensors to measure fixed points, such as with Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM).It is shown here that by employing an algorithm that uses the results of previous measurements to determine how the next measurement is taken, a non-directional range sensor can be used toefficiently and exactly determine the shape of a convex polygon.This suggests an alternative approach to obtaining information onthe shape of an object in cases where low-dimensional sensors aremore accurate, faster, or cheaper than their counterparts.
