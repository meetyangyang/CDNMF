In clustered photolithography tools (CPTs) in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, wafers are commonly admitted to the tool as soon as the wafer handling robot can receive one. While this is done to ensure maximum throughput, it can result in long wafer residency in the tool and a reduction in the ability to promptly serve arriving hot lots. Here, we develop a computationally tractable and practical linear programming based method to obtain more judicious wafer admission times. Detailed simulation studies of models of real CPTs demonstrate no loss of throughput and a 52%, 31%, and 23% improvement in wafer time in the tool, lot time in the tool and hot lot cycle time, respectively. The results are robust; when the CPT exhibits behaviors significantly different than assumed in the controller, the release policy continues to perform well. As such, the method may prove useful in practical contexts to reduce wafer residency time and increase CPT agility.
