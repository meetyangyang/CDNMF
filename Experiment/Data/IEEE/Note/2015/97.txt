Welding is the final stage for manufacturing of many high value added products. While industrial welding robots have been in use for several decades, they are preprogrammed actuators with limited, if any, intelligence. Given that manufacturing is moving towards more customized production, next generation welding robots that can intelligently adjust to various welding tasks are urgently needed. Unfortunately, equipping robots with intelligence is challenging. This paper establishes a method to rapidly transform human welder intelligence into welding robots by using 3D weld pool surface as information source, fitting human welder response to the information by a neuro-fuzzy model, and using the neuro-fuzzy model as a replacement of human welder intelligence in automated GTAW systems. A foundation is thus established to mechanize the human welderâ€™s intelligence and develop next generation welding robots.
