A system of multiple mobile robots hasbeen shown to be a powerful method to accomplish complicatedtasks without using sophisticated robotic systems. Although a network of robots can fulfill missions that cannot be performed byindividual robots separately, in the absence of human input, mostmultirobot systems lack the flexibility to accomplish other thanpredefined tasks. Enduing multirobot systems with the intelligenceof a human being has been foreseen as a key technique for enhancing the performance and efficiency of automated robotic systems. This topic in the paper was inspired by the practical problems of multirobot cooperation in a hazardous environment andcooperative transportation in the manufacturing industry. To address some of the prime issues in question, we directed our effortsto develop a human-in-the-loop system that can provide multiplerobotic systems with the ability to handle a rapidly changing environment, through autonomous cooperation and position regulationin real time. This research is expected to make significant contributions in mobile sensor and actuator networks for automation, aswell as increase the autonomy and motion flexibility in micromanipulation, outer-space construction, and unknown areas of exploration in the near future.
