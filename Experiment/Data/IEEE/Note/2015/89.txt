 This method of visual control is motivated by the current state-of-the-art in display manufacturing. Traditional solutions for the manufacturing of displays assumes that the transformation between production head and control reference (e.g., kinematic or dynamic model) is known with high accuracy and that the display itself is rigid (i.e., fixed pitch between pixel centers). For flexible displays, this latter assumption is not the case. A method is proposed that takes these issues into account. A camera measures directly where the center of each display cell is located and generates online a trajectory for velocity motion control. This velocity reference is based on a smooth profile with a fixed velocity on cell centers and a higher velocity in between cell centers. This enables a higher overall velocity while ensuring a similar quality of printing compared to a constant velocity reference. Visual control and trajectory generation is executed at 1600 [Hz] with an image size of 160 100 pixels. Feedback is obtained only from visual input, the encoders present in the motors are not used.
