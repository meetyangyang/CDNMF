Multivariate modeling is of great significance to multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) industrial processes. Compared to the modeling of single-input–single- output (SISO) systems, multivariate modeling usually demands an additional step that is to identify the existence of directional links. This is because the inputs and outputs in complex processes are often undistinguishable beforehand. Motivated by this problem, a new approach based on interleave data vector construction is proposed for simultaneous determination of bidirectional path models (causality). The proposed approach possesses a simple and compact structure for implementation and interpretation in practical applications. It is especially useful for the cases when the model structure is not known a priori or changes with time.
