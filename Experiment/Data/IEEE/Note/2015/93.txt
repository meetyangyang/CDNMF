Switched systems are widely used for modeling complex systems, such as power electronics and network control systems, since they can complicatedly describe the interactions of a family of continuous-time or discrete-time dynamical systems. In practical systems, obtaining an accurate knowledge of the state is a crucial task that can determine the feasibility and reliability of subsequent activities as control. Usually, building a dynamical system called an “observer” to estimate the actual state is more applicable since some state variables cannot be measured through sensors. It is reasonable to design a multiple-mode observer for switched systems by designing a collection of observers for each mode of the switched system. If the active mode of the switched system is known, it is only to activate the corresponding mode of the observer. However, there is no guarantee that the estimation error will converge using this approach, even if the estimation error converges for each mode. Therefore, in this paper, the ADT switching is designed to guarantee that the estimation error converges. Furthermore, in practice, it actually takes time to identify the system modes and apply the matched observer, which implies that the switching of the observers is asynchronous with that of the plants. In this case, the previously designed observer will fail to estimate the actual state. Thus, efficient design methods for the ADT switching and the delayed observers will also be developed to complete the estimation task.
