In manufacturing, small variations inpart shape are inevitable. This paper addresses the challenge ofgrasping parts with a parallel-jaw gripper where the true partshape is modeled with statistical tolerancing. We use samplingto compute the grasp position and orientation that optimizes theprobability of achieving a stable grasp. The computation requiresmany samples but can be parallelized and performed efficientlyusing Cloud computing. We present algorithms and experimentsusing PiCloud, a commercial cloud computing platform. In futurework, we hope to extend the 2-D linear analysis to 3-D parts withcurved surfaces.
