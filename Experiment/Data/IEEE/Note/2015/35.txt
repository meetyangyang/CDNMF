This work was motivated by the supervisory control need for a campus central plant. Plant operatorshave to decide a scheduling strategy to mix and match variouschillers with a thermal energy storage to satisfy the campuscooling demands, while minimizing the operation cost. This work mathematically characterizes the system dynamics of a campuscentral plant and establishes a linear model to predict campuscooling load. It proposes a model predictive control (MPC)strategy to optimally schedule the campus central plant basedon plant system dynamics and predicted campus cooling load. Aheuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain suboptimal solutionsfor the MPC problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of theproposed approach are well demonstrated for the central plant atthe University of California, Irvine.
