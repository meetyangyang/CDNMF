RoboEarth is a cloud-based knowledgebase for robots that transforms a simple robot into an intelligent one thanks to the web services provided. As mapping is amandatory element on most of the robot systems, we focus onthe RoboEarth semantic mapping for robot systems, showing thebenefits of the combination of SLAM (Simultaneous LocalizationAnd Map building), and knowledge-based reasoning. We showthe qualities of our system by means of two experiments: 1)building a map of a novel environment boosted by prior information and 2) efficient searching for a novel object thanks to theknowledge-based reasoning techniques. We can conclude thatRoboEarth enables the execution of the proposed methods as weband cloud services that enable advanced perception in a simplerobot.
