This work presents a viable approach tooptimizing delivery routes for a coordinated team consisting of asmall aerial vehicle and a large ground vehicle. The large groundvehicle provides long-range transport and support while the smallaerial vehicle completes the final leg of each delivery, thereby reducing overall delivery time and fuel consumption. The approachexploits well known methods from algorithmic graph theory, to efficiently identify route savings that can be achieved with the teamover conventional single truck delivery. Results are presented formultiple city environments, with clear improvements in deliverytime and total distance travelled observed.
