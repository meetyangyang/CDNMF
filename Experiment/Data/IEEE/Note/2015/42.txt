This paper was motivated by the problem of tracking ground objects of interest using multiple cooperative autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing approaches to cooperative target tracking are designed for homogeneous vehicles and neglect geometrical constraints of the multiview target tracking problem. The methodology proposed in this work incorporates heterogenous robots to cooperatively track a ground object of interest. To improve the accuracy of target localization;  the epipolar geometry between multirobot views is utilized to formulate mathematical constraints. In this paper;  it is analytically proved that the imposing the proposed constraints improves target localization accuracy. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the benefits in target localization accuracy using the proposed method.
