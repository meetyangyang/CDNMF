The problem dealt with in this paper is the coordinated motion of a group of mobile robots. Without a leader or a central authority;  the members of the team attempt to converge into a predefined formation by exchanging information about position and velocities among themselves. The particularity here is that the communication among agents is corrupted by two time delays. One delay is considered to affect the measurement of the position of the agents and the second the determination of their velocity. We present a methodology to study the effect of the delay in the stability of the formation. This technique allows an exact declaration of the delay compositions that guarantee convergence to the formation in a finite time. The methodology is applied to a group of nonholonomic differential drive mobile robots.
