 The scheduling of dual-armed cluster tools has been attracted by many researchers recently with growing semiconductor manufacturing. Most of the conventional studies have been concentrated on cyclic scheduling to minimize the cycle time with the swap strategy for robot arm operations. The swap strategy has been widely used to analyze the steady-state operation with cyclic schedules in order to simplify the model with less computational complexity. However, dual-armed cluster tool operations for the swap strategy are restricted because possible states are limited. Non-swap strategy outperforms the swap strategy in the transport-bound region. In order to deal with lot switching, frequent wafer flow pattern changes, periodic maintenance, and processing time variations, a deadlock-free and non-cyclic scheduling without swap strategy is highly required. In this paper, we propose a Petri net decomposition approach with a deadlock avoidance policy that can derive a near-optimal solution for much larger size of non-cyclic scheduling problems of dual-armed cluster tools. A timed Petri net model for non-cyclic scheduling is developed for the dual-armed cluster tools with different flow pattern without assuming the swap strategy. Deadlock is analyzed with minimal siphons of the proposed model and the deadlock-free conditions are derived. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of the non-cyclic scheduling solution derived by the proposed method for multiple wafer flow patterns.
