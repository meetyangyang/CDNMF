An idealization is made in the vast majority of the task allocation literature: the presumption of taskindependence. Tasks are never performed in perfect isolation inpractice and this paper shows that computing task costs independently, although a prevalent modeling simplification, may bedetrimental. Whenever robots use shared resources (e.g., narrowpassages, limited communication bandwidth), resource contentionand physical interference may cause performance to degrade.These aspects can be thought of as interrelationships betweentasks costs and this article introduces an augmented model thatexpresses such interrelationships by capturing resource-basedinteractions among robots which change task execution costs. Thispaper describes optimization methods which allowing differentmodels of contention (e.g., linear or convex) giving the practitionerflexibility for their specific application. Generally, the algorithmsdescribed are fast enough to be applied to real-time applications, but the experimental data also enable an understanding of modeling complexity versus running-time.
