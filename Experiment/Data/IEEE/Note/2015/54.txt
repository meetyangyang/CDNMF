This paper was motivated by the need to enhance the robustness of CP-DGPS/INS relative navigation. In particular;  small UAVs exhibit fast dynamics and are often subjected to large and quickly changing bank angles. This in turn induces missed satellite observations and changes in the phase ambiguity. This paper suggests leveraging the emergence of Ultra Wideband ranging radios to directly observe the baseline separation. In this paper;  we outline the details of the algorithm implementation. We then use a simulation to show that adding UWB greatly helps to enhance the robustness of the carrier ambiguity integer-resolving algorithm;  which is necessary for improved solution accuracy. This work has extensions to ground vehicles;  ocean buoys;  and space vehicles. In future work;  we will experimentally validate results.
