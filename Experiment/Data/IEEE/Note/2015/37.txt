Because of the line-of-sight requirementof the optical tracking systems, surgeons have to constantly keepnothing blocking between cameras and instruments, and carefullyadjust their instruments in order to obtain tracked data. Thisproblem is cumbersome and time consuming that exists in the operating room for a long time, nevertheless, no satisfactory solutionhas been given yet. Hence, in this paper, we propose a reconfigurable modular system to solve this problem. First, the proposedsystem uses multiple monocular client modules that each of themcan carry out instrument tracking independently. Then, instead of fixing all the modules to a static configuration, every clientmodule can be moved manually by a surgeon or automaticallyby a controller when occlusion happens. As a corner stone of thisdesign, an agile and fast multicamera calibration method whichcan find the rotational and translational relation among all themonocular modules after the system reconfiguration, is definitelyrequired. Existing approaches are not suitable for the surgicalpractice, since they have to use extra chessboard or an point lightin a dark environment. Furthermore, the iterative algorithm usedin these approaches is time consuming and initial value dependent.
