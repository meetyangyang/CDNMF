To this aim, both municipal managers andprivate administrators aim at optimizing the building power consumptions. The presented district energy management approachcan be applied in the real world for two purposes: 1) energy wastesand costs are minimized with economic advantages for users, citizens, and public administrations and 2) the power consumptionis reduced by providing environmental and social benefits.
