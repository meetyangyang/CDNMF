In an RFID system, packet collisions can occur when multiple tags transmit a reply message simultaneously in response to a query from the reader. To cope with the collision issue in RFID systems, the EPC Gen-2 standard recommends the dynamic framed slotted ALOHA technique for tag identification purpose. Most of the RFID systems that are currently in use by industry have been designed and implemented based on the EPC Gen-2 standard. Recently, some researchers have suggested to replace the current dynamic framed slotted ALOHA technique used in the EPC Gen-2 protocol with the CDMA technique to allow more tags to be read at each query and to expedite the tag identification procedure. The time needed to identify all tags in the system and the required bandwidth play an important role in designing a commercial or industrial RFID system. Therefore, before adapting the CDMA technique in new RFID systems, it is necessary to know the pros and cons of using this technique for the tag identification purpose, and to compare its performance with the standard EPC Gen-2 protocol. In this paper, the efficiency of the EPC Gen-2 and the CDMA-based protocols in identifying the nearby tags are evaluated and compared, and it is shown that the standard EPC Gen-2 protocol outperforms the CDMA-based technique in terms of the number of transmitted bits and the time needed to successfully identify all tags in the system. The analytical models proposed in this paper are also useful for engineers and developers to implement and optimize the EPC Gen-2 and the CDMA-based tag identification protocols.
