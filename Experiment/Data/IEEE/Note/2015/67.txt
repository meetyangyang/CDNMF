This work follows current trends in homeautomation and is motivated by the ever-growing opportunities ofcontrolling the appliances and interacting with the daily environment, offered by the proliferation of powerful consumer devices,such as tablets, smartphones, and wearables. In such a scenario,gesture recognition (GR) interfaces based on acceleration measurements are quite attractive, but there is the need of providing a flexible approach that guarantees accuracy and robustness in understanding the input gestures, while avoiding at the same time tiringand tedious setup and tuning phases. In this paper, a smart procedure is proposed that takes into account the different phases of theGR algorithm and offers a modular scheme where issues relatedto the compactness of the gesture representation and the computational cost are considered together with the classification accuracy performance: In practice, this poses a tradeoff between parsimonyand accuracy that can be solved only with respect to the specificapplication of interest. Most remarkably, the designed solution isin any case characterized by being independent on the user, on thedevice, and on the gesture execution. The evaluation of the methodology is carried out with respect to a large real scenario datasetthat has involved more than 30 people and confirms the validity ofthe approach and a classification accuracy always over 90% thatbecomes close to 100% with suitable choices. In addition, the confusion matrix that details how each gesture is classified with respect to the others is proposed as a tool to assess the risk of thegesture-command assignment.
