This paper shows how simple mechanisms, requiring only very limited actuation, and no sensing, canbe designed that allow knots to be tied automatically in string orrope in two steps. In the first phase of knot tying, the string isloosely arranged into the shape of the knot using pressurized air.In the second phase, the ends of the string are pulled to tightenthe knot in a controlled fashion, guided by the geometric structureof the mechanism. Although these devices are intended as a proofof concept, the automatic design process can design these mechanisms for a broad family of knots, and experimental work showsthat simple knots can be arranged and tightened in a few seconds.
