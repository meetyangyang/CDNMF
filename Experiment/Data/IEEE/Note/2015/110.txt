This paper is motivated by the problem of evacuating people from indoor to outdoor environments. Existing models study the behavior of the evacuating crowd either in a microscopic or a macroscopic way and provide means for actuation on the evacuees by sound or visual signals, to avoid clogging at certain exits. This paper suggests a novel approach using a mobile robot to attract the attention of evacuees heading towards saturated exits and guide them to less blocked ones, thus ensuring a faster and safer area clearance, reducing the bottleneck effect usually observed in front of the exits. Comparative studies prove the efficiency of the proposed method which can improve the overall evacuation saving crucial response time in the emergency situations. In future research, we will address the problem of coordinating multiple robots for the evacuation of masses in big auditoriums or stadiums.
