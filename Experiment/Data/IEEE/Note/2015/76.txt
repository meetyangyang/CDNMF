Operating low-cost robots in large groupsis becoming a widespread practice. Planning the motion of a groupof robots among obstacles is known to be computationally hard. Inparticular, the worst-case running time of such algorithms growsexponentially in the number of robots. We present a very efficientalgorithm for planning collision-free paths for a special case: a setof interchangeable disc (Roomba-like) robots moving in a simplepolygon environment. By interchangeable we mean that we do notcare which robot reaches a specific target position, as long as alltarget positions are occupied at the end of the motion. Our technique is complete and as such it is guaranteed to find a solution ifone exists, or report that none exist otherwise. To obtain the efficient solution, we assume a certain minimum separation betweenthe robots in their initial and target positionsâ€”we believe that thisis the crucial assumption needed to obtain an efficient solution.
