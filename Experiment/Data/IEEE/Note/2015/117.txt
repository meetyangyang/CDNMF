Nowadays;  networks and computers make the collection;  storage and dissemination of information much easier. This brings us a lot of convenience;  but at the same time;  also brings us the worry that some private information may be released to the public undesirably. The problem of how to control the release of information thus becomes very important. In this paper;  we propose a discrete-event-system approach to investigate the information release problem. The solution can ensure the opacity of private information while releasing the maximum information to the public. We believe that the practitioners both in the field of system and control and in the field of information science will benefit from the results.
