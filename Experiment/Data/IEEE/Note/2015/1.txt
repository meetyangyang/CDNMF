Industrial robots traditionally are preprogrammed with teach pendants to perform simple repetitive taskswithout any sensor feedback. This work was motivated by demonstrating that industrial robots can also perform advanced, sensorbased tasks such as visual servoing, force-feedback control, andteleoperation. Industrial robots are typically limited by the longdelay between command and action, but with careful tuning, weshow that these sensor-based methods are still feasible even withoff-the-shelf sensors.The specific experimental testbed involves a 15 degree-offreedom dual-arm industrial robot with each wrist outfitted witha camera, a rubber contact pad, and a force/torque sensor. AMicrosoft Kinect is used to communicate operator commandsthrough gesture. The integrated system involves seven processesrunning on three computers (2 running Windows 7, 1 runningWindows XP) connected through a local hub using the TCP/IPprotocol. The communication between the components is basedon an object-oriented distributed control and communicationsoftware architecture called Robot Raconteur.Though the implementation is for our specific testbed, the approach is sufficiently general to be extended to other robots, endeffectors, sensors, and operating systems.
