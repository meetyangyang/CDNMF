The proposed method can be applied to the grasping of 3D polyhedron-like workpieces with a binary industry gripper;  for which the user needs only to know a rough placement of the gripper;  and the contact model between the pins and the workpieces is unnecessary. Moreover;  we can find the initial caging configuration using just one single image. Several experiments witness the validity of our method.
