The problem of planning work releasesinto large production facilities made up of resources subject toqueueing behavior is pervasive in many industries, notably insemiconductor wafer fabrication. Most current planning methodsfail to recognize the nonlinear relationship between workloadand cycle times imposed by queueing behavior. We present anoptimization model for planning work releases into such facilitiesusing nonlinear CFs. We estimate the parameters of the CFs usingsimulation optimization, and show that the resulting functionsyield significantly better plant performance than prior methods,which have been shown to perform better than the linear programming models that are the current state-of-the-art.
