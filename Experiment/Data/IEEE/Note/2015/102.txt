This paper was motivated by rapidness requirement of the initial alignment, a crucial stage for the widely used strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). The rapidness of the initial alignment is critical for the carrierâ€™s maneuverability while the accuracy of the initial alignment has a direct impact on the following navigation operation. Therefore, it is desired to achieve high accuracy in short time for the initial alignment. However, the initial alignment speed and accuracy are two aspects of a contradiction and need to compromise with each other. Aided by the powerful navigation computer technology, the backward navigation can reprocess a long segment of recorded data using very short time. With this consideration, the concept of backward navigation is investigated to accelerate the newly developed attitude determination-based initial alignment. A novel backtracking scheme is proposed to derive the backward data which is used to construct the vector observations for the attitude determination-based initial alignment. Due to the special integration procedure used in the vector observations construction, the measurements of the inertial sensors can be used more efficiently, resulting in a much improved performance with only a little more time cost. To this respect, the contradiction of the initial alignment speed and accuracy can be counteracted to a certain extent by the investigated method. The method investigated in this paper has been successfully used in our self-made on-ship SINS.
