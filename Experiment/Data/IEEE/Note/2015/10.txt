Automatic diagnosis of obstructive sleepapnea based on physiological signals is critical for healthcareservice improvement. Equal-length segmentation of signals isadopted in current OSA diagnosis, in which each segment ofsignal requires inferences from physicians to determine the apneaevents. However, this equal-length segmentation may bring possible misdetected apnea events, and finally lead to an incorrectdiagnosis. This paper aims to reduce the number of misdetectedapnea events by proposing an automatic segmentation rule withconsideration of reasonable physiological interpretation. An OSAseverity index which can be obtained from signal segments ofeach subject is designed. An SVM is employed to implement thefinal diagnosis. To fully implement this approach, it is necessary(i) to preprocess the RR intervals and eliminate unexpected signalpoints; (ii) to embed individual information of OSA suspects intoan SVM. A real world case study has shown that the proposeddiagnosis approach provided a satisfactory diagnosis accuracy.
