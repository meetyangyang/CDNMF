This study addresses new challenges in the real-time industrial systems by proposing original solutions for their low-power reconfiguration. This contribution is significant for future generations of low-power technology. A runtime event-based reconfiguration scenario is technically defined as any operation that works by adding/removing tasks. An agent-based architecture is developed, where an intelligent software agent is implemented to check the system’s runtime evolution. The agent presents useful technical solutions to reconfigure the system in order to meet the temporal constraints of the tasks and satisfy the system’s low-power consumption. It can also be deployed in reconfigurable real-time embedded systems such as lap-tops, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants.
