Many practical applications can be modeled as uncertain high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems;  whose node' controlling effects are state-dependent. In most relevant literatures;  however;  it is often assumed that each node' controlling effects are equal to one. How to cooperative control for the systems has become one main focus of control researches. Therefore;  in this paper;  an adaptive cooperative control scheme is proposed for such multi-agent systems. Finally;  the effectiveness of the control strategies is illustrated via simulation study.
