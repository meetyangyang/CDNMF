This paper was motivated by the question,“how decisions can be made regarding multiple functions existingin the manufacturing system in a unified manner.” Specifically, wefocus on three subsystems in the manufacturing system: production scheduling, maintenance scheduling, and machine capacitycontrol, which are usually handled in isolation or partially coupled manner due to high complexity of integrated decision making.Needs of such integrated decision making can be observed in a variety of manufacturing systems such as metal cutting and laserbased free forming production systems in which production efficiency, timeliness, and operating cost are all important. This papersuggests a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling interrelated dynamics of these systems and a dynamic algorithm to determine integrated solution. Computational experiments show thatthe proposed algorithm is within 10% ~ 20% from the optimum,but has a much faster convergence rate. Simulation results alsoindicate that increasing flexibility of production and maintenanceevents improves timely completion of these tasks.
