This paper was motivated by the will ofproviding a model of the behavior of the inhabitant at home, fromwhich formal methods can be applied to verify some properties,namely detect behavior deviations. The input of the framework isa log file of binary sensor events (rising and falling edges); a prefiltering of the log might be required to get rid of repetitive, noisyevents (namely, spurious events generated by motion sensors, forwhich only the first rising edge and last falling edges are relevant).This recorded log is assumed to be recorded without sensor faults,and to be characteristic of a typical routine of the inhabitant. Inorder to build this model, based on the Extended Finite Automata(EFA) formalism, sequence mining techniques (first contributionof the article) are adapted: the more frequent the sequence is, themore important for the inhabitant the habit is. The second contribution of the paper is the ability to detect behavior deviations,which is critical for healthcare at home and disease management.The technique of “residuals,” mainly used in manufacturing, hasbeen adapted to EFAs. It requires medical requirements, definedby the medical staff, based on the activities it wants to keep an eyeon. A suiting log of sensors events and medical requirements arethe only prerequisite to the application of the method.
