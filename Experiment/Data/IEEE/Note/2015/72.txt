In a rehabilitation or assistive robot, itis a vital problem to estimate the wearer's motion intention sinceany assistive robot should move in agreement with the wearerâ€™sintention. Considering the deficiencies of using physiological signals such as EEG and EMG, a human-robot interface is proposedbased on the use of force-sensing resister (FSR). The human motion intention is described by a quantitative model and can be estimated using filtering technologies. The estimated intention of thewearer can be used as a control input to guide the robot motion.The human-robot interface has a simple structure and is easy todon/doff. By using the proposed interface, the intention estimationand the intention-based control algorithms, an exoskeleton-type rehabilitation or assistive robot can be better controlled to make theuser feel natural and comfortable.
