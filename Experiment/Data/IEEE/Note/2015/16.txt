Motivated by the desire to enable robotsto autonomously operate in cluttered home and workplace environments, this paper presents an approach for intuitively traininga robot in a manner that enables it to repeat the task in novelscenarios and in the presence of unforeseen obstacles in the environment. Based on user-provided demonstrations of the task,our method learns features of the task that are consistent acrossthe demonstrations and that we expect should be repeated bythe robot when performing the task. We next present an efficientalgorithm for planning robot motions to perform the task basedon the learned features, while avoiding obstacles. We demonstratethe effectiveness of our motion planner for scenarios requiringtransferring a powder and pushing a button in environments withobstacles, and we plan to extend our results to more complex tasksin the future.
