The problem of fitting the largest number of nonoverlapping triangles of an isometric triangular grid in the interior of a simple polygon is very useful, e.g., for computing how to cover the skin of a robot with triangular electronic sensors. We show that the information of the number of triangles that are contained in the interior of a polygon in a given placement can be obtained efficiently by our proposed algorithm. This is a significant improvement over the algorithm provided in Anghinolfi et al., 2013. Furthermore, each connected set of contained triangles can be reported in time linear to the size of the set. Our proposed algorithm is simple and practical, and it can be adapted to efficiently compute the number of cells that are contained in a grid with a tiling of regular polygons.
