This work presents a robust environmental sound recognition system for home automation. Accordingto the classification results, automated services can be operated inthe home. To achieve this goal, the waveform of the detected soundis fed into the proposed sound recognition system, which includesa noise suppression module and a sound classification module. Inthe former, the characteristics of the noise are used to calculatethe gain of the estimator. In the latter, the waveform of the inputsignal is segmented into several frames for the sake of extractingframe-based acoustic features.
