Classically, the status of some process iscontrolled by means of physical measurements, which are only performed within certain intervals of time. In this way, there mightbe delays in the detection of process abnormalities. Moreover, theclassical measurement rules are typically of a statical nature (i.e.,the measurement policy is not adapted to current production conditions). In this paper, we propose a new sampling design basedon virtual measurements, which are predictions on the location ofthe real measurements in the control chart depending on the statusof the equipment while processing. With the availability of virtualmeasurements for every wafer, the status of the process can besteadily controlled and process deviations can be realized earlier.Moreover, the usage of virtual measurements allows for adaptingthe measurement policy to current process conditions. Wheneverprocess abnormalities are signalized by the virtual measurement,a physical measurement needs to be triggered. Therefore, physicalmetrology operations can be scheduled in a more efficient way.
