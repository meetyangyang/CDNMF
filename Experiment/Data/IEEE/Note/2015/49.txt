This paper is inspired by the source seeking problem in which the signal emitted from the source is assumed to be very noisy;  and the spatial distribution is assumed to be non-smooth. We focus our work specifically on electromagnetic sources. However;  the strategies proposed in this paper are also applicable to other kinds of sources;  for example;  nuclear;  radiological;  chemical or biological. We develop a planner for a swarm of mobile agents that try to locate an unknown electromagnetic source. The mobile agents know their own positions and can measure the signal strength at their current location. They can share information among themselves;  and plan for the next step. We propose a complete solution to ensure the effectiveness of PSO in complex environments where collisions may occur. We incorporate static and dynamic obstacle avoidance strategies in PSO to make it fully applicable to real-world scenario. We validate the proposed technique on an experimental testbed. As a part of our future work;  we will extend the technique to locate multiple sources of different kinds.
