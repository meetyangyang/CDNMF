- This paper suggests a new approach for designing BMI systems that incorporate learning capabilities and error perception feedback in order to gradually become autonomous. This approach consists in learning the relationship between sensing data from the environment-brain and user actions when controlling robotic devices. After the system is trained;  can predict control commands on behalf of the user under similar conditions. If the system makes a mistake;  user's error perception feedback is considered to improve the learning performance the system. In this paper;  we describe the methodologies to design and build hardware and software interfaces;  acquire and process brain signals;  and train the system using machine learning techniques. We then provide experimental evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach to design BMI systems that gradually become autonomous.
