This paper was motivated by the problemof simulating scheduling algorithms in Cloud data centers to evaluate their performance for different metrics. Existing tools suchas CloudSim [4] and CloudAnalyst [13], are based on SimJava [8]and GridSim [3], which treat a Cloud data center as a large resource pool and consider only application-level workloads, may notbe suitable for IaaS simulation where each VM as a resource is requested and allocated. There is still lack of tools that enable developers to evaluate requirements of large-scale Cloud applicationsin terms of comparing different resource scheduling algorithmsregarding geographic distribution of both computing servers anduser workloads. To fill this gap in tools for evaluation and modeling of Cloud environments and applications, in this paper wepropose CloudSched, for dynamic resource scheduling in Clouddatacenter. Real-time constraint of both VMs and PMs, which isoften neglected in literature, is considered in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are: proposing a simulation system formodeling Cloud computing environments and performance evaluation of different resource scheduling policies and algorithms;focusing on simulation of scheduling in IaaS layer where relatedtools are still lack; designing and implementing a lightweight simulator combining real-time multidimensional resource information.CloudSched offers the following novel features: (i) modeling andsimulation of large scale Cloud computing environments, includingdata centers, VMs and physical machines; (ii) providing a platformfor modeling different resource scheduling policies and algorithmsat IaaS layer for Clouds; and (iii) both graphical and textual outputs are supported.
