The motivation of this work grows from the need to increase the flexibility and efficiency of current multi-AGV systems. In particular;  in the current state-of-the-art the AGVs are guided through a manually defined roadmap with ad-hoc strategies for coordination. This is translated into high setup time requested for installation and the impossibility to easily respond to dynamic changes of the environment. The proposed method aims at managing all the design;  setup and control process in an automatic manner;  decreasing the time for setup and installation. The flexibility is also increased by considering a coordination strategy for the fleet of AGVs not based on manual ad-hoc rules. Simulations are performed in order to compare the proposed approach to the current industrial one. In the future;  industrial aspects;  as the warehouse management system;  will be integrated in order to achieve a real and complete industrial functionality.
