Rapid response system has been created and deployed in many hospitals to quickly evaluate, triage and treat deteriorating patients to improve patient safety and care quality. The response time performance (RTP) characterizes the efficacy of rapid response operations. RTP is defined as the probability that an appropriate decision in response to patient deterioration can be made within a desired time period. Since such decision time is directly related to patient safety, a system with high RTP is preferable. In this paper, we introduce a system-theoretic method to quantify RTP. An analytical formula is developed to calculate RTP under exponential response time assumption, and an approximation formula based on aggregation is also proposed. Monotonicity properties have been investigated, which can provide directions for RTP improvement. In addition, to identify the most critical response that can lead to the largest improvement in RTP, a bottleneck response indicator has been presented. Moreover, extensions to the case of non-exponential response time have been studied by proposing an approximation formula to calculate RTP. Finally, we apply the developed method at the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital to demonstrate its applicability. These results provide a quantitative tool for hospital management to evaluate and improve the efficiency of rapid response operations in acute care delivery.
