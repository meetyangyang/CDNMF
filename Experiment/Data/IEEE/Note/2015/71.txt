With the rise of the Internet of Things(IoT) as a major new force in the industry and the emergence ofnew consumer products and services especially smart home/smartspaces, tools are direly needed to understand how humans interactwith the technology. We present a simulation tool called Persim 3Dwhich helps researchers and practitioners create datasets for suchhuman-IoT interactions. Such datasets are very scarce and are critically needed to better design and validate new products and services. Persim 3D can be used by practitioners to rapidly prototypesmart spaces virtually and to achieve preliminary designs that can be evaluated, changed, and reevaluated, without bearing the costof real deployments
