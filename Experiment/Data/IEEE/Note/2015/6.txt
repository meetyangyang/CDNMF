Flow line models can be used to modelmanufacturing systems such as automobile production and assembly lines. In semiconductor manufacturing, they have shownpromise as equipment models for clustered photolithography tools(CPTs), in which the semiconductor wafers typically receive service from the toolâ€™s process modules in sequential order. In CPTs,an internal wafer buffer is often used to maximize throughput inthe presence of random variations in production events or setups.The larger buffer allows the CPT to produce wafers at a greaterthroughput rate. However, the quality of the wafers may degrade;process restrictions often require wafers to advance promptlyfrom one process to the next. The results developed in this papercan enable the exact calculation of the distribution of time a waferresides in each module. These probabilities not only enable us tounderstand such manufacturing systems but can be exploited toassess the tradeoff between an internal wafer buffer and delays ina CPT.
