This work concerns the uncertaintyinvolved in facility location allocation (FLA). To deal with suchuncertainty, it proposes a novel stochastic tradeoff method to solvean FLA problem. The prior research handles such a problemthrough a methodology based on the stochastic profit or cost,which is ineffective without considering the balance between theobtained profit of investors and the transportation cost of targetcustomers. The goal of this work is to establish the tradeoff FLAmodel, i.e., to obtain assuredly the specific profit of investors,while minimizing the transportation cost of the service costumersfor FLA. Both theoretical and simulation results demonstrate thatthe proposed approach is effective and feasible. Such results can help decision makers perform better judgments when a practicalFLA is executed.
