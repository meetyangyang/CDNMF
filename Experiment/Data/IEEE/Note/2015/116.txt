Robust stability and tracking problems are two well-known topics in the field of control;  which play an important role in real application and attract the researchers' attention all the time. Especially;  these issues on nonlinear systems still remain challenging owing to complexity and the nonlinear characteristic property. Another challenging issue in nonlinear control is the effects from uncertainties. Motivated by these issues;  robust control design by using operator theoretic-based approach has caused for concern owing to its effectiveness in dealing with nonlinearity and uncertainties. This paper provides a survey of the research in the above issues that would help practitioners in controlling nonlinear uncertain systems and in understanding the advantages of operator-based approach.
