This paper was motivated by the viabilityof UAVs to enhance automation in environmental monitoring,search-and-rescue missions, package delivery, and many otherapplications. As UAVs become an economically feasible option fordeployment, it becomes important to enhance their autonomy soas to increase productivity. In this paper, we develop an approachthat uses simple interactions among UAVs to promote maximizingthe area coverage while maintaining high sensor data quality andreducing the detection risk. The approach provides scalability,making it easy for UAVs to leave and join the mission as needed.Experimental results in simulation and with real quadcoptersprovide promising results. In future research, we would like totest and enhance the approach so that it can be used in variousapplications extending beyond laboratory testings.
