Traditionally, the HVAC operationproblem is solved by using time-based approaches where decisionsare calculated and executed at each discrete time instant. Theseapproaches usually have large computational requirements andslow responses to events. In this paper, an innovative event-basedapproach is developed so that decisions are calculated and executedonly on an “as needed” basis to reduce computational requirementsand have a fast response to events. The key of the approach is toaggregate the future information that affects day-ahead HVACenergy costs and augment the state to include the aggregatedinformation. The events are then defined based on the augmentedstate and make the non-stationary optimal policy stationary inthe planning horizon. Numerical results demonstrate significantcomputational time reduction and fast responses to events.
