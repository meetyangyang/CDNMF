In recent years, the diversity of print orders has increased in many dimensions due to mass customization. For instance, large variations are seen in the product types involved in an order, the size of an order, print quality requirement, and even the order due date. The factory status, which is measured by attributes such as resource utilization, work-in-progress, and resource availability/downtime, is also highly dynamic. The challenge of real-time scheduling for high volume of diverse orders limits print factory performance today. Our production scheduler considers stochastic factors that influence the on-time delivery of an order. It prioritizes orders and allocates resources for manufacturing. Such a dynamic production scheduler will therefore be invaluable for a realistic print factory that suffers from errorprone manufacturing processes, includes complex production procedures, and requires high on-time delivery ratio of orders.
