This paper was motivated by the problemof sharing resources in cloud robotic systems efficiently for accomplishing real-time tasks. Existing approaches to cloud roboticsbear very strict assumptions that the resources are unconstrainedand ubiquitous. However, there are technical challenges for multirobot systems to access the cloud and retrieve resources in nearreal-time. This paper presents a general framework for setting upcloud robotic system with a novel resource management strategy.We mathematically formulate the problem of multisensor dataretrieval through the cloud as a Stackelberg game, and proposean optimal solution with proof. We then define the QoS criteriafor evaluation considering the constraints of robotic tasks. In theexperimental scenarios, our management mechanism significantlyimproves the performance for multisensor data retrieval in theevaluation of QoS, CPU load, and bandwidth usage.
