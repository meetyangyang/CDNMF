Our research deals with understandingthe emerging behaviors of groups of simple, interacting agents. Themotivation for studying this subject is twofold. First, we seek an understanding of the mechanisms that govern collective motions of biological organisms in processes like wound healing, cancer growth,flocking and herding, etc. Second, we plan to apply our insights tothe design of controllers for swarms of autonomous robotic agentsprogrammed to carry out different tasks, such as area surveillanceor monitoring in uncertain environments. Swarming behavior istypically modeled for groups of identical agents, under the assumption that sensing and processing times are negligibly small. Weincorporate the real-world complications of: 1) finite sensing/processing time, which appears as a delay in our model of agent motion and 2) differences in the dynamical capabilities of swarmingagents. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the collective motionsof the swarm. We show the emergence of large-scale patterns inthe swarm motion as a function of the physical parameters of theswarm, as well as segregation of the agents into separate groupswhere all agents in a given group have identical dynamics.
