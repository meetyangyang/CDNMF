This paper is motivated by the problem of placing the minimum number of sensors for achieving maximal isolability in a system. Some existing approaches to search the optimal set of candidate sensors generally have performed relatively low efficiency when a system has many more candidate sensors and system faults. This paper suggests a new approach integrated with dynamic programming (DP). DP inherently qualifies an out-performance on searching solutions from large data. In this research, the approach is further improved by reducing the computational and space complexities of DP, resulting in higher efficiency. The case study results demonstrate that this approach has an out-performance in terms of efficiency. In future research, the sensor placement problem takes more requirements such as sensor weight, sensor volume, and sensor reliability, under consideration besides detectability and isolability.
