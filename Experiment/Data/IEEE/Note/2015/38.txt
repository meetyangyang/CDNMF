This work is motivated by the need of performing an accurate quality control on cable production: an automated inspection method is necessary for effectively assuring aquality check on 100% of the produced parts. The vision systemexploits a compact acquisition hardware enabling the system to beeasily integrated in existing cable crimping machines. The softwaresystem is composed by two main modules: the first one localizes thewires, while the second performs color measurements. This paperexplains how it is possible to segment wires also when they are bentin many different ways; moreover, a reliable method for identifying colors, which is robust to wire markings and highlights, isdescribed. The proposed system is able to automatically adjust tolerances in color measurement depending on the colors of the wiresto be checked. This represents a strong point of the system, and itcan be applied also in other contexts where color analysis on noisydata needs to be performed.
