This paper deals with the introduction ofEEE in the industrial communication scenario, with specific attention to RTE networks. The work was motivated by the continuousneed for efforts to increase energy efficiency at all levels of factory automation systems. Particularly, the IEEE 802.3az amendment represents a significant opportunity even if, unfortunately,it does not explicitly refer to industrial networks. The assessmentcarried out in this paper, besides confirming the possibility of aprofitable adoption of EEE by RTE networks, raised up several aspects of interest for practitioners. Indeed, the cyclic traffic typicalof industrial networks reveals suitable to support EEE strategies.Nonetheless, even in case a strict network synchronization is maintained, additional delays may possibly affect frame delivery due tothe time overhead introduced by the LPI mode. The adoption ofsuitable strategies may, however, mitigate the impact of such delays. Also, it has been shown that acyclic traffic requests may reduce the effectiveness of EEE strategies, since they could introducefrequent undesired changes of the Ethernet links status. Finally, wewould like to stress the importance of carrying out extensive measurement sessions on real testbeds, since outcomes from practicalexperiments definitely represent the best way to validate the theoretically designed EEE strategies.
