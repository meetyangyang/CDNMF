The main objective of this work is to provide an adaptive video transmission control system and methodology to improve the real-time video quality, which takes the realtime network information into the video transmission control over heterogeneous networks. Our solution is an application-layer protocol and includes three phases: 1) to collect the network and video flow status simultaneously; 2) to adjust the parameters for video quality dynamically that come from the network and video environment feedback; and 3) to optimize the video coding rate that is in accordance with the current environment conditions. Our solution is easy to deploy and implement quickly, may help to extensively ensure video quality for normal users
