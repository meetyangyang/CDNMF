Ribbons are used in the design of efficientwiring, plumbing, transportation, architecture, and many otherfields. This paper addresses the challenge of computing a setof smooth, disjoint ribbons within a constrained space to reacha specified set of target zones, motivated by the need to routemultiple smooth channels through a custom 3D printed implantto deliver radiation to cancerous tumors. This paper proposescombining sampling-based motion planning with trajectory optimization to compute arrangements of ribbons. Experimentssuggest that the resulting arrangements are superior to arrangements that consist of each channel in isolation.
