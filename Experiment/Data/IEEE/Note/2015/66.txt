This work presents a home access controlsystem based on speech. We use whispered speech instead of natural speech because whispered speech is considered having highprivacy and being not easy to be copied. This work achieves goodspeaker recognition accuracy. In future works, we will focus onimproving the robustness of the home access control system andmaking it to be more efficient.
