Multirobot systems commonly sufferfrom limited computational resources, which interferes with theability of each individual robot to finish the task underway. Generally in these scenarios, the use of the available computationalpower varies over time. Hence, based on the Robotic Clustersconcept, we propose to allocate computational resources availablein the multirobot system to solve computationally hard problemsarising in the real world. As a case study, we propose two architectures for a solidary multirobot system engaged in a SLAM task. Inthis paper, we thoroughly discuss the tradeoffs of the architecturesproposed in terms of efficiency, complexity, exchange of data, loadbalancing and SLAM performance.
