It becomes increasingly common for an industrial park to provide a supply hub for its member enterprises to share warehousing and transportation services. The SHIP gains its main revenue from leasing storage space. Hence;  it is natural that SHIP must establish a suitable storage pricing strategy to attain the maximum profit. Being motivated by this challenge;  this paper investigates a dynamic storage pricing of SHIP in a typical supply chain with one SHIP and multiple manufacturers. We develop a bilevel model to study this problem and derive the optimal solutions in closed-form for special cases. We provide valuable managerial guidance for the SHIP operator to charge dynamic storage price;  and for member enterprises to schedule their replenishment and delivery under different scenarios. Several counterintuitive findings are obtained regarding the influence of delivery costs inside and outside the industrial park;  which will attract attention from managers of SHIP and member firms. This paper is limited to certain assumptions in deriving the optimal decisions. In future research;  we will relax the assumption and design other methods to solve the proposed bilevel model. We will also investigate other forms of storage pricing strategies;  which will shed further light on SHIP's decision automation.
