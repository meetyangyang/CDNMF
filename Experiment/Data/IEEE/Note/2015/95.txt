This work proposes a Petri net and ODE-based method for the system performance analysis. A concurrent system is first modeled by a Petri net. It is then converted into a continuous Petri net, which can be represented by a set of ODEs. Finally, the performance metrics can be derived from the ODE solutions that can be obtained in polynomial complexity. Thus, the proposed method can entirely avoid the state explosion problem often encountered by commonly used Markov chain based methods. This method can be applied to business systems, e-commerce, automated production systems, service computing, workflow analysis, and computer communication systems.
