The prognosis of the future health status in degrading systems using sensor data generally requires many distributional assumptions;  such as a parametric relationship between the hidden degradation level and sensor measurements;  and a predefined degradation threshold. This paper proposes a new model that formulates the relationship between degradation level;  sensor measurements;  and operating conditions in a multi-layer generative manner that helps accommodate interpretability and uncertainty. Results obtained utilizing simulated and real-life data prove that the developed method can yield reasonable prognostic estimates for important measures;  such as the remaining useful life of the system.
