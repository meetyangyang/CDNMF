Although intercell scheduling problems have been studied in the literature, it is still common to rely on manually generated schedules in industrial environments. This paper does not attempt to seek solutions directly, but try to automatically design good heuristic rules to address the problem, so that the computation efficiency that is required by real-time decision and the optimization performance that is important for a complex problem, can be satisfied at the same time.
