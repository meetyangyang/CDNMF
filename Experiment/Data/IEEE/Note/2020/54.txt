The widespread use of computer-aided design (CAD) models for describing parts assembly has motivated the research community to create systems that automatically generate robot programs satisfying the assembly goal. While most of the existing literature focuses on generating the assembly sequence;  this article deals with the aspect of translation from CAD-level assembly specification to executable robot motion;  also called skills. This article systematically addresses the problem by dividing it into different layers and solving them separately. Parameters that influence the successful execution of an assembly task are identified and categorized into application- and process-related parameters. Different inference techniques are employed to address each parameter category. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully generate and execute robot skills for assembly scenarios of an air compressor and an electric motor.
