This paper was motivated by considering the existence of target localization error in two spaces tobe registered in a rigid point-based registration. Given fiduciallocalization error (FLE) and TLE probability distributions,the proposed TTRE model gives the covariance matrix and rootmean square of TTRE at a given target point. The possibleapplications of the proposed TTRE model in an image-guidedsurgery (IGS) include: 1) estimation of surgical tool-tip trackingerror distribution when pivot calibration uncertainty is considered; 2) accuracy evaluation of an image-to-patient registration; 3) updating of a preoperative surgical plan on a computedtomography/MRI image to consider the registration error at agiven target point; and 4) estimation of real-time tool-tip errorin touching a desired “true” surgical target, such as a tumorduring surgery. To use the proposed error estimation algorithm,FLE and TLE in two spaces to be registered have to be knownor estimated in advance to a registration process. The proposederror model is validated through extensive simulations.
