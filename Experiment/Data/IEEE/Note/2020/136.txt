A soft robotic table is developed for the manipulation of delicate objects on a surface. The table is intended for automated sorting tasks in an industrial environment. Multiple objects placed on the table surface can be simultaneously and independently transported and orientated on the XY horizontal plane. The deformable surface of the table provides soft handling for delicate objects. These are the advantages over existing manipulators such as robotic arms and belt conveyor systems. Based on previously conducted experiments, it was found that the open-loop control is ineffective to execute automation tasks due to the variability in object movements with soft interactions. To solve this problem, a closed-loop control system for autonomous object manipulation is developed and its detailed design and implementation are presented in this article. A vision feedback system and a controller are developed to form the proposed closed-loop control. Two sets of experiments involving common manipulation tasks were conducted. The control system is proven to be effective at handling the uncertainties in object movements and autonomous object manipulation by the soft robotic table is validated. The performance of this control system can be improved with better predictions of both the deformations on the table surface and the resultant object movements. Embedding deformable sensors into the table surface is a potential approach to achieve such improvement and this can be investigated in future works.
