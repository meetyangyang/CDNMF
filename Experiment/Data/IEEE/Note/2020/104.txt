In the context of AMS, liveness is the most important property since it implies that there is no partial deadlock during the system evolution, and hence, all part types can be produced smoothly. We study the problem of liveness for AMS with the most general resource allocation and flexible routing, which can be modeled by S4PRs or disjunctive/conjunctive (D/C) resource allocation systems (RASs). Given such a complex AMS, based on its Petri net model, this paper presents a sufficient and necessary liveness condition by utilizing the structural properties, and develops an algorithm to identify all the structural objects that may lead the systems to deadlocks. This paper is significant in liveness-enforcing supervisor design for S4PR.
