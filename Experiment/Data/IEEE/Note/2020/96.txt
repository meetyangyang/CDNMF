In a modern large commercial building, the exorbitant LC is an important problem for the engineering technicians and managers, and the hybrid lighting system which combines artificial light with natural light offers a solution to this problem. However, the minimum light-energy optimal control is a very key problem in manipulating multigroup lighting equipment, since the required level of illumination usually varies according to the exterior lighting environment. This paper contributes to a useful multivariate extremum seeking controller to solve these light-energy control problems for multiple-input single-output hybrid lighting system, whereas the PID controller is also designed to maintain the required level of illumination simultaneously. This paper discusses how to seek the minimal energy necessary for the required levels of illumination by separately regulating different light equipment. The research results of this paper will be beneficial for a practical application of extremum seeking control method in enhancing the lighting energy efficiency of lighting system.
