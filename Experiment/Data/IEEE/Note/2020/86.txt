This article develops a scalable computing framework for multizone HVAC controller, which canhelp reduce the electricity cost while maintaining the comfortabletemperature bands set by the occupants. The proposed computingparadigm is scalable to large buildings as it mainly requires local zone-level computation. Specifically, for multizone buildings witha central shared HVAC system, the zone controllers determine theoperations of their local variable air volume (VAV) boxes mainlythrough local computation and some necessary communicationswith the other entities. Consequently, this control techniquecan be implemented via local controllers deployed on simplehardware while applied to large buildings. The performance(electricity cost and computation time) of the controller isvalidated through a comparison with the centralized method andthe DTBSS by using simulations.
