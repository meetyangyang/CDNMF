Elevating transfer vehicles (ETVs) are widely utilized in automated multi-level material handling systems for transporting;  storing;  and retrieving units vertically and horizontally. We develop an efficient and effective method to reduce energy consumption of operating ETV;  which is critical for improving both financial and environmental sustainability of these systems. The method can be adopted to realize online timely decision making for automatic vehicle routing when facing a huge number of pickup and delivery requests in multi-level material handling systems. A class of popular application scenarios;  termed “Free-Permutation; ” is identified and mathematically characterized;  in which the energy consumption can be exactly minimized in a theoretical sense within tractable computational times. For general application scenarios;  an efficient and robust method is designed to guarantee to save the energy consumption to a level lower than 67% above the theoretical minimum level. Preliminary numerical experiments suggest the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach;  but it has not yet been incorporated into nor tested in a practical system. In the future research;  we will approach the application scenarios with two or more ETVs simultaneously operated in a multi-level material handling system.
