It is significant but challenging workto realize the control of manufacturing processes based onreal-time production data. Thus, this paper integrates RFIDdata of jobs with energy-efficient control of CNC machinetools, and proposes a deep learning methodology of processingthe real-time production data in an RFID-enabled ubiquitousenvironment. Considering the relationship between different jobs,five energy-efficient control strategies for multiple machine toolsare put forward to reduce the carbon emission of the machiningprocesses. Then, an RFID-driven process progress evaluation iscarried out to quantify the real-time progress, and two RFIDdata preprocessing algorithms are developed to cleanse andextract the original data. DBNs are adopted to realize theenergy-efficient strategies selection of CNC machine tools. Theexperiments from an actual printing machine manufacturingenterprise indicate that the proposed method is effective andefficient for the energy-efficient control problem of machinetools. The implementation requires RFID-enabled manufacturingenvironment deployment, RFID data capturing and prepressing,and deep learning model establishment based on historicalproduction data. Beyond the energy conservation of machine tools, the proposed method can also be applied to other industrialproblems, e.g., self-perception and self-adjustment of smartmachine tools, production rescheduling decisions, and logisticsrouting optimization.
