In recent years, the management ofconnected stops (or passengers exchange hubs) has been thesubject of many research works in order to reduce their socioeconomic and environmental impacts (e.g., congestion, unbearable passengers waiting times, and CO2 emissions). The explosionof passengers number within public transportation systemsas well as the increasing complexity of multimodal networksrequires the investment in more adapted services to ensure theefficient and competitive management for passenger displacementespecially when using different transportation modes. For thisend, the proposed approach in this work is conducted by usinga hybrid approach based on graphical and mathematical tools for optimal management of passengers exchange through theexchange hubs. This article suggests a new hybrid approach,thus allowing modeling both the transportation means andrelated events, and passenger flows. We then show how suchan approach can efficiently allow transportation companies tobe more attractive and competitive. The proposed approachcan be considered as a decision-making system for assistingtransportation companies to provide relevant services for theirclients in terms of transportation while minimizing engaged costsin terms of used transportation means. The added value ofthis system is more significant in the peak periods and whenunpredictable incidents occur. This will considerably participateto increase the MTS performance indicators.
