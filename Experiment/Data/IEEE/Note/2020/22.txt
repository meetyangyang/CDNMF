The end-point prediction is critical tothe quality of products produced in the iron and steel productionprocess. Because of the complexity of the physiochemical reactions during smelting, it is difficult to build mechanism modelsfor the complex environment. Generally, expert knowledge andexperience are needed for real production. The motivation behind this article was to establish a data-driven model through machinelearning methods to solve end-point prediction problems. First,a stacked autoencoder (SAE) was used to extract the essentialinformation from the original data. Second, sparse Bayesianregression (SBR) was applied to the top layer. Thus, the predictedmean values and error bars could be obtained to improve therobustness of the prediction model. Furthermore, an improveddifferential evolution (DE) algorithm was designed to adaptivelyoptimize the hyperparameters of the model. In the experiments,the proposed method was applied to two real steelmakingproduction processes. The results verify the effectiveness of theproposed model. This article can be extended to other processessuch as continuous casting and reheating furnace. The model canalso be generalized for other practical industries to improve theproduct quality and enable safer production.
