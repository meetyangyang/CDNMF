Identifying and documenting uncertainties;  which may occur during operation of a system;  is a common problem in engineering processes. Such uncertainties may lead to severe damage;  and thus need to be mitigated appropriately. It is crucial to account for these uncertainties during engineering;  especially in the early phases. Depending on the specific project characteristics;  a multitude of different diagram types are used to model a system. Uncertainties thus reflect in many artifacts;  which leads to: 1) redundancies in the specified uncertainty attached to diagram elements and 2) uncertainty information (e.g.;  about the cause or effect of uncertainty) that is spread across different diagrams. The latter makes it difficult to structure uncertainty information and trace it throughout the engineering process so that uncertainty can be systematically considered. Our approach provides a graphical modeling language that employs a dedicated perspective on uncertainty in separate diagrams that can be linked to any engineering artifact.
