In the practical engineering systems,many useful signals and interference vary randomly. Therefore,the tracking control of stochastic systems and dynamics, such asthe Markovion, Itô’s, Wiener, and Martingale processes, playsan important role in the modern industry. As a matter of fact,it is always desired to reduce the requirement of exact information and transition probability in the homogeneous Markovianprocess, which is very difficult to obtain accurate measurements.One way is integrating the adaptive reinforcement learning (RL)technique into the Markovian systems to learn this implicitinformation. However, a major restriction of the RL technique isthat the control policy should be related to the finite performance index, which generally invalidates the optimal tracking solutions.In order to tackle this difficulty, by designing a novel parallelscheme via integral RL (IRL) technique, the solution of the coupled algebraic Riccati equation is solved, and the transition probability can be completely unknown during the learning process.
