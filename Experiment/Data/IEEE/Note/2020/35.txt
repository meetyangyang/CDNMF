The proposed method aims to obtain an accurate estimation of a thermal field when certain sensor data are inaccessible. To better implement this method in practice;  three things are noteworthy: First;  the mean profile of the thermal field should be extracted using the thermodynamic model;  so that the remaining data are able to follow a Gaussian process. Second;  the FML approach considers neighboring data sources from homogeneous thermal fields to achieve an accurate estimation of the target thermal field. Thus;  the target thermal field and other thermal fields should be under similar external conditions;  e.g.;  environmental surroundings;  geographical location;  and field size. Third;  the proposed method can not only process the data from grid-based sensor networks;  but also can be extended to other topological structures of sensor networks for field estimation.
