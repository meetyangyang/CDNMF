Due to the recent growth of online shipping, the design of automated warehousing systems is receiving much attention. Most automated warehousing systems introduce multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for transportation. This article presents an efficient optimization of guide path design considering congestions and dynamic multicommodity flow routing. We develop cell-based local search heuristics for the guide path design problem for AGV systems that can be applied to a large-scale transportation model to solve the problem efficiently. Our major finding is that the guide path design with the dynamic multicommodity flow can significantly reduce the delays caused by congestions and improve the efficiency of the warehousing systems. The effectiveness of the derived guide path design is evaluated by simulation software. The feasibility of the guide path is confirmed in several case studies.
