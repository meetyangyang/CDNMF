This article presents single-objective/multiobjective cat swarm optimization clustering analysis methods for data partition. Through automatically extracting meaningful or useful classes;  clustering analysis could help the practitioners or the intelligent devices find the specific meanings of data;  natural data structure;  the data relationships;  or other characteristics. The proposed methods use the cat swarm to search the optimal clustering result. One or more criterion functions could be selected as the optimization objectives. The time complexity of the multiobjective type is higher than that of the single-objective type. Therefore;  in the industrial field;  engineers should choose the number of the optimization objectives based on the actual requirements. The proposed methods could be widely used into industrial applications to deal with complex data sets. Future research could consider some more progressive optimization schemes to improve the effectiveness.
