This paper deals with a scheduling problem arising from CC to HR process in steel manufacturing. It decomposes the original problem into a CCâ€“HR scheduling problem and a reheating furnace scheduling problem. Previously, such a problem is handled, respectively, which always cause energy waste and mismatching plan. This paper takes complex technology constraints into full account to minimize energy waste and energy requirement and establishes nonlinear mathematical models for studied problems. Then, it designs a hybrid algorithm combined mixed-integer programming and constraint programming. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can solve them effectively. The obtained solution gives decision makers some desired reference to determine a right schedule when actual production tasks are executed.
