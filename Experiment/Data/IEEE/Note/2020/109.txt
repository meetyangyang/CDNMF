This paper is motivated by the problem of driving a small-scale swimming robot with a helical body by magnetic fields along a predefined path. The proposed new closed-loop control uses features directly extracted in the image space as feedbacks. We demonstrated with experiments that the helical swimming robot can follow an arbitrarily given path on the plane using the proposed control method. The proposed control method is also successfully applied to obstacle avoidance tasks.
