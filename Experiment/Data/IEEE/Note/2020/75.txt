The palpation of tumors motivated this article in the robot-assisted surgical systems through tactile feedback. In order to mimic the human touch on the soft tissue;  this article presents a deep-learning-based approach to estimate the depth of the hard inclusions in the phantom tissue through force information. The displacement of the palpation probe and the touch force during one palpation are recorded as data sequences to train the deep model;  which aims to capture dynamics and long-term dependence of the palpation process. In this article;  we made the first successful attempt to accurately estimate the depth of the hard inclusions buried at different locations of the phantom tissue using only force information. The proposed approach can work in different robot-assisted scenarios;  such as master-slave robotic surgery. In the clinic applications;  the force sensor will be integrated at the end-effector of the robotic manipulator. According to the specific requirements;  the force sensor and the robotic manipulator might be different from those used in this article. For some applications;  such as the laparoscopic interventions;  the complete vertical contact tends to be difficult to obtain due to the laparoscopic port effects. The projection of the recorded force data and displacement can obtain the information in the normal direction. The future work is going to be extended to tissue environments with arbitrary surface and tumors with various shapes/depths for more complex and prospective clinical applications.
