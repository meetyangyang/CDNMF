This paper investigates the profit maximization problem for a DGDC provider;  while the average response time of all arriving tasks of each application is within their corresponding constraint. Existing task scheduling approaches fail to jointly consider the spatial variations in many factors;  including the revenue;  price of power grid;  solar radiation;  wind speed;  the maximum amount of energy;  on-site air density;  and the number of servers in DGDCs. Consequently;  they cannot schedule all tasks of multiple applications within their response time constraints in a profit-sensitive way. In this paper;  a profit-sensitive spatial scheduling (PS3) method that tackles the drawbacks of previous approaches is presented. It is achieved by adopting a proposed genetic-simulated-annealing-based particle swarm optimization algorithm that solves a constrained nonlinear program. Simulation experiments prove that compared with two typical scheduling approaches;  it increases the total profit and throughput. It can be readily realized and incorporated into real-life industrial DGDCs. The future work should improve the proposed method by analyzing the indeterminacy in green energy and the uncertainty in tasks.
