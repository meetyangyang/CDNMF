The motivation behind this article is the design of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system that can grasp marine products on the real seabed and perform other underwater intervention tasks. Currently;  the predominant method of fishing for marine products relies on human divers;  which has disadvantages for human divers' health due to the long periods of time spent working underwater. In order to further study the problem;  this article develops a hybrid-driven underwater vehicle-manipulator system (HD-UVMS) to work in a real seabed environment. A hybrid-driven motion control framework is presented using the thrusters to achieve effective cruising and searching for marine products and long fin propulsors for the fine pose adjustment required to grasp marine products. The proposed lightweight underwater manipulator can grasp marine products on the seabed with the aid of a vision system. A series of experiments suggests that the HD-UVMS is practical and valid.
