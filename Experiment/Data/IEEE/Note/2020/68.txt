This article was motivated by theproblem of operational adjustment in the copper cleaner flotationprocess. Because of the current manual operational adjustment,controlling the concentrate grade within its acceptable range isdifficult. This article suggests a hybrid Bayesian network (BN)approach to address this problem. The hybrid BN model is builtoffline and used to make inferences online. Compared with aconventional discrete BN, this approach can provide operatorswith specific adjustment values to qualify the concentrate grade. For the evaluation, data experiments are used. This evaluationshows the efficiency and superiority of the proposed approach interms of automation, intelligence, and decision-making.
