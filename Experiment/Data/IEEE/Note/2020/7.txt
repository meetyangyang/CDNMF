Under the smart grid paradigm, smartgreenhouses can be taken as an alternative that can mitigateand face the development challenges of the agricultural sector.Smart greenhouses can be considered as active players thatmay play a key role in modernizing the agriculture by offeringviable and new smart management solutions, advanced controlstrategies, and innovative decision-support tools, whose objectiveis to better support growers, investors, and professionals. Smartnetwork of greenhouses integrated microgrid (NGIM) can playan increasing role in enhancing the sustainable energy supplyin the agricultural sector. In addition, the incorporation of newinformation and communication technologies, advanced meteringinfrastructure, and optimal control strategies can support theagricultural sector to meet an increasing number of regulationson quality and environment. In this paper, a comprehensivescheduling optimization model-based MPC that considers fluctuations of stochastic renewable sources, as well as weather conditions, is formulated to optimally control the operation ofthe NGIM. We developed and validated an intelligent control andmanagement system-based MPC algorithm for a NGIM that maybe considered as a practical solution to mitigate and address thedevelopment challenges and support the transition to precisionand sustainable agriculture as well as the modernization of theagriculture.
