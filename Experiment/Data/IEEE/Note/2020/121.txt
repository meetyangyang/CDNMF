In practice, there are dynamic metrology delays that have not been adequately addressed. This study developed a robust monitoring system that can consider metrology delay for advanced control and effective compensation of the overlay errors. A study based on empirical data has validated the practical viability of the proposed approach. Indeed, the proposed algorithm can obtain a high degree of reliability for the measurement data in the complicated semiconductor fabrication process. Indeed, the developed solution is implemented in real practice.
