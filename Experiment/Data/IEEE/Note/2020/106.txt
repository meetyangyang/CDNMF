Many industrial robotic applications require the robotic system to be calibrated in order to achieve the demanded accuracy. Unfortunately, the existing calibration processes are often cumbersome or require expensive measurement systems. This paper presents a novel calibration method to simultaneously calibrate a 6-DoF industrial robot and a 2-D laser scanner attached to the robot’s flange. The method only uses the data from the robot and the laser, so there is no need for external measurement systems. The laser scanner can also be used after the calibration for subsequent robot tasks such as scanning a workpiece to accurately determine its location. The calibration setup only requires a flat plane and a sharp tool-tip attached on the robot’s flange. The proposed method is easy to deploy and is more cost-effective than existing calibration methods.
