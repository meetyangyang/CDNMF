Machine degradation is commonly observed in many industries;  such as automotive;  semiconductor;  and food production;  which gradually deteriorates the machine conditions in different operating processes and affects the production system performance. In practice;  sensors are largely deployed on the factory floor to monitor the machine's operating condition. However;  a gap still exists between machine operating conditions and system performance. In this paper;  we develop an analytical model to predict the machine remaining lifetime and estimate the system performance of a small scale production system;  using the machine degradation signals from sensors. Furthermore;  a Bayesian updating scheme is provided;  which enables online evaluation by utilizing the real-time signals. Such a method provides an effective tool for production engineers to analyze the real-time system performance;  and further conduct system improvements and control.
