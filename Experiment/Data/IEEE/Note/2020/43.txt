The work reported in this article will be useful for deploying multirobot teams to support complex logistics missions spread over a large area where the robots must be prepared to handle contingencies that can adversely impact the mission. The proposed proactive approach can be used to handle contingencies in information gathering;  surveillance;  guarding;  and situational awareness tasks to support safe and secure transportation of important assets through crowded areas. We use port operation as an illustrative example where unmanned surface and aerial vehicles can be useful in ensuring the safety and security of the ports. This is a computationally challenging problem. This article proposes heuristic algorithms to solve the task allocation problem among many different agents efficiently. The approach presented in this article integrates the available information regarding mission and contingencies;  along with the resource constraints to plan the mission execution.
