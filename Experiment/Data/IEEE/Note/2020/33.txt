This article proposes a method forefficient and interpretable modeling of processes with highdimensional (HD) data, such as waveform signals. Especially,the proposed method generates a regression model that predictsa function (e.g., a sensorâ€™s readings over time) using severalfunctional inputs. Existing functional regression techniques aremostly limited to a single functional input and are focused onprofile data. In many applications, however, a large number ofprocess variables are available for estimating an HD output,such as an image. This article addresses these problems byemploying basis functions to reduce the dimension of functionsand introducing specific penalties that removes noninformativeinputs and improves computational efficiency. A model generatedby the proposed approach can be used for process monitoring andoptimization. Using simulation and case studies, the performanceof the developed method is evaluated and compared with othermethods under various scenarios. This can provide practitioners with useful guidelines for selecting an appropriate method forprocess modeling.
