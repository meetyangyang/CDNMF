Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for smart buildings by addressing the fact that FDD systems are of great importance for saving energy and improving occupancy comfort levels and building safety levels. Existing FDD methods are mainly based on the assumption that sensor data are complete and reliable, which are rarely true in real practice. To solve the building FDD problem with incomplete data, in this article, the adjacent information recovery (AIR) filter is proposed to recover the missing data before applying FDD methods. The AIR filter takes the time series adjacency information into consideration via hidden Markov model (HMM) and includes the channel adjacency information with the collaborating filtering technique.
