A modern process is generally characterized by a large scale and complex nonlinear correlation, and monitoring of such nonlinear plant-wide processes is imperative. Nowadays, a large amount of process data is generally available, and deep neural network-based monitoring is promising in dealing with such data on nonlinear processes. This article proposes a deep discriminative representation learning method for efficient nonlinear plant-wide process monitoring. The key idea is to first decompose a large-scale process into multiple units according to a variable relationship, and then generate faulty validation data based on randomized fault construction. Then, deep discriminative representations are learned by optimizing a stacked autoencoder-based deep neural network (DNN). This article provides guidelines for designing an efficient monitoring algorithm for plant-wide nonlinear processes in the industrial big data environment.
