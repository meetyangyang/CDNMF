This paper was motivated by generalcooperative projects whose tasks have tree-structured relationships. This can make the problem of successful multitaskassignment extremely challenging. The traditional method ofassignment such as the KM algorithm can no longer solve thisproblem. To solve the assignment problem with tree-structuredrelationships, an efficient many-to-many assignment with constraints is required. The proposed approach provides theoreticaland technical foundations for efficient assignment of TSTA,which can not only provide a viable and effective assignment scheme for TSTA problems but also help human resource officersto formulate reasonable plans according to the relationshipsbetween/among tasks.
