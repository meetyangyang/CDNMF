Currently;  the adaption of automated material flow systems (aMFSs) concerning their layout requires modifications to the control software;  including extensive testing. This conflicts the demand for flexible and reconfigurable aMFSs due to changing requirements throughout a system's life cycle. A promising approach is the modularization of aMFSs;  including their control to ease layout changes and adaptations to changing material flows (known as Plug and Produce in the scope of Industrie 4.0). However;  common concerns when implementing agent-based control are the real-time capability of the controlled systems and the trust of operators in the automation regarding the safety and security of these systems. More precisely;  it is feared that operators might be unable to distinguish the benevolent and malevolent behaviors of an aMFS if agents make decisions autonomously. The concept we present here addresses these issues by establishing different communication types classified according to varying real-time requirements;  and by supporting operators via a human-machine interface to make agent decisions comprehensible.
