Automatic defect inspection has become a fundamental research topic in engineering application field. Specifically, sewer defect detection is an important measure for maintenance, renewal, and rehabilitation activities of sewer infrastructure. In the current operation procedure, all the captured videos need to be inspected by experts frame by frame to recognize defects, yielding a significant low inspection rate with a significant amount of time. Previous work has attempted to employ traditional image processing methods for automated sewer defect classification. However, these methods get poor generalization capabilities since they use pre-engineered features. In most cases, sewerage inspection companies have to hire numerous professional inspectors to do this job, thereby consuming a lot of human and material resources. To address this problem, the authors propose an automatic detection and classification method for sewer defects based on hierarchical deep learning. Demonstrated by various experiments, the designed framework achieves a high defect classification accuracy, which can be easily integrated into an automatic sewer defect inspection system.
