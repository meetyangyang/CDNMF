Although the case studies on two realworld industrial processes have verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the Bayesian nonlinear Gaussian mixture regression (BNGMR) for industrial applications, it is still worth emphasizing that before training the BNGMR, some important works on data preprocessing should be done, which include: 1) careful selection of explanatory variables that are closely related to primary variables; 2) time alignment matching between primary and explanatory variables; and 3) dealing with samples with missing values (for example, removing them) and elimination of outliers. We suggest to complete 1) and 2) based on process mechanisms and to pay particular attention to removing the outlier, as the presence of outliers could skew the estimations of Gaussian components and result in significant performance deterioration.
