This paper aims to real-time forecast the condition of operating units given their real-time multisensor data. In particular, this paper proposes a data fusion framework that fuses the multisensor data to construct a health index signal. The health index is designed to distinguish between any two degradation states during the lifecycle of a unit. Therefore, it can be used to estimate the remaining life to reach any degradation state including failure, which helps to raise early maintenance and safety alarms. The overall procedure can be summarized in the following steps: 1) the architecture of the health index is learned from the multisensor data of historical units that already failed; 2) this architecture is then applied to the real-time multisensor data of an operating unit to construct its real-time health index signal; 3) the real-time health index signal is forecast for future time instances; and 4) for each forecast time instance, the forecast health index value is compared with the historical health index signals to find the most likely degradation state of the operating unit at that time instance. The proposed approach was shown to be effective for applications with a single failure mode.
