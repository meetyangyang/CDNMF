Automatic and accurate underground pipeline mapping technology is very important in civil construction projects. Lack of 3D utility pipeline maps may lead to accidental damage in civil construction and maintenance. Although ground-penetrating radar (GPR-based pipeline mapping methods have been studied for several years;  these methods require the perpendicular scanning with respect to the pipe;  which is impossible to guarantee in practice since the orientations of pipelines are unknown. Furthermore;  these traditional methods can only estimate one pipeline at a time in a survey area and require prior knowledge of pipe diameter. We propose a robotic subsurface pipeline mapping method with a GPR and a camera to handle difficult factors such as multiple pipes;  unknown pipeline orientation;  and unknown pipeline diameters. Hence;  we can perform GPR scanning along any generic linear trajectories. Our method has been tested in physical experiments with representative pipeline configurations. The results are sufficiently accurate;  and it proves that our method can be an effective technology to reconstruct the underground pipelines.
