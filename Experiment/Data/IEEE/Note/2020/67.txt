In applications such as infrastructure inspection and plant protection;  the concerned area or terrain is required to be fully covered with the smallest possible time consumption. In view of these real-world requirements;  multiple unmanned systems with proper path planning provide a promising solution that can significantly enhance the efficiency as well as the robustness;  compared with a single-robot system. Especially;  centralized STC algorithms;  concerning the computation efficiency and trajectory redundancy of multiple unmanned systems;  demonstrate satisfactory effectiveness;  and thereby receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately;  most of the STC algorithms are proposed in a centralized control framework. Therefore;  it is worth to study its decentralized version that could exploit the advantages of the distributed multiple robots. With this consideration;  a decentralized AWSTC algorithm is proposed in this article. This spanning tree-based strategy artificially assigns priority weight for each cell;  with respect to each individual robot;  in the concerned area. With specially designed weight assignment;  each robot tends to construct a spanning tree with cells that are uncovered but keep away from the trees of its partners. Based on this;  the task burden as well as computational cost of each robot are almost equal. To improve the real-time performance;  a BÃ©zier transition trajectory-generation method is also used. With proper parameter selection;  robots can generate smooth trajectory with constant velocity in real-time missions. Numerical evaluations and experiments with real-time flight demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology.
