This article presents research into the application of intelligent methodologies to this problem and builds a framework to describe how this information can be captured;  generated;  and used within manufacturing production processes. This framework helps identify which areas require further research and serves as a basis for the development of a methodology;  by which a control system may enable adaptable behavior to reduce the impact of human performance variation and improve human-machine interaction (HMI). This article also presents a simulation-based case study to support the development and evaluate the presented control system on a representative real-world problem. The methodology makes use of a machine-learning approach to identify the complex influence of several identified human factors on human performance. This knowledge can be used to adjust the robotic behavior to match the predicted performance of multiple different operators over different scenarios. This adaptability reduces performance disparity by reducing idle times and enabling leaner production through workpiece-in-progress reduction. Future work will focus on expanding the intelligent capabilities of the proposed system to deal with uncertainty and improve decision-making ability.
