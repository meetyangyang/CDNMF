This article is motivated by the time-optimal and smooth motion planning problem for mobile robots along given paths. Existing approaches generally use the piecewise polynomial interpolations to smoothen and adjust feasible trajectories. This article proposes a novel path-constrained trajectory planning approach;  which preserves properties of completeness and a high-efficient tradeoff mechanism between the optimal and cruise motions when achieving a globally optimal and acceleration-continuous trajectory. Comparative experimental results with other methods show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In future research;  we will attempt to integrate the proposed approach with typical path planning methods to achieve a complete and high-efficient motion planning framework.
