This article was motivated by assembling a cabinet. The assembling process involves several pickand-place, reorientation, regrasp, alignment, peg-in-hole, andscrewing subtasks. The system distributes these subtasks to robotsand humans by exploiting their advantages and avoiding theirdisadvantages. The robot used is a dual-arm robot with twoparallel grippers. Thus, a suction cup tool is used for the pickand-place of thin objects. Soft-finger contact constraints areconsidered to assure safe manipulation. Human ergonomics areincluded as a quality for optimizing the handover between robotarms and robot and human. The proposed planner and systemshow satisfying user experience and expedite the cabinet assembly. It is expected to help relax the labor-intensive manufacturingprocess in the future.
