Pose estimation aims to obtain groundvehicleâ€™s position and heading in a certain coordinate system. Themultisensor fusion has been a popular solution in reducing estimation errors, and constraints are helpful in improving the poseestimation performance by limiting possible solutions. This articleproposes a framework to model multisensor pose estimationproblems with constraints. The approximated estimation schemeinspired by the Monte Carlo method has been provided such thatthe framework can be applied to various systems without analyticmodeling. Experiments in KITTI and self-collected sequenceshave been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of theproposed approach by fusing stereo visual odometry (SVO) andheading measurements under road constraints. The proposedapproach can be ameliorated by adding an absolute referencein translation to correct the inherent translational drift in VO.
