With growing digitalization in industry;  the exchange and use of manufacturing-related data are becoming increasingly important to improve;  support;  or automate processes. Thus;  it is necessary to combine information from different data sources that have been designed by different vendors and may;  therefore;  be heterogeneous in structure and semantics. A system that plans a maintenance worker's daily schedule;  for instance;  requires information about the status of machines;  production plans;  and inventory;  which resides in other systems;  such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or databases. When creating such information systems;  accessing;  searching;  and understanding the different data sources is a time-intensive and error-prone procedure due to the heterogeneities of the data sources. Even worse;  this procedure has to be repeated for every newly built system and for every newly introduced data source. To allow for eased access;  searching;  and understanding of these heterogeneous data sources;  ontology can be used to integrate all heterogeneous data sources in one schema. This article contributes a method for building such ontologies in the manufacturing domain. Furthermore;  a set of ontology design patterns is presented;  which can be reused when building ontologies for a domain.
