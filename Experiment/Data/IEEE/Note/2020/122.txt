This article is motivated by the need for flexible robotic assembly processes, and specifically the characterization of snap-fits, an assembly-type widely used in automated robotic processes. The snap-fit completion cannot be easily identified from a visual inspection, but the final result is usually realized by sensing the developed forces or identifying the snapping sound during a manual assembly. Training industrial robots to imitate the human snap-fit identification will allow accurate monitoring of such assemblies and the automation of the process with certainty for the final result. A quick and accurate perception of the process status can improve the overall process deployment speed and efficiency of such assemblies. The proposed framework allows the real-time characterization of the snap-fit process with very high accuracy and is easily implemented with collaborative robots. The framework can be further extended to other assembly processes using assembly forces as an indication signal.
