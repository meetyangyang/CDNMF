In this article, we explain our conceptand vision on how programs can be created and designed in away that makes it possible to run them on IIoT networks witha greater amount of flexibility than we have today. With thistechnology, it will be possible for programs to adapt to changesin their operation, and to changes in the network environment,in order to better utilize the available hardware resources. Thismeans that a dispersed automation system can continue itsoperation in certain situations where a traditionally deployedsystem would fail due to insufficient resources (e.g., memory,processing speed). It also means that the software can make betteruse of the underlying hardware whenever a special task needs tobe carried out (e.g., a “heavy” diagnostic process). We show someexperimental results of using our approach based on simulation.The way forward is to implement and evaluate this technologyin an industrial setting.
