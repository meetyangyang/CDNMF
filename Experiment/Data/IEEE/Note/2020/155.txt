In recent years;  the healthcare system in China has been implementing the policy that general hospitals (GHs) reserve a fixed amount of slots for referrals from community hospitals (CHs);  encouraging patients to choose CHs for initial diagnosis. However;  the reservation policy ignores the demand uncertainty and system dynamics;  which leads to circumstances where the reservations are either insufficient or underutilized most of the time. In the case of insufficient reservations;  referrals will experience a treatment delay;  while the underutilized slots lead to wastes of resources. In this work;  we propose a more effective method that optimizes the allocation of GH resources between referrals and nonreferrals. In addition to analyzing the structure of the optimal dynamic policy;  we design a heuristic policy that allows referrals to acquire resources earlier in time. This heuristic policy decides on a block time for the regular patients;  and before the block time regular patients are not allowed to access the system;  while referrals can get access to the resources freely. This policy is easy-to-implement and can better manage demand uncertainty. We provide an approach to calculate the policy and validate its performance both theoretically;  and numerically.
