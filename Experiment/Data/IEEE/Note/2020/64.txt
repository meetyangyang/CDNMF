This article deals with a new single-machine scheduling problem arising from an industrial wire rod and bar rolling process. A baseline method is given to tackle this problem by solving an established mixed-integer program. Afterward;  a two-stage decomposition method is proposed such that an industrial size problem can be solved. Computational results of both actual and simulated cases show that it is more efficient than the baseline method in solving the scheduling problem. It can get an optimal solution of the concerned problem with one-week-scale batches and jobs in short time;  thereby proving the readiness to put it in industrial use.
