This paper presents a curvaturebounded lengthening and shortening approach for path planningof vehicles. The curvature and obstacle constraints in the pathplanning problem are handled using the topological technique.In addition, a rigorous classification system is presented tosystematically categorize the potential paths. Within a pathclass, any path can be deformed to other paths while keepingthe curvature bounded. Then, the path deformation process isconducted via a series of basic homotopy operations to approachthe target length. The length coverage range of this process isreduced when some endpoint conditions are meet or the vehicleis trapped into a closed region.
