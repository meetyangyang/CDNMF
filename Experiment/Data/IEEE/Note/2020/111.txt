Understanding human balance and control of bicycles is crucial for not only designing bicycle-based rehabilitation devices but also studying physical human–machine interactions for healthcare automation. This paper takes the rider and bicycle as an example of physical human–machine interactions to understand how human use their limbs and body movement to stabilize an unstable platform (i.e., bicycles). We develop an instrumented bicycle system, called bikebot, to conduct human riding experiments. Using experimental data, we build the dynamic models for human steering and leaning control actions. Using these actuation models, stability analyses are conducted for rider–bicycle interactions and then validated by experiments. We also obtain the stability results by perturbing human visual and sensorimotor feedback. These results reveal that the visual feedback and the time delay in sensorimotor feedback mechanism play critical roles in stabilizing the unstable bicycle platform.
