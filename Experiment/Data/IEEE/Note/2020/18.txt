This paper was motivated by the problem of a need to detect abnormal operations in industrial gas regulators;  but it also applies to other industrial mechanical systems. Existing approaches to identifying abnormal operations in such systems are premised on rule-based methods that issue alarms if the measured response signal from a target system exceeds a certain fixed threshold. We propose an anomaly detection algorithm;  constructed on the basis of a multioutput Gaussian process regression that takes into account the correlations of multiple-target time series data. In particular;  the proposed method makes it possible to detect both pointwise anomalies (outlier) and trajectory anomalies (i.e.;  a systemic deviation between the measured and predicted target responses) in a single framework while adapting its prediction model with newly observed data. The proposed method was tested using data recorded from currently operating gas regulators. It was found that this method enabled one to detect the abnormal operations of the target system reliably. In the future research;  we will accelerate the learning and adapt the speed of the target system so that the method can be quickly run in a real-time system.
