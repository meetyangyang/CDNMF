The motivation behind this paper isdriven by current safety issues existing in robot-assisted bonecutting surgery, such as laminectomy. The main contribution of the present work is an algorithm to monitor the currentcutting depth. Compared to traditional systems, the key characteristics of the introduced model are: real-time (it can be usedintraoperatively); precision and safety (prediction error up toÂ±0.2 mm in target regions); and ease of use (no other imageguidance or tracking system is required). The approach cansuccessfully predict the current milling status and is sensitiveto changes in force conditions, which is especially crucial todetect the contact point between the ball-end milling tool andthe target bone. In summary, the proposed approach addressesthe challenge of improving the safety of robot-assisted surgery viamonitoring of the cutting depth. Experimental results on a freshbovine femur demonstrate promising performances. The presentimplementation specifically targets bone milling procedures, yetit can easily be extended to a wide range of other similar clinicalor industrial applications. Applicability is supported by the factthat the proposed algorithm can be implemented as a plug-inmodule and integrated into already existing image-guided roboticsurgery platforms.
