The research reported in this articlewill be very helpful to inventory management of perishableproducts, such as fruits and vegetables, which are very closelyrelated to our daily life. A joint optimization of price, orderingquantity, and freshness-keeping efforts will satisfy the demandnot only in correct quantity but also in good quality. The optimaljoint pricing, ordering, and freshness-keeping policy for a singleperiod is easy to implement and consumes little computationalefforts based on the mathematic analysis, which can guarantee itsfeasibility in real-life retailing systems. Moreover, it will becomea foundation of realizing joint optimization of price, orderingquantity, and freshness-keeping effort over the infinite horizonand under randomness, which will have a broader applicationarea.
