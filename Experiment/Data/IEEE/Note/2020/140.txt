It is widely believed that the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies will seamlessly connect countless smart devices, profoundly change the industry. Traditionally, field devices within the feedback control loops are isolated from the Internet by secure gateways. In the future, field devices will connect to the Internet in a more direct manner. To the best of our knowledge, no encryption algorithm is fast enough for hard real-time channels of existing industrial fieldbuses and, therefore, made mission-critical applications vulnerable to cyberattacks. We propose a novel recursive watermark (RWM) algorithm for hard real-time control system data integrity validation. This article serves industry practitioners in three ways. First, it is a timely caution to industrial IoT (IIoT) pilot users on the security challenges in real-time channels. Once a compromised edge device is connected to a field device, attackers have unlimited means to jeopardize valuable assets. In this article, we gave an example where attackers may damage shipboard assets by introducing millisecond-level delays. Second, since hard real-time encryption is not available, we propose a detour solution. With the proposed algorithm, even attackers may read the content in the real-time channel, and they cannot change it without being detected. We implemented the real-time RWM algorithms in structured control language (SCL) and tested on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller (PLC). Third, we provide theoretical analysis as design guidelines for practitioners to set up or customize the RWM algorithm per their specific applications.
