This article was motivated by a practicaloperational problem which occurs in container yards, steel slabyards, and many other warehouses. In a container yard, containers are stored vertically in stacks. Cranes are employed to movecontainers and can access only the topmost ones. If the containerto be retrieved is not at the top of a stack, containers above ithave to be relocated to other stacks. As relocations are very timeand energy-consuming, minimizing the number of relocationsinvolved in a retrieval process is a serious concern. Similarsituations can also be found in steel slab yards. In this article,in addition to theoretical derivations, we propose a strong MIPformulation and an MIP-formulation-based iterative procedureto compute optimal relocation plans with the least numberof relocations. Both methods have superior performances over state-of-the-art formulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that theMIP formulation can be flexibly customized to address additionalindustrial considerations, for example, stacking restrictions andthe energy cost. Hence, we believe that the presented results arepowerful management tools and can provide substantial decisionmaking support to practitioners.
