A well-informed decision made in cutting parameter optimization or process planning relies heavily on the accurate data delivered from the shop floor. In other words;  the decision made without the consideration of the shop-floor situation might not achieve the original goal or even fail to materialize. As these factors exist in a real manufacturing cycle;  how to integrate shop-floor scheduling with process planning and machining parameter optimization becomes essential for energy-efficient manufacturing. This article undertakes this challenge and develops a multiobjective optimization model;  where energy consumption of machining;  for the first time to the best of our knowledge;  is comprehensively analyzed at both the machine level and shop-floor level. Such broader integration makes this approach more practical and applicable to real industry settings;  particularly when the shop-floor resource is limited.
