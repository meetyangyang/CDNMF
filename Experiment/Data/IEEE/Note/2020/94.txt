Measuring and marking up of the interior works during building construction is time consuming and error prone. Layout must be repeated for each trade: partitions, false ceilings, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, and flooring and furnishings all require accurate marking of locations on floors, walls, and ceiling surfaces. Current automation is limited to the use of robotic total stations, but these only locate specific predetermined points. We propose a simple solution for automated layout, in which images from a building information model are projected directly onto the work surface. The system projects any desired information—drawings and images—onto the work surface (floor, walls, or ceiling) in the correct location, scale, and orientation. The prototype apparatus consists of a laser range scanner, a projector, and a camera. Projection of the work instructions directly onto the work surface is accurate and immediate. It saves the time required for workers to interpret and then mark up the dimensional information and it avoids the human error involved. The prototype is limited to environments in which computer projection is practical and currently requires planar surfaces.
