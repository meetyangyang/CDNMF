We propose condition-based maintenance for queues with degrading servers. The proposed model has been verified in simulation using degradation data of tools in a manufacturing facility. In order to implement, one must first model the underlying degradation process using the data from condition monitoring. We can get service and repair time distributions using data from the plant floor. Then, we need reasonable estimates of costs. These include costs of holding, quality, repair, and failure. They can be relative, prioritized or zero. The long-run average cost per unit time can then be evaluated. Then, the model provides the degradation state of the server at which maintenance is the most cost efficient. The degradation data can be used to continually obtain the optimal state of degradation at which the server can be taken offline with minimal costs.
