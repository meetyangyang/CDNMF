This article was motivated by the recent wide interest of precise targeted delivery using biohybrid magnetic microrobots. Driven by external magnetic fields;  microrobots accomplish the targeted delivery tasks. In practical applications;  obstacles and obstructed optical feedback often exist that make the delivery task challenging. The Mag-Spore presented here has a hollow structure;  so that the cargo-carrying capability is maximized and supported by the proposed automated control techniques;  and the delivery precision and efficiency are promised in multiple-obstacle scenarios. In addition;  the control method has the robustness to model uncertainties and external disturbances that should be considered and well solved in applications. Fluorescence imaging;  a common way for observing biomaterials;  is compatible with the proposed control scheme and the developed software so that the recognition and tracking of the Mag-Spore and other biomaterials are improved. Moreover;  the self-established plug-and-play (PnP) electromagnetic magnetic coil system has the feature of easy installation and configuration on fluorescence microscopes. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in fluorescence-guided targeted delivery using magnetic microrobots.
