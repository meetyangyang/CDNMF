VM allocation is one of the challenging problems in cloud computing systems;  especially when user task makespan and cost of cloud service providers have to be considered together. We propose an IDE approach to solve this problem. To show its performance;  this article compares the commonly used methods;  i.e.;  RR and min-min;  as well as the classic differential evolution method. A cloud simulation platform called CloudSim is used to test these methods. The experimental results show that the proposed one can well outperform its compared ones;  and its VM allocation results can achieve the highest satisfaction of both users and providers. The proposed method can be readily applicable to industrial cloud computing systems.
