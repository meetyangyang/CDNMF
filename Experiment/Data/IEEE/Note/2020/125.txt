Visual tracking can be applied in many intelligent automation systems, such as robotic intelligent navigation system, intelligent human–computer interaction system, and so on. In a robotic intelligent navigation system, visual tracking can generate target’s motion trajectory from image sequences. Visual tracking can also obtain body movement information automatically during the interactive process in the intelligent human–computer interaction system. Accuracy and speed are two key indicators for visual tracking, and intelligent automation systems usually need a tracker with more accuracy and faster speed. This article aims to develop a fast and accurate tracking method by adversarial feature sampling learning (AFSL). In the concrete implementation process, AFSL gets samples by sampling in the feature space rather than on raw images to reduce computation. Then, an adversarial learning mechanism is adopted to boost the sampling features and enrich the target appearances in the feature space to improve the tracking accuracy. The proposed tracker is proven to be effective to keep leading tracking accuracy while significantly accelerating the tracking speed.
