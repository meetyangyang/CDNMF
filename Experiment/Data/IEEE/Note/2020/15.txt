In the past few decades, due to thelarge-scale use and sophistication of automotive electronic systems, various in-vehicle communication networks and protocolsare also evolving. FlexRay is one such in-vehicle communicationprotocol, which provides the mechanism for the fault-toleranthigh-speed communication over FlexRay bus. FlexRay is widelybeing employed for safety-critical applications in the automotivedomain. For such applications, often the timing constraint isimposed with a bound on the worst case EED. Thus, timingproperties of the designed network must be verified beforeapplying it on the real domain such that the worst case EEDfor the propagation of an event at sensor end to actuatorend is known. The proposed estimation technique can be usedto compute approximate EED for an application scheduledwith other applications over the dynamic segment of FlexRay.In addition, various guidelines for designing the network in orderto reduce overestimation have also been presented.
