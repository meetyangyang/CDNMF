Welding is not only labor-intensive but also requires real-time adaption to the process;  which is challenging for robots/machines but relatively straightforward for humans. Using a human commanded robot to perform welding can liberate humans from laborious operations and hazardous environments. To this end;  a virtual reality (VR) system is used to create a virtual welding environment for a human to view the process remotely and for a human to pass his/her resultant adaptation to the robot through hand movements. However;  hand movements do not always fully represent the intended adaptation of the commanding human;  and the recognition of such human intention is fundamental in such a proposed method. This article established the mathematical framework for the recognition of the human intention and;  thus;  the foundation for effective assistance of robots to humans.
