In automated manufacturing systems (AMSs);  resources such as machines and tools with higher reliablity are always expensive. Sometimes;  when it is not cost-effective to use resources with higher reliability;  manufacturers may choose some resources with possible failures. These resources are thus considered as unreliable ones in our article. Normally;  unreliable resources may fail unexpectedly. Their occurrences can lead a system to stagnation;  causing unnecessary downtime;  and bringing economic loss to enterprises. To resolve such stagnation issues;  we develop a robust supervisory control policy to synthesize a robust liveness-enforcing supervisor for AMSs with assembly operations and unreliable resources. The supervisor can guarantee that a controlled system continues to progress without deadlock and blocking states even if some unreliable resources fail to work.
