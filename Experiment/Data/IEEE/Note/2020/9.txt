Cell manipulation and injection are theessential processes for most cell-based bioengineering applications. Cell manipulation enables not only cell transport andpattern building but also adhesion measurement both betweencells and the external matrix. On the other hand, in situcell injection is a significant process for cell-based medicinedevelopment and genetics research. Automated force-controlledcell manipulation and injection will greatly reduce the requirements of the userâ€™s experience and increase the efficiency andconsistency of the experiment. This paper introduces a method based on frequency shift feedback for obtaining highly accuratemonitoring of the interactions (at the piconewton level) betweencells and developing tools for automated and nondestructivemanipulation and injection. The research outcome provides aunique solution to achieve high-precision cell manipulation andin situ nanoinjection.
