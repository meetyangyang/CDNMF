The focus of this paper is to develop a probabilistic ensemble learning strategy based on the Bayesian network (PEL-BN) to diagnose different kinds of faults in industrial processes. The PEL-BN strategy can automatically select the base classifiers to establish the architecture of the Bayesian network. In this way;  the conclusions of these base classifiers can be effectively integrated to provide better diagnosis performance. In addition;  the proposed method is also a feasible technique for diagnosing MFs resulted from the joint effects of multiple faults.
