Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a crucial diagnostic tool for polyp detection and therapeutic monitoring;  thanks to its noninvasive;  user-friendly;  and nonpainful properties. A challenge in harnessing the enormous potential of the WCE to benefit the gastrointestinal (GI) patients is that it requires clinicians to analyze a huge number of images (about 50 000 images for each patient). We propose a novel automatic polyp recognition scheme;  namely;  DenseNet-UDCS model;  by addressing practical image unbalanced problem and small interclass variances and large intraclass differences in the data set. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate superior reliability and robustness of the proposed model compared to the other polyp recognition approaches. Our DenseNet-UDCS model can be further applied in the clinical practice to provide valuable diagnosis information for GI disease recognition and precision medicine.
