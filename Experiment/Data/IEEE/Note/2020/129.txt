This article presents a methodology for automatic estimation of buildings status in the aftermath of a natural disaster;  such as an earthquake. It focuses on using low-cost inertial sensors;  such as accelerometers;  to sense buildings' vibrations and then applying machine learning algorithms to detect damage. Utilizing the convolutional network approach;  the proposed methods detect the building damage state with high accuracy. Since this article focuses on using cheap sensors;  the cost of deploying a sensor network to monitor buildings is reduced significantly. Deploying this network enables rescue and reconnaissance teams to have a clear view of the most vulnerable structures.
