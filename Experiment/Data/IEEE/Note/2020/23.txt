This article presents a method forcontrolling the acceleration of a multi-rotor accurately under thepresence of translational force disturbance. Unlike the existingmethods, the new signal conversion technique that considers thedynamics of the multi-rotor in the process of converting thetarget translational acceleration signal to the target roll, pitch,and thrust signal enables a more accurate translational forcecontrol. The DOB structure applied to the translational forcecontrol system overcomes the acceleration control performancedeterioration caused by external translational force disturbance.Through the combination of the two techniques, the accelerationof the multi-rotor can be accurately controlled not only in thenominal environment but also in the presence of translationalforce disturbance.
