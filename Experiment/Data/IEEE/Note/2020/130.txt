This work deals with bike repositioning in bike-sharing systems (BSSs) during peak hours;  which has major significance in the efficient operation of such systems. It builds a multiobjective optimization model and solves it through a modified multiobjective artificial bee colony algorithm. The existing single-objective optimization methods fail to solve the concerned problem. This work can find the optimal routes of the repositioning vehicles along with the number of desired parked bikes of corresponding stations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is highly effective and can greatly and readily help decision-makers better manage the BSS of a practical size.
