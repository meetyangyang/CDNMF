The efficiency of the parking assignment is critical to the parking management systems in order to provide the best parking guides. This article investigates the cost minimization problem for parking assignment while balancing parking demand among multiple parking lots (PLs). Previous parking assignment approaches do not jointly investigate the cost of parking and the cost of PL utilization. Therefore;  they can fail to the local congestion problem caused by a large number of vehicles driving toward the same PL. In this article;  a new method that considers both of minimizing parking expenses and balancing parking demand is proposed. It is obtained by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based proposal that distributively solves a constrained optimization problem. Based on the experimental results;  the ADMM-based algorithm outperforms the matching-based algorithm and the greedy algorithm in terms of the balancing parking demand and reducing parking expenses. The proposed method can be readily implemented in real-world industrial PLs. In the future work where parking assignments for electric vehicles are needed;  our proposed mechanism can then be extended to solve the balanced electricity overload multiple charging stations.
