This paper was motivated by solving the problem of registering two or multiple point sets. Most existing approaches generally use only the positional information associated with each point and thus lack robustness to noise and outliers. This paper suggests a new robust method that also adopts the normal vectors associated with each point. The registration problem is cast into a maximum-likelihood (ML) problem and solved under the expectationâ€“maximization (EM) framework. Closed-form solutions to estimating parameters in both expectation and maximization steps are provided in this paper. We have demonstrated through extensive experiments that the proposed registration algorithm achieves improved accuracy, robustness to noise and outliers, and faster convergence speed.
