This article deals with a schedulingproblem arising from a steelmakingâ€“continuous casting processin steel manufacturing. It integrates ladles allocation into thescheduling problem to reduce the energy consumption as muchas possible. Such a problem in the existing work is handled,respectively, and its solutions tend to cause much energy wasteand some mismatched plans. This article takes complex technological constraints into full account and minimizes the maximumjob completion time, idle time of equipment, and waiting timeof jobs. It establishes a mixed integer mathematical model andproposes a hybrid algorithm that combines scatter search andmixed integer programming to solve it. The extensive resultsdemonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively solve thestudied scheduling problem. The obtained solution gives decisionmakers some desired reference to determine a right schedulewhen an actual production process is conducted.
