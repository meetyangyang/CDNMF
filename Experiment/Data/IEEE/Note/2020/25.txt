Additive manufacturing (AM) systems possess an intrinsic capability for one-of-a-kind manufacturing of a vast variety of shapes across a wide spectrum of constituent processes. Learning how to control geometric shape accuracy in a comprehensive manner for an AM system is vital to its operation. This task is challenging due to constraints on the number of test shapes that can be manufactured and user efforts that can be devoted for learning and predicting geometric errors of different sets of shapes and AM processes. This article presents an automated machine learning methodology for comprehensive learning and prediction of geometric errors in an AM system based on a limited number of test shapes manufactured under different processes. Several case studies serve to validate the potential of our methodology to learn effective geometric accuracy control policies for general AM systems in practice.
