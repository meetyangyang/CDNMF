This paper is motivated by the problem of avoiding unexpected situations that may cause industrial accidents in mobile robot systems. Practitioners need to have a control model of the system in order to solve this problem. Existing approaches usually find constraints of a mobile robot system while modeling, which increases the number of iterations. This paper suggests a new approach to find all constraints and then builds a control model for mobile robot systems systematically. With a control model, practitioners can obtain allowed or not allowed operations so as to avoid unexpected situations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach.
