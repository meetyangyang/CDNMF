This article deals with a state-dependent minimum variance hedging problem. It combines a time-varying Markov regime switching with dynamic conditional correlation generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity named DCC-GARCH to construct a new hedging model and estimates a state-dependent hedging ratio. Empirical results from commodity futures hedging show that introducing TVTP into the DCC-GARCH model can effectively reduce portfolio risk and provide better hedging performance than other traditional models;  including Markov regime switching DCC-GARCH with a fixed transition probability;  DCC-GARCH;  ordinary least squares;  na√Øve hedging strategies;  and unhedged spots. Thus;  this article is of guiding significance for hedgers to fully learn the hedging rules of futures market and avoid the spots price risk.
