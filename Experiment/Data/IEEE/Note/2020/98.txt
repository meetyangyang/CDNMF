This paper is motivated by resource allocation problems in congestion networks where strategic users behave selfishly and aim at optimizing their own individual utility in the absence of a central controller. Compared with the centralized algorithms of poor reliability and scalability;  game-theoretic control provides a promising distributed approach for resource allocation. In the game-theoretic framework;  the existence and seeking of the desired solution are important issues. In this paper;  a novel model is established to extend the utility functions space guaranteeing the existence of the solution. The developed utility design is used to capture users' different sensitivities to the effects of the network system. Simultaneously;  it is more meaningful from the view of engineering to design the utility functions so that the desirable behavior is reachable. We also give an explicit scheme to seek the desired solution. The proposed model is finally applied to the service chain composition problem in NFV;  of which the aim is to find the best service chain of users that accommodates their individual requirements. The proposed model shows reliable and effective.
