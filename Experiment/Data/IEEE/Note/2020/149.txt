This article studies a scheduling problem for die attach and wire bonding stages of a semiconductor packaging line. Due to the variabilities in production requirements, the number of available machines, and initial setup status, it is challenging for a scheduler to produce high-quality schedules within a specific time limit using existing approaches. In this article, a new scheduling method using reinforcement learning is proposed to enhance the robustness against the variabilities while achieving performance improvements. To verify the robustness of the proposed method, neural networks (NNs) trained on small-scale scheduling problems are used to solve large-scale scheduling problems. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches while requiring a short computation time. Furthermore, the trained NN performs well in solving unseen real-world scale problems even under stochastic processing time, suggesting the viability of the proposed method for real-world semiconductor packaging lines.
