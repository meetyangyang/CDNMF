This article was motivated by the highoperating costs of VR theme parks as the VR industry grew.At current VR theme parks, human attendants provide one-onone services to their customers on how to operate the simulator.Therefore, we automate the abovementioned procedure to reduceoperating costs and increase turnover rate and ticket sales at thesame time. In addition, we also seek to improve customer satisfaction as well as automatic operation. In order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, the proposed robotic attendant uses cameraimages to obtain the age and gender of the customer and uses thegame data to track game progress. Then, the robotic attendantprovides customer-specific voice services using personal information. Experimental results show that the personalized servicesprovided by the robotic attendant improve customer satisfaction.
