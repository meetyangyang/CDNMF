Process data analysis methods play an increasing important role in system maintenance and process monitoring in real industrial processes. The focus of this paper is to develop a fault diagnosis strategy with dual analysis of common and specific nonstationary fault variations. The proposed strategy can automatically describe the relationships between different fault classes using process data without complex mechanism knowledge. By exploring the relationship information between different faults;  more accurate diagnosis models can be developed. Besides;  the proposed strategy is a feasible technique for the nonstationary problem of complicated and varied industrial processes.
