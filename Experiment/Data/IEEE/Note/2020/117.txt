Motivated by the problem of decentralized dispatch of multi-microgrids in grid-connected mode, we consider the online decentralized operation and pay special attention to the grid tie-line power fluctuation. This problem is challenging due to the randomness of the renewable power generation, the global constraints about multiple microgrids, and the correlation among stages. We model the decentralized dispatch problem as a rolling horizon Dec-MDP and provide an approximate solution method, namely, alternately minimizing among different microgrids at the online stage and calculating approximate value functions in the offline preparation process. The approximate value functions make the online decision turn out to be a single-stage decentralized decision problem. Online decision calculation based on delayed communication is to guarantee all the microgrids to start conducting an action immediately while receiving the information related to them. We hope this paper brings insight onto the tie-line power fluctuation stabilization while multiple microgrids connecting to the same point of interconnection.
