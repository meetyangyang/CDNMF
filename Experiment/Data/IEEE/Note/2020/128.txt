This work is motivated by the increasing popularity of web-based appointment platforms. Considering the fact of limited physician resources;  we address the issue of how to recommend physicians for patients in a personalized and real-time way on web-based appointment platform;  in order to improve the matching degree between physicians and patients as well as the resource allocation efficiency. To the best of our knowledge;  we propose one of the initial methods to recommend personalized physician rankings in dynamic environments with limited resources. We construct a specific model and propose algorithms to make physician recommendation decision;  which performs better than other benchmark approaches based on the numerical analysis;  and the case study with real-world system data indicates our method's capability of solving the practical problem. Our method is robust enough for the reason that the model allows arbitrary arrival pattern. The model and methods are specifically designed for the web-based appointment platforms;  but it can also be easily applied in other application scenarios based on visual web pages;  such as e-commerce.
