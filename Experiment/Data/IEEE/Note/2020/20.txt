This paper focuses on designing andevaluating a real-time fault diagnosis application in an industrialsetup. To this end, this paper also tackles the problem ofdeveloping a methodology for implementing advanced state-ofthe-art fault detection techniques in real machinery, followingindustry standards and using a modern informatics architecture.The application here developed uses a statistical data-drivenfault diagnosis technique, hence it requires a training stageusing historical data to learn patterns and estimate parameters.A proof of concept in fault diagnosis for industrial motors isgiven; however, it should be noted that both the methodologyand the deployed architecture are scalable and flexible enoughto facilitate the implementation in other industrial environments.The implementation here presented was deployed using onlyopen-source tools, which allows evaluating this tool withoutincurring in high expenses.
