/i>\nâ€”The hot rolling batch scheduling process is crucial in linking the casting and rolling processes of iron and steel productions. In the rolling batch scheduling problem of CSP;  there is no buffer between the casting and rolling processes;  and virtual strips must be added to satisfy production constraints. Most rolling batch scheduling methods do not consider the addition of virtual strips. In this paper;  we mathematically characterize the hot rolling batch scheduling problem in CSP with flexible production constraints. We then show how the optimal approach and artificial bee colony algorithm are designed. Finally;  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by comparisons with other well-known metaheuristic algorithms. This paper can be extended to other hot rolling batch scheduling problems with buffers and hybrid flowshop scheduling problems.
