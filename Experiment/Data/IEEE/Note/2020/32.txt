This article was done under the industrial project Flecto. It aims at solving the assembly/disassembly task for a rod while satisfying the elasticity parameters of its material in a digital mockup. For industrial applications;  the resolution time is a critical point. On the one hand;  probabilistic motion planning methods require to efficiently build a roadmap of valid rod configurations. On the other hand;  accurate rod modeling implies the use of a simulator based on the finite-element method (FEM). Nevertheless;  the very large size of the roadmap that leads to a high number of calls to the simulator is conflicting with the high computational cost of FEM simulation. To overcome this problem;  one solution is to reduce the number of simulator calls. This can be achieved by sampling the free space with an efficient parameterization and by limiting the use of the simulator to roadmap extension in the free space or in the contact space. We introduce heuristics based on contact information returned by the simulator to significantly reduce the computational time. One of the main advantages of our algorithm is that it does not require any tuning phase for each scenario. Although we do not solve the more general gripper manipulation planning problem;  this approach could be used as a first step before computing the grippers' motion. In the framework of our project;  we did not consider disassembling operations implying undoing rod knots. Consequently;  we do not consider friction in our approach (friction simulation is necessary to handle knots).
