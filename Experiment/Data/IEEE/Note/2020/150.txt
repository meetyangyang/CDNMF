The varying industrial conditions (domains) can lead to the degradation of diagnostic performance as the distribution can change from the source domain to the target domain. The focus of this article is to develop a finegrained adversarial network-based domain adaptation (FANDA) strategy to diagnose different kinds of faults across the domains. The proposed FANDA algorithm can reduce the distribution discrepancy of both the global domains and each fault class across the domains automatically. The training procedure is completed using an adversarial way, driving the learned feature representations to be transferable across two domains. Thus, the fault classifier learned on the source domain can be applied to the target domain directly. It is noted that common deep network architectures can be embedded into the FANDA framework, and thus, this article is suitable for carrying out cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks in diverse advanced manufacturing applications.
