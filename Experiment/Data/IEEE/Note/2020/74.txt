Attitude estimation using magnetic;  angular rate;  and gravity (MARG) sensors is very common for ground;  air;  and underwater vehicles. The novel findings in this article aim to give the engineers a brand new perspective on the related filter design according to the widely employed gradient-descent algorithm (GDA) method. Some specific techniques;  e.g.;  optimal adaptive law of the designed scheme;  will also bring flexibility to the implementation with multiple considerations of object motions.
