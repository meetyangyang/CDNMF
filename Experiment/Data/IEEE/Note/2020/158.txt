This article is motivated by our collaboration with an HHC company in Shanghai, China. The company delivers medical, paramedical, and social services to customers in their homes to help them improve their clinical and psychological conditions without hospital stays. In practice, customers require long-term and periodic service (e.g., weekly), which may last many months or even years. HHC companies have to assign a combination of service days and at least one server to each customer. Due to specific constraints in practical operations and the large scale of the practical problems (e.g., 1000â€“2000 customers) of the HHC in this article, the server assignment problem is challenging to the HHC company. The algorithm presented in this article takes into account the special constraints of the HHC and is able to solve the large-scale problem in a reasonable time span. The algorithm can be used to help decision-makers assign combinations of service days and servers to customers with the objective of balancing the workloads among servers.
