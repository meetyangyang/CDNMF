This article was motivated by the limitations of existing deep learning technologies for analyzing 3-D laser scanning data. This technology enables robots to infer what the surroundings are;  which is closely linked to semantic mapping and navigation tasks. Previous deep neural networks have seldom been used in robotic systems since they require a large amount of memory and fast computation power to apply dense 3-D operations. This article presents a sparse 3-D-Convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-time point cloud classification by exploiting the sparsity of 3-D data. This framework requires no GPUs. The practicality of the proposed method is verified on data sets gathered from different platforms and sensors. The proposed network can be adopted for other classification tasks with laser sensors.
