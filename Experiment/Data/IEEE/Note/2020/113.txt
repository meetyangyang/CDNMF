In automated manufacturing systems (AMSs);  resource failures are common. Their occurrences can lead a system to stagnation;  which can cause unnecessary downtime and bring vast economic loss for enterprises. To resolve such stagnation issues;  a great number of robust supervisory control policies have been proposed for AMSs with unreliable resources. These policies guarantee that a controlled system can continue to progress without deadlock and blocking states even if some unreliable resources fail to work. By a thorough review of existing robust supervisory control policies for AMSs with unreliable resources;  this paper compares and analyzes these policies in terms of their structural complexity;  behavioral permissiveness;  and computational complexity. The goal of this paper is to provide a reference source in the area to help researchers and practitioners choose a suitable method for solving industrial application problems that are subject to resource failures.
