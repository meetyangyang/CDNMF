- Multiple mobile robots;  especially when operating as a formation;  are able to perform tasks that are beyond the capabilities of individual robots. Existing formation control approaches neglect some realistic limitations of mobile robots;  such as battery failure;  limited transportation capacity;  and maneuverability;  to name a few. This article was motivated by these realistic limitations of mobile robots when operating in formation;  and it suggests a new approach for navigation of such robots by docking some (or all) of these robots to each other and pursue a variety of goals. The goal includes autonomous docking;  formation keeping/switching;  and collision avoidance in dynamic environments. We include robot dynamics and system uncertainties in our algorithm and provide a robust control methodology. Therefore;  the developed methodologies in this article can be adopted in real applications that require robots to be supplied with sufficient battery or having a large payload capacity;  e.g.;  agricultural robotics.
