The motivation of this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient path planning algorithm for practical applications such as autonomous driving;  warehouse robot;  and countless others. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However;  the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality initial path and accelerate the convergence speed;  we propose the NRRT*. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and achieves better performance. The NRRT* can be also applied to other sampling-based algorithms for improved results in different applications.
