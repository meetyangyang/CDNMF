This paper uses historic operating data and weather forecasting to improve the temperature tracking in multizone buildings. The proposed approach exploits the inherent passivity property of the building thermal model and, therefore, does not require the accurate model identification prior to implementation. As a result, this method may be conveniently retrofitted to any existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, provided that the system is capable of adjusting the heat input (e.g., by controlling the supply air flow rate) and storing temperature sensor data. The algorithm uses weather prediction to match the upcoming ambient temperature variation with those experienced in the past. With the past operating data (control input and resulting temperature error) from the matched day, a feed-forward control is iteratively updated to improve the tracking performance. This paper includes the experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in our test bed, and simulation examples to provide the insight into the real-world implementation. This approach may be extended to other external heat sources exhibiting repetitive patterns, e.g., occupancy, equipment, and solar input.
