This work is motivated by the neglect of safety in existing controller design in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI);  which exists in industry and services;  such as assembly and medical care. It is considerably required in the controller design for rigorously handling constraints. Therefore;  in this article;  we propose a novel admittance-based human-robot interaction controller. The developed controller has the following functionalities: 1) ensuring reference trajectory remaining in the constrained task space: a differentiable reference trajectory is shaped by the desired admittance model and a soft saturation function; 2) solving uncertainties of robotic dynamics: a learning approach based on radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is involved in controller design; and 3) ensuring the end-effector of the manipulator remaining in the constrained task space: different from other barrier Lyapunov function (BLF);  integral BLF (IBLF) is proposed to constrain system output directly rather than tracking error;  which may be more convenient for controller designers. The controller can be potentially applied in many areas. First;  it can be used in the rehabilitation robot to avoid injuring the patient by limiting the motion. Second;  it can ensure the end-effector of the industrial manipulator in a prescribed task region. In some industrial tasks;  dangerous or damageable tools are mounted on the end-effector;  and it will hurt humans and bring damage to the robot when the end-effector is out of the prescribed task region. Third;  it may bring a new idea to the designed controller for avoiding collisions in pHRI when collisions occur in the prescribed trajectory of end-effector.
