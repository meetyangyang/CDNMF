Fault diagnosis based on discrete-event systems has been successfully used in several fields of applications;  such as transportation;  telecommunication;  manufacturing;  and so on. At the design stage of a system;  the diagnosability needs to be held;  which refers to the ability to determine if the system can detect the fault after its occurrence. Therefore;  the diagnosability is a critical property due to its importance in terms of safety of an industrial system. In order to allow an industrial exploitation of diagnosability analysis;  this article proposes reduction rules;  which make it possible to reduce a priori the size of the LPN model of an industrial system.
