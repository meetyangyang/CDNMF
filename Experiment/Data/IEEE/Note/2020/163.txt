This article proposes a method of defect image generation to address the lack of industrial defect images. Traditional defect recognition methods have two disadvantages: different types of defects require different algorithms and handcrafted features are deficient. Defect recognition using deep learning can solve the above problems. However;  deep learning requires a plethora of images;  and the number of industrial defect images cannot meet this requirement. We propose a new defect image-generation method called SDGAN to generate a defect image data set that balances diversity and authenticity. In practice;  we employ a large number of defect-free images to generate a large number of defect images using our method to expand the industry defect-free image data set. Then;  the augmented defect data set is used to build a deep-learning defect recognition model. Experiments show that the accuracy of defect recognition can be significantly improved by building a deep-learning defect recognition model using the augmented data set. Therefore;  deep learning can achieve excellent performance in defect recognition with a limited number of defect images.
