This article was motivated by the vision-based motion control problem of mobile robots in uncalibrated environments. Existing vision-based motion control approaches for nonholonomic mobile robots generally depend on offline precise/coarse or online numerical/adaptive calibration of the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and require precise or coarse knowledge of the camera in their implementation. This article presents a novel calibration-free image-based trajectory tracking control scheme;  which can be implemented easily in real environments without any offline or online calibration of the camera parameters and can be used to efficiently control the motion of nonholonomic mobile robots with an arbitrarily placed and truly unknown overhead camera. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve satisfactory trajectory tracking control performance despite the lack of any knowledge about the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and the presence of unknown camera lens distortions;  and hence;  can provide a simple but efficient solution to the vision-based motion control problem of nonholonomic mobile robots.
