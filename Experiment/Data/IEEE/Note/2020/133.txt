Process optimal control and condition monitoring are vital for the stability and economic operation of industrial processes;  and the basis of them is to quickly establish an accurate and reliable process performance prediction model. Traditional methods for developing process performance prediction models often require a large amount of complex calculations and rich process data;  which is time- and cost-consuming. In particular;  these methods focus only on the current process to be modeled;  while ignoring the existing and similar process information;  wasting process information. This article presents a minimum-cost modeling method for nonlinear industrial processes;  which can make full use of information on multiple similar existing processes to assist the modeling of a new process to reduce the modeling cost of the new process. Specifically;  a multimodel migration strategy including Bayesian model averaging is designed to migrate useful information from similar processes to the new process. The nested Latin hypercube design (NLHD) is employed to collect the necessary minimum data on the new nonlinear process. By applying the proposed approach to the industrial nonlinear process;  it is possible to achieve the accurate performance prediction model with minimal new process data.
