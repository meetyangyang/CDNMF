;/i>-This article was motivated by the visual localization problem in dynamic environments. Visual localization is well applied in many robotic fields such as path planning and exploration as the basic capability for a mobile robot. In the GPS-denied environments;  one robot needs to localize itself through perceiving the unknown environment based on a visual sensor. In real-world scenes;  the existence of the moving objects will significantly degrade the localization accuracy;  which makes the robot implementation unreliable. In this article;  an SMR model is designed to handle this problem. Once receiving a frame;  the proposed model divides it into dynamic and static regions through a Bayesian framework. The dynamic regions are eliminated;  while the static ones are maintained and fed into a feature-based visual SLAM system for further visual localization. The proposed method greatly improves the localization accuracy in dynamic environments and guarantees the robustness for robotic implementation.
