Computer simulation models are often used to represent the behavior of complex engineered systems;  such as automobiles;  aircraft;  and wind turbines. Although running computer simulations allows analyzing the performance of these systems;  the simulations can still be computationally costly (e.g.;  hours of runtime for numerically solving a large number of differential equations in one simulation);  which makes the performance analysis task challenging. It is important to design an innovative simulation process that replaces the original expensive simulation models by cheap-to-build surrogate models;  and at the same time;  minimize the computational costs for building the surrogate models. The new method developed in this article allows experimental designers to run batch sequential iterations and run these iterations in parallel. This;  in engineering practice;  will help meet the need for long and complex experimental designs scenarios in a parallel computing environment;  where the computer “up time” (or runtime) needs to be maximized to save time and ultimately;  money. Cost analysis results from an industrial problem involving the inverse design of wind turbine blades suggest that the proposed method reduces the computational costs by up to approximately 31% over an existing method.
