Control of “physical human-robot interaction” can be achieved by the mechanical parts of the variable stiffness actuator (VSA). However;  the mechanical construction for stiffness variation may limit the capacity to achieve low output stiffness and fast stiffness variation in speed. These limitations may become more evident in the assistance/rehabilitation robot applications. To overcome these limitations;  the impedance control scheme can be employed to achieve a programmable impedance range and impedance variation speed. This control scheme has been widely applied on the fixed-compliance joint but lacks a way to be implemented on the VSA joint because of its existing capacity to control the impedance with the mechanical construction. This article presents a novel application of the impedance-controlled VSA used on a lower limb robot. We describe how to adjust the actuator stiffness to cooperatively work with the adaptive impedance control scheme. Based on our approach;  the robot with the impedance-controlled VSA joint can extend the capacity of bandwidth and low output impedance. This is an improvement on the impedance-controlled fixed-compliance joint. The cooperative control framework presented here was tested on an exoskeleton system with two healthy test persons and is also applicable to other actuator prototypes. Future research aims to employ this system for actual patient training.
