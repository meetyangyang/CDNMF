In the traditional fault diagnosis approaches, in order to design a diagnoser for a discrete-event system, it is necessary to obtain its model, including both faultfree and postfault behaviors. Since, in general, complex systems are formed by several modules, components, or subsystems, then the composed system model may have a large number of states, which leads to diagnosers, obtained by using the traditional techniques, with a huge number of states, increasing the computational cost for their implementation. In order to circumvent this problem, we propose in this article the implementation of a diagnoser that is computed from the fault-free behavior models of the system components, avoiding the direct use of the composed system model for diagnosis. We also present a decentralized architecture in order to enable its use for large systems where the sensor information is distributed. The verification of the diagnosability of the system considering the fault diagnosis scheme proposed in this article is applied to a didactic automated plant.
