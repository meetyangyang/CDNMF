This article is motivated by the issue of the following predefined paths for magnetically driven helical microswimmers in 3-D space. The proposed closed-loop controller employs the error model in 3-D space to formulate the control law according to an orientation-compensation model learned by neural networks. It is demonstrated that the helical microswimmer is able to follow different paths in 3-D space with submillimeter accuracy using the proposed control scheme.
