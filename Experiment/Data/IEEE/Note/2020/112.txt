As the circuit widths shrink down, residual gases and particles within chambers after processing wafers become more critical to wafer quality. In fact, leading fabs are now cleaning a chamber for each new wafer in order to reduce such quality risk. We propose a new practical method for scheduling tools that can significantly reduce such quality risk caused by wafer waiting within chambers after processing.
