In this article;  we propose a mathematical programming-based approach to decide when the tools in wafer fabs have to be qualified for a certain family. These decisions have high practical relevance because qualifications are expensive and time-consuming. A dispatching scheme to implement the qualification decisions is designed. The overall approach is assessed in a rolling horizon setting using a simulation model of a large-scale wafer fab. An appropriate tradeoff between production and qualification goals can be achieved using the proposed approach.
