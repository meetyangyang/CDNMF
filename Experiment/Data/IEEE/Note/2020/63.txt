Underwater target tracking is aimed toacquire precise location and achieve sustainable monitoring for atarget. It has important practical significance to enhance marineobserving ability. Currently, the most favorable carrier for underwater communication is still the acoustic wave. However, due tothe unique characteristics of acoustic communication, the tracking schemes developed for the terrestrial environment cannotbe directly applied to underwater acoustic sensor networks.With this as motivation, we develop an energy-efficient trackingapproach for underwater targets. The tracking approach developed in this article exploits timestamp measurement, consensus fusion strategy, and duty-cycle mechanism to capture the uniquecharacteristics of acoustic communication. To better use thisapproach for target tracking, two factors should be highlighted:1) the clocks between target and sensors are not required to besynchronized and 2) the sensor nodes are not always demandedto retain the active mode. Simultaneously, it is more meaningfulfrom the view of marine engineering to design the control andcommunication platforms. Simulation and experimental resultssuggest that the proposed tracking method is feasible and hassuperior performance as compared with the existing methods.Hopefully, our tracking strategy can provide valuable theoreticaland technical support guidance to the practicing marine engineerfor the co-design of control and communication.
