Process monitoring is important in guaranteeing process safety and improving product quality. Large amounts of unlabeled process data with multiple operation modes generally exist in industrial processes. Labeling these data is difficult or costly. Hence, this paper presents a VBGMM-CCA method for monitoring multimode processes. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it automatically identifies the number of operation modes in historical data and clusters the data. Then, local CCA monitors are established to model the process input and output relationships. During online monitoring, the running-on operation mode is identified through a density function, and the process status is evaluated by the corresponding CCA monitor. A probabilistic monitoring index is also developed to increase the robustness of the monitoring. In comparison with the results of conventional methods, the monitoring results of the proposed approach are more reliable and informative because the process status and the type of the detected fault are presented.
