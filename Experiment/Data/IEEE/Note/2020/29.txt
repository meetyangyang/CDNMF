Pulp quality control in the refining process plays a critical role in the optimization of product quality and energy saving in the pulping and papermaking processes. Different from the conventional control method based on the mean and variance of the fiber length;  a novel data-driven predictive PDF control method is proposed for the non-Gaussian stochastic distribution dynamic characteristics of the fiber length;  which is used to achieve the desired PDF shaping of fiber length distribution. This kind of novel control method includes the control of the traditional mean and variance of the fiber length in some sense and has applications that are more extensive.
