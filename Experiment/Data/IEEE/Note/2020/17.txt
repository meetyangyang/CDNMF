This paper presents several task assignment algorithms for the precedence-constrained package deliveryfor the team of a truck and a micro drone. The truck can carrythe drone moving in a street network, while the drone completesthe last-mile package deliveries. The practical contributions ofthis paper are fourfold. First, the precedence constraints on theordering of the customers to be served are considered, whichenables complex logistic scheduling for customers prioritizedaccording to their urgency or importance. Second, the packagedelivery optimization problem is shown to be NP-hard, whichclearly shows the need for creative approximation algorithmsto solve the problem. Third, the constructed lower bound onthe optimal time to serve all the customers helps to clarify for practitioners the limiting performance of a feasible solution.Fourth, the proposed task assignment algorithms are efficientand can be adapted for real scenarios.
