The reputation models adopted by current commercial platforms, such as Amazon, eBay, and Taobao,not only suffer heavily from unfair rating but also resilient tothe changes in services. To address the problems simultaneously,we design and implement a hybrid model that continuously monitors received ratings and aggregates the reputation valuein a self-adaptive way. Our model first fits received fair ratingsusing the Bayesian linear regression approach and captures thedistribution of fair ratings; it then filters out unfair ratingsleveraging hypothesis testing. Finally, to sensitively respond thedynamic service changes, the dynamic sliding window algorithmin our model shifts the rating collection window into a new oneand discards outdated ratings, reputation value is aggregatedin the new window to mitigate the influence of obsolete ratings.Extensive experiments are conducted on widely used scenarios todemonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposedmodel.
