This article was motivated by the problem of the detection of small fruits for yield estimation but it also applies to the detection of other small objects. Existing approaches to fruit detection experience difficulty in detecting small fruits and the overall detection accuracy suffers as a result. This article suggests a novel approach to detect fruits of all sizes by using a multiple classifier fusion strategy in the stage of fruit localization. In the learning of the classifiers, multilevel features of fruits are extracted. In addition, we achieve classifier diversity through the analysis of the correlation of classification probabilities. The diversity of classifiers also helps improve the performance of fruit localization. Using experiments on real fruit tree images, we show that the suggested approach is feasible on orange detection of various sites in different seasons. As a future work, we will integrate the suggested algorithm into a fruit yield estimation system and test it online.
