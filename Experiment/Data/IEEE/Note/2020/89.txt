Workload prediction plays an important role in constructing scalable and green distributed cloud data centers. This paper presents a novel and fundamental methodology to achieve accuracy and fast learning for workload prediction. It develops an integrated prediction approach that combines the Savitzky–Golay filter and wavelet decomposition with stochastic configuration networks to predict workload at the next time slot. In order to establish a fine prediction model for the obtained information while achieving better prediction results and faster learning speed, this paper proposes an integrated method, SGWS, to build a prediction model of a task time series and determine its optimal model parameters. The experimental results in the real-world data set show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods in predicting the large-scale task time series. The proposed approach can aid the design and optimization of industrial cloud data centers and practitioners’ prediction of different types of task time series.
