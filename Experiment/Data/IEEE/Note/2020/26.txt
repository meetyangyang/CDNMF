In conventional planar-layer-based 3-Dprinting systems, supporting structures need to be added atthe bottom of large overhanging regions to prevent material collapse. Supporting structures used in single-material 3-Dprinting technologies have three major problems: being difficultto remove, introducing surface damage, and wasting material.This article introduces a method to improve 3-D printing byadding rotation during the manufacturing process. To keep thehardware system relatively inexpensive, the hardware, calleda multi-directional 3-D printing system, only needs to provideunsynchronized rotations. In this system, models are subdividedinto different regions, and then, the regions are printed indifferent directions. We develop a general volume decompositionalgorithm for effectively reducing the area that needs supporting structures. When supporting structures cannot be eliminated,we provide a supplementary algorithm for generating supportscompatible with multi-directional 3-D printing. Our method canspeed up the process of 3-D printing by saving time in producingand removing supports.
