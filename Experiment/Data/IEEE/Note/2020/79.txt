This article proposes an efficient heuristic algorithm for assigning items to pods in a robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS) so that items ordered together frequently are put into the same pod. Computational results with 10-500 items show that the gaps from upper bounds are very small on average. For cases where the similarity values between items change or their estimation is not accurate due to the fluctuations in demand;  a reoptimization heuristic algorithm that alters the original assignment is developed. The experimental results show that the reoptimization algorithm is robust when perturbation levels are approximately 40%-50% of the original similarity values with much less computation times. We believe that this research work can be very helpful for operating the RMFS efficiently.
