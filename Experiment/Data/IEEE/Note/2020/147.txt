This article investigates an airline crew rostering problem (ACRP) originated from a renowned Chinese airline. The goal is to effectively utilize its manpower resources. ACRP has various kinds of rules, constraints, and objectives. It is generally very difficult to model a practical problem by using explicit formula sets. We thereby provide an implicit mathematical model to define the problem. Based on this model, concise yet effective heuristic approaches are devised to construct rosters automatically. They can handle the case that has more than 1000 attendants, 2000 pairings, and 12 000 flight tasks. We believe that the proposed approaches can serve as kinds of generic frameworks for practical and large-scale ACRPs.
