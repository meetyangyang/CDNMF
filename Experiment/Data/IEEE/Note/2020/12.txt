This paper was motivated by the observation of sensor degradation in wastewater treatment plantsbut the developed approach also applies to other systems suchas manufacturing systems, chemical plants, and pharmaceuticalfactories, where sensors are dedicated to a long-time operationin a harsh environment. This paper investigates the impact ofsensor degradation on CBM and suggests that the effect ofsensor degradation should be carefully addressed while making maintenance decisions. Otherwise, it will lead to a suboptimalmaintenance decision and increase the operating cost. An optimalmaintenance decision, which contains the optimal inspectioninterval and reliability threshold, is achieved via minimizingthe long-run cost rate. In the presence of measurement noiseand intrinsic uncertainty from degradation, a stochastic filteringapproach is employed to estimate the system and sensor state.Based on the estimated states and the calculated reliability,a dynamic maintenance decision is obtained at each inspection.This paper can be further extended considering non-Gaussiannoise and alternative degradation processes.
