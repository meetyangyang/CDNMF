The state-of-the-art visual-guided robotic technology in industry usually requires system calibration;  which is often costly;  vulnerable;  and challenging for ordinary workers. In our previous work;  we offered an uncalibrated visual servo method based on projective homography named projective homography-based uncalibrated visual servoing (PHUVS);  which is suitable for plug and play application for eye-in-hand robot visual servo tasks. However;  PHUVS suffers from some defects;  including undesirable 3-D space motion and local convergence. In this article;  we proposed the trajectory planning method along with a modified PHUVS controller to improve the original one from the disadvantages mentioned earlier. This planning method is also calibration-free. With pure image information;  a straight-line path in translational motion along with minimal geodesic in rotary motion can be achieved. This approach is capable of extending the range of applications for uncalibrated visual servo technology in robotic tasks;  such as assembling;  painting;  and robotic machining.
