This paper is motivated to develop an automatic control method to realize the 3-D simultaneous assembly of multiple objects under simultaneous feeding scheme, which can strategically achieve the highest efficiency compared with the serial feeding scheme. The peg-hole fitting is modeled as a stochastic state-transition process, which needs to be pretrained with experience offline. In practical task, the multiple objects are first aligned in 3-D space in six degrees of freedom (DOFs) based on the microscopic vision. Then, the contact states on the multiple contacting surfaces during the assembly process are described as multivariate Gaussian probabilistic distribution. Finally, the motions of each object are planned based on the state-transition confidence and will be evaluated once taken. Motions may be withdrawn if the confidence is unacceptable, while action withdrawing rate is a critical assessment factor of the proposed method.
