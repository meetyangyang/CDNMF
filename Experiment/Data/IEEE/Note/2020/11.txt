This paper describes a novel method called MOELS for minimizing both costs and makespan when deploying a workflow into a cloud datacenter. MOELS seamlessly combines a list scheduling heuristic and an evolutionary algorithm to have complementary advantages. It is compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms MOHEFT (multiobjective heterogeneous earliest finish time) and EMS-C (evolutionary multiobjective scheduling for cloud) in the simulation experiments. The results show that the average hypervolume value from MOELS is 3.42% higher than that of MOHEFT;  and 2.27% higher than that of EMS-C. The runtime that MOELS requires rises moderately as a workflow size increases.
