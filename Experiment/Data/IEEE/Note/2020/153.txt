Economic globalization brings intense competition among manufacturing enterprises. The key to success in this competitive climate is a prompt response to rapidly changing market demands with high-quality products. Variation reduction is essential for improving process efficiency and product quality. Existing variation source identification approaches generally assume that the amount of measurement data is larger than that of the possible variation sources. We propose a method to identify the process variation sources with limited measurement capability. Moreover;  we provide a tool to apply the domain knowledge on the possible variations in the manufacturing processes. The proposed method is flexible and can be adjusted according to the confidence level of the practitioners' empirical knowledge. The experiments have shown that our method possesses advantageous features in detecting variation sources and estimating the size of variations.
