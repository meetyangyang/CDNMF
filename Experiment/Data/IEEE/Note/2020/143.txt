Alarm floods are referred to as the phenomena that there are too many alarm events occurring in a short time period such that industrial plant operators cannot promptly handle the overwhelming alarm events. An alarm flood usually means the occurrence of some abnormalities causing negative effects on industrial plants. Hence;  it is desirable to predict the upcoming alarm event when several alarm events occur;  in order to take proactive actions to prevent a further deterioration or propagation of occurring abnormalities. This article proposes a new method to predict upcoming alarm events for a current alarm sequence based on the Bayesian estimators;  by exploiting similar historical alarm flood sequences in the prediction.
