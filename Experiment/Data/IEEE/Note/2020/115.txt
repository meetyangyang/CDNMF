In this paper, we tackle a practical metrology problem encountered in semiconductor manufacturing, namely, the design of a dynamic wafer measurement plan to monitor the accuracy of a process across the whole wafer surface. The measurement plan is called “dynamic,” since the measurement locations, which are drawn from a candidate set that provides coverage of the whole wafer, change at each process iteration. Our methodology addresses the challenge of finding an optimized tradeoff between the number of measurements performed on each wafer and the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved for the unmeasured areas on the wafer while, at the same time, for quality assurance purposes, ensuring that all locations on a wafer are visited in a finite number of process runs. The major benefit of the methodology is that it can significantly reduce the number of sites that need to be measured on each wafer enabling greater throughput on metrology tools without sacrificing process monitoring and anomaly detection capability.
