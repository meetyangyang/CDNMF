We proposed a supporting system which can classify the elders as either dementia or nondementia with high accuracy. The trajectories of the elders will be extracted from motion sensors that deployed in the smart home environment. The indoor wandering patterns according to repetitive movements are analyzed and classified using the machine learning technique. The proposed system used ambient sensors instead of wearable sensors or cameras to let the elders feel more comfortable when they are being monitored. In addition;  the proposed system only required a short period of time to screen the elders and easier for medical doctors to diagnose the elders without wasting time for asking the large quantity of diagnostic questions from a checklist that needs to be answered by the elders themselves or their caregivers.
