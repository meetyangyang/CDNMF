Unlike the conventional virtual metrology (VM) techniques that model the x–y relationship based onlyon process data, the proposed method aims at consolidatingthe process knowledge from experts into an extensive relationalstructure. Not only the x–y model is inferred but also therelationships among the predictors are revealed. The structure isillustrated in a form of a connected graph so that the correlationbetween parameters can be expressed explicitly, which is alsocompatible with the physical laws. With the clear visualization ofthe correlation structure of variables, the practitioners are able toutilize the result in different applications. The learned structurecan be further integrated into the plant advanced process control system, including VM, process monitoring and diagnosis, andrun-to-run (R2R) control.
