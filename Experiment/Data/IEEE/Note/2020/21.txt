This paper was motivated by the multitimescale problem that making a decision of controlling theindoor temperature for the userâ€™s comfort with energy constraint.Existing approaches to build a two-timescale model by experiencewould cause the inconsistent deviation. If the HVAC works ina closed environment system like a space station, besides crewcomfort, the temperature for experiments in the space stationshould be accurate. Therefore, the deviation from the actualtemperature and the desired temperature will cause adverseeffects. In this paper, we mathematically derive the thermal statetransfer equations and analyze some problems. Then, this papersuggests a new approach to build the two-timescale model forvarious conditions, in which the models of two timescales areconsistent with each other. Preliminary experiments suggest thatthis approach is feasible and effective. In future research, we will jointly make optimization and decision of multiple appliances inhome energy management (HEM) system.
