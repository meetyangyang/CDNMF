This article is motivated by the control problem of dual rotary boom crane systems. In order to meet industrial requirements, the masses and volumes of to-be-hoisted cargoes are larger than before, and consequently, dual-crane systems are more frequently needed to fulfill transportation tasks. For such systems, although they improve the load capacity, greater challenges are caused when eliminating cargo swings in the transportation process. To the best of our knowledge, current control methods are mainly designed based on linearized/reduced models, whose performance may be not satisfactory when swing angles are large. Moreover, most methods use velocity signals with unexpected noises and ignore the constraints of actuatorsâ€™ amplitudes, which may not be feasible in practical applications. To solve these problems, this article presents an output feedback controller, which can simultaneously solve the problems of saturation constraints and velocity signal unavailability. The proposed controller can guarantee accurate boom positioning and cargo swing elimination with guaranteed theoretical proof. Furthermore, the control performance is verified experimentally on a self-built testbed. In future efforts, we intend to apply the presented control method to industrial applications.
