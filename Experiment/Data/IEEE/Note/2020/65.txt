Given that the steelmaking process is adiscontinuous one and the LDG system can hardly be describedby a physical or mechanism-based model, its energy schedulingworks is usually operated by the manual method currently, whichleads to low accuracy and a waste of energy. Since a large numberof real-time data had been accumulated by the existing SCADAsystem implemented in most steel plants, a data-driven long-termscheduling approach is proposed in this study. The proposedmethod aims at the long-term scheduling of the LDG systemin steel industry, and the acquisition frequency of the real-time data is 1 min. The application system designed on the basis ofthe proposed method can provide effective scheduling solutions.Furthermore, it is necessary to ensure the data integrity andreliability via data imputation and filtering methods since theremay exist some missing data or outliners in the acquired datafrom the SCADA system onsite. This study avoids the redundantintroduction of such preliminary preprocessing methods for thesample data.
