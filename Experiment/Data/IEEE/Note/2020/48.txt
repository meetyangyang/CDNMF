This article addresses the emerging need for decision support tools for the energy management of urban street lighting systems. The proposed decision-making strategy allows city energy managers and local policy makers taking retrofit decisions on an existing public street lighting system throughout a wide urban area. The presented strategy can be implemented in any engineering software;  providing decision makers with a low-complexity and scalable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tool for the optimization of the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of street lighting systems.
