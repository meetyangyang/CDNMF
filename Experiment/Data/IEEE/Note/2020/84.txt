The challenges of equipment sensor dataanalytics in semiconductor manufacturing include building theclassifier to detect wafer abnormality correctly, identification ofkey status variable identifications (SVIDs) and processing timeand steps of abnormality, and data visualization of the abnormality in a high-dimensional feature space. This article proposesa data-driven framework for fault detection and classification(FDC) during the wafer fabrication process by incorporatingseveral useful machine learning approaches. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed data-driven framework can supply quality fault detection performances and provide valuable information regarding the critical SVIDs and associated keyprocessing time for fault diagnostic. The engineers can utilizethe extracted fault patterns to perform a prognosis of the agingeffect on process tools or modules for health management.
