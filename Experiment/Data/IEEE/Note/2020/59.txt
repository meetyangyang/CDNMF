Bridge cranes are commonly used to move heavy items in manufacturing and logistics systems. Generally;  more than one crane runs on a common track. The latest versions of such cranes;  such as those used in slab yards in the steel industry;  can hold two items simultaneously. Operations scheduling of multiple double-load cranes involves the assignment of tasks to the cranes;  the combination of tasks to double-load operations;  and sequencing of the tasks;  considering the noncrossing constraint between cranes. Effective solution of this complex problem can help to fully utilize the crane capability;  increase productivity;  and reduce energy consumption. This article models this problem and develops a heuristic solution that combines differential evolution (DE) and DP. Experiment results show that the algorithm is effective and efficient for practical use in slab yards. It may also be applicable to other systems using similar cranes.
