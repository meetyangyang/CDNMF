The proposed method aims to model a thermal field using PDEs with time-varying parameters. To better implement this method in practice;  three things are noteworthy: first;  the proposed method models a thermal field by fully considering physics-specific engineering knowledge using PDEs and the collected sensor data from thermal systems. Second;  because time-varying parameters in PDEs cannot be estimated directly;  the proposed model represents the time-varying parameters by a combination of B-spline basis functions in terms of time. Estimating time-varying parameters is converted into estimating the constant coefficients of the basis functions. Because the derivatives of a thermal field might not have an analytical expression;  the proposed model represents the thermal field by a combination of B-spline basis functions. Taking the derivatives of the thermal field is converted into taking the derivatives of the corresponding basis functions. Third;  the proposed method can not only model a thermal field but can also be applied in other physics-specific engineering cases.
