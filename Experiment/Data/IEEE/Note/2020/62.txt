Networked control structure has beenwidely used in practical applications because of its distinct flexibility, facilitation, and robustness of the entire control framework.All of the involved units in networked systems are usually locatedin different sites and communicate with each other throughwired/wireless networks. An overload of these networks can resultin packet congestion and data dropouts among other severeproblems. As a result, the reduction of communication burdenis of great significance for control through networks, for whichquantization is an effective method. In consideration of devicecost, it is preferred to apply finite-level uniform quantizer that ischeap and abundant. However, generally, this quantizer cannotguarantee an acceptable tracking performance because of itslimited quantization ability. An encodingâ€“decoding mechanismis thus proposed in this article to realize high tracking accuracywhile using a simple uniform quantizer, where a learning controlmethodology is provided to improve tracking performance gradually. In addition, random data dropouts are accommodated inthe proposed framework.
