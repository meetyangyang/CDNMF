With advances in computing and increased availability of product data;  machine learning for additive manufacturing (ML4AM) has become a viable strategy for enhancing 3-D printing accuracy. This work establishes the shape deviation generator (SDG) as a novel data analytical framework through a convolution formulation to model the 3-D shape formation in the AM process. This new engineering-informed machine-learning framework will facilitate the learning of AM data to establish models for geometric shape accuracy prediction and control.
