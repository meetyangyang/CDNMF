Since cross-modal perception can improve the active operation of automation systems;  it is invaluable for industrial intelligence;  particularly when only one sensing modality cannot be used or suitable in some applications. In this article;  we provide a framework of cross-modal material perception for object recognition using the idea of the cross-modal retrieval. Concretely;  we use relevant tactile data of an unknown object to retrieve perceptually similar surface images;  which are used to evaluate its material properties. Different from that previous works using tactile information as a complement or alternative to visual information to recognize specific objects;  our proposed framework is able to estimate and infer material properties of both seen and unseen objects;  which can enhance manipulation systems intelligence and improve the quality of the interaction. In our future works;  more modality information will be incorporated to further enhance the cross-modal material perception.
