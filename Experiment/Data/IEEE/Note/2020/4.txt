Chip shooter machines have been widely used in industry for printed circuit board assembly (PCBA). Approaches such as exact approach;  simple heuristics;  and metaheuristics have been proposed for PCBA planning. Although with the capability to find the optimal solution;  the exact approaches are found to be computationally intractable when used to deal with a problem of a practical size. Although simple heuristics are easy to use;  they usually have the difficulty to find the optimal/near-optimal solution. One recent trend is using metaheuristics to solve PCBA problems as they can avoid the computational intractability of exact approaches while improving over simple heuristics to find a better solution. In this study;  we propose an improved shuffled frogs leaping algorithm (I-SFLA2);  an advanced swarm intelligence (SI)-based metaheuristic to solve the CSP and FAP simultaneously for a chip shooter machine. With new features and smart jumps;  the I-SFLA2 is able to find a better solution compared to some previously-proposed methods.
