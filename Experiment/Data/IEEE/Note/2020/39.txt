3-D registration usually has a large computational burden in engineering tasks. The proposed symbolic solution can directly solve the eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector. A lot of computation resources can then be saved for better overall system performance. The deterministic behavior of the proposed solver also ensures long-endurance stability and can help an engineer better design thread timing logic.
