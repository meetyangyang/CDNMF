Due to high production complexity in semiconductor manufacturing process, a meticulous and intelligent process control is needed to achieve higher throughput and customer satisfaction. Monitoring a complex system is challenging because the process components and variables operate autonomously and interoperate with other manufacturing segments. This paper proposes a novel run-to-run (R2R) control system to compensate the overlay error during the photolithography process that efficiently deals with the high-mixed manufacturing environment and metrology delay.
