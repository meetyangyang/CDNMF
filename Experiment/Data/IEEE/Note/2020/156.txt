From the practical application point of view;  a new method of cross-referencing quantitative information model and qualitative information model is proposed in this article to divide the multimode production process into multiple stable modes and transitional modes. Then;  feature models are established for different mode data online for process mode-type identification. The effective mode division and identification of multimode processes is the key to realize multimode process monitoring;  evaluation;  modeling;  quality prediction;  and process optimization. Although the validity of the proposed method is verified only in a gold hydrometallurgical cyanide leaching process;  the method is equally applicable to other multimode complex industrial processes with the qualitative information and quantitative information coexistence characteristics.
