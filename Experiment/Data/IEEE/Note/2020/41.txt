Black-box identification procedures process an input-output sequence recorded for a long period of time during the functioning of a closed-loop controlled system;  and then return a model of the system. However;  even if these models simulate well the recorded sequence;  they are not very accurate. Indeed;  they simulate also other sequences that;  in general;  are not admitted by the real system. The method proposed here aims to make more accurate these models by discovering the unobservable behavior of a controlled system;  related to evolutions of the internal state (and variables) of the system without changing the capability of simulating the observed behavior.
