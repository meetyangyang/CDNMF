The current manual optically-induced dielectrophoresis (ODEP) quantification of the specific membrane capacitance (SMC) values of the cells requires a tedious and time-consuming procedure for measuring the cell size and crossover frequency. The automated ODEP approach presented in this article was developed to identify multiple cells and trigger alternating current (ac) bias potential for measuring the radius and crossover frequency of multiple cells. Compared to the manual method, the automated system significantly improves the efficiency of the SMC measurement.
