This article addresses the topic of energy efficiency of pneumatic drives;  which are widely used in automation technology due to their low cost and high reliability. It is well known that pneumatic drives are often oversized and cause waste of energy. By changing the valve hardware and control pattern;  energy savings of more than half of the compressed air consumption can be achieved as demonstrated in many scientific works. One main barrier to using such energy-saving strategies in practice is the concern about losing robustness. In this article;  we analyze the influence of energy-saving strategies on impact velocity and the functionality of internal cushioning systems. By this;  the robustness issue is addressed from two sides: the kinetic energy that needs to be absorbed at stroke end;  and the kinetic energy that can be absorbed by internal damping systems. From a practical point of view;  this contribution motivates and helps one to decide on the choice of energy-saving measures for pneumatic drives.
