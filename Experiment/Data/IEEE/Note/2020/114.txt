This paper is motivated by the load balancing problem faced by BSS with finite-capacity docking stations and time-varying demand; stations become empty or full as their popularity as an origin or destination varies over the course of a day. The proposed RHC creates dynamic cooperative routes for a fleet of load balancing trucks to move bikes between stations by considering the current inventory, demand rates, and proximity of all stations and trucks. The strength of this controller is that it achieves optimality over a specified planning horizon and reacts quickly to random inventory changes which update the planning horizon on a rolling basis. Thus, the optimal routes found for a planning horizon are updated at the next decision point, i.e., an intersection. This event-driven RHC decreases the complexity of finding optimal routes so that it may be used in real time. Insights obtained from the application of this approach to the Boston BSS are that extending the length of the receding horizon provides marginal benefits beyond a certain value and that the controller is robust with respect to the stochastic behavior of the user demand and the truck travel time processes. The approach is amenable to extensions that can include incentivizing users so as to enhance load balancing beyond external truck-based interventions.
