/i>&#x2014;Parallel disassembly is one of the most efficient disassembly methods;  and robotic disassembly will be one of the main disassembly methods in the future. Therefore;  this article focuses on the robotic parallel disassembly planning to achieve an efficient and environmentally friendly treatment of end-of-life products. With the importance of production efficiency and energy saving;  it is essential to simultaneously assess the makespan and energy consumption. The results demonstrate that the proposed artificial bee colony algorithm can provide multiple disassembly schemes that balance the makespan and energy consumption. The obtained disassembly schemes can provide references for the disassembly planning of the disassembly enterprise and expand the decision-making space for decision-makers.
