/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the requirement of effective control schemes for aerial transportation systems. The unexpected cargo swing motion may lead to safety accidents; thus;  the dual objective of swing suppression and rotorcraft positioning is the focus of research. Nevertheless;  with underactuated property;  the cargo swing motion cannot be directly controlled. Up until now;  at the cost of model accuracy;  most existing methods utilize the simplified models in near hovering state or 2-D transverse plane to reduce the control difficulty. Accounting for the foregoing problems;  this article presents a novel control scheme with improved antiswing and positioning performance. With an elaborately constructed integral term;  the designed controller could improve the positioning accuracy of the rotorcraft with the guaranteed theoretical analysis. Moreover;  to avoid the problem of actuator saturation;  the control inputs are restricted in allowable ranges during the transportation process. All these aspects are verified by rigorous theoretical analysis and groups of hardware experiments in different conditions. In future studies;  we will apply the suggested control scheme in practical applications.
