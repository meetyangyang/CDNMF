/i>&#x2014;This article aims to solve the limitation that the robot can only hand over small objects with one hand in the human&#x2013;robot handover systems. In daily life;  especially in carrying tasks;  many objects;  such as windows;  wooden boards;  and big frames;  may also be handed over to each other. These objects can be classified as big planar objects. To enable the robot to hand over this kind of object with the human;  we design a bidirectional bimanual human&#x2013;robot handover system. The designed system has three main functions. First;  the robot can receive the big planar object from the human and hold the object safely with two hands;  which is impossible in a single-hand handover system because the weight and size of the object are large. Then;  the robot can help the human hold the object or transport it to other places. Second;  the robot can adjust the object handover position according to the human&#x2019;s intentions while holding the object. Because the size of objects and the height of humans may different;  or some tasks require that the human position be higher or lower than the robot;  the current object holding position may be hard for the current human operator to take over the object. With this function;  the human can move the object to an appropriate position and then take it comfortably. Third;  the robot releases the object only when it gets a clear signal. Before that;  the robot always grasps the object safely;  and the human can freely adjust his posture. With the designed handover system;  the robot can cooperate with the human to complete more tasks indoors or in factories.
