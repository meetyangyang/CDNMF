/i>&#x2014;The operation and management of appointment systems is becoming much more sophisticated these years; however;  worldwide;  outpatient clinics still suffer from a common conundrum;  which is the extensive backlog accumulation. Patients not showing up to their clinic appointments are one of the major contributors to this issue. The overbooking approach;  which redesigns the appointment system by releasing more appointment slots than budgeted;  is typically employed to address this no-show issue. However;  the practice of overbooking should be carried out carefully;  and the performance of system backlog as well as the risk of overworking should be considered simultaneously. This work provides a practical tool to assist the management of appointment capacity in outpatient clinics.
