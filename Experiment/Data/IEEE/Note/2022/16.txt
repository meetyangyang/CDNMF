/i>\n—Process monitoring in a multisensor environment has been a vital interest in manufacturing. The difficulty lies in the lack of detection power in many conventional techniques;  e.g.;  control chart and logistic regression. A critical reason for such failure is the neglect of time effect in MTS—patterns associated with system faults tend to stretch a period;  but a conventional control chart or classifier inspects each time stamp separately. Fault detection based on time series sequences is;  therefore;  essential. However;  how to effectively extract features from MTS becomes a challenge. The framework proposed in this study adopts BOW models;  specifically symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX);  to extract features from MTS sequences;  thus substantially improves the detection power against local patterns over time. Many manufacturing multisensor data are subject to such local patterns that point to the root cause of fault;  so the proposed framework has a wide application in manufacturing.
