/i>\n—In this article;  we address the online parking-space sharing issue with considering the parking-space providers (PSPs) and customers’ individual utility while preserving the location privacy of customers’ destinations. Most of the previous works focused on designing a centralized mechanism for allocating parking spaces without considering the protection of the customers’ location privacy. In particular;  we propose an online parking-space sharing scheme called DPOPS;  including a novel threshold value-based winner determination rule and a parking-space allocation rule. The proposed scheme DPOPS allows the PSPs and customers submit their bids and asks according to their own willingness and is able to improve the utilization of private parking spaces during their idle time periods. Moreover;  the location privacy of customers’ destinations is protected by the Laplace mechanism. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the exponential-based scheme in terms of PSP satisfaction ratio and the travel distance for parking-space customer. The proposed scheme is helpful in managing the vacant parking space in a competitive market and can be readily implemented in the real-world online parking-space sharing systems.
