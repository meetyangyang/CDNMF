/i>&#x2014;The DMPC algorithm proposed in this article is designed for networked systems where certain subsystems may be removed or inserted. The purpose is to obtain a fast response to this topology change of system. An integrated algorithm is provided for the application of the strategy. First;  the parameters of the MPCs are initialized. Then;  before the command of a switch in topology is given;  local controllers for normal situations provide the real-time inputs. Once the switch of topology is commanded;  additional optimization problems are solved in the related subsystems&#x2019; controllers to guarantee the feasibility of removal or plugging-in operation. The optimization problems involved in each MPCs can be solved by adopting efficiently quadratic programming solvers supported by MATLAB. Note that although the topology change is commanded;  all the subsystems are still operated normally until the topology change is conducted. In general;  the strategy introduced in this article can be applied to control a class of large-scale networked systems;  where each subsystem-based controller can exchange information with its neighbors.
