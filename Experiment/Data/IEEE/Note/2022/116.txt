/i>&#x2014;Traditional nonwearable fall detection approaches typically make use of a vision-based sensor;  such as camera;  to monitor and detect fall using a classifier that is trained in a supervised fashion on the collected fall and nonfall data. However;  several problems render these methods impractical. First;  camera-based monitoring may trigger privacy concerns. Second;  fall data collection using human subjects is difficult and costly;  not to mention the impossible ask of the elderly repeating simulated falls for data collection. In this article;  we propose a new fall detection approach to overcome these problems 1) using a palm-size mmWave radar sensor to monitor the elderly;  that is highly sensitive to motion while protecting privacy and 2) using a semisupervised anomaly detection approach to circumvent the fall data collection. Further hardware engineering and more training data from people with different body figures could make the proposed fall detection solution even more practical.
