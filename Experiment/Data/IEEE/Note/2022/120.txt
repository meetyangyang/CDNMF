/i>&#x2014;Open and irreversible;  zone-controlled;  guidepath-based transport systems is a natural abstraction of the traffic dynamics taking place in many unit-load material handling systems (MHSs);  like the automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems and the overhead monorail systems that are used in many industrial facilities. In these environments;  vehicles are circulating in a &#x201C;guidepath network&#x201D; that is defined either by the physical structure of the corresponding MHS (as in the case of the overhead monorail systems) or more artificially;  in an effort to isolate the traffic of these vehicles from the surrounding environment (as in the case of the AGV systems). Furthermore;  in order to ensure collision-free motion for the traveling vehicles;  the edges of this guidepath network are divided into zones;  and it is stipulated that each zone is allocated to at most one vehicle at any time. This restriction renders the considered transport systems susceptible to deadlock;  and therefore;  their traffic controller must control the generated traffic for ensuring high productivity;  but also for ensuring &#x201C;traffic liveness; &#x201D; i.e.;  the ability of every vehicle to complete successfully its current assignment and engage in similar assignments in the future. An effective and computationally efficient manner to maintain traffic liveness is by restricting the considered transport systems within a particular subclass of traffic states that is known as <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$h$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-ordered. The considered article provides streamlined;  customized algorithms for effecting this restriction.
