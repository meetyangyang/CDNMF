/i>\n—This article was motivated by the problem of assessing human upper limbs’ mobility during a rehabilitation process. Existing systems are often inaccurate and/or not affordable. This article suggests a new approach by combining measurements from inertial measurement units and augmented reality markers into an adaptive filter that is taking into account the kinematics model of the human arm and its limitation to filter out unfeasible solutions. The system is also making use of a new very practical calibration method not requiring any external equipment while remaining very affordable. Experimental results suggest that the proposed system is able to estimate more accurately than state-of-the-art joint angles of the upper limbs.
