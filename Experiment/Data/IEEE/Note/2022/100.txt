/i>&#x2014;This article was motivated to explicitly account for the uncertain terrain environment in mission planning of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). Existing approaches;  e.g.;  RRT and its variants;  in general;  oversimplify the uncertainty sources and overlook the reliability of vehicle mobility. These simplifications could lead to failure (i.e.;  immobility) of off-road AGVs on the obtained paths. This article suggests a reliability-based mission planning model by incorporating the proposed SMR and MMR metrics into mission planning considering the spatial-dependent uncertainty sources. To identify a reliable and robust path;  we extend RRT&#x002A; to R2-RRT&#x002A; that achieves a tradeoff between mission cost and reliability. The proposed reliability-based mission planning model;  however;  is not limited to RRT&#x002A; and can also be integrated with other path planning algorithms. It can be also applied to other unmanned vehicles and robots;  such as the motion planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in adverse weather conditions.
