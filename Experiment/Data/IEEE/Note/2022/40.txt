/i>&#x2014;The forest firefighting problem considered in this article is a typical multitask and multistage optimization problem. Many searching algorithms for multistage optimization problem are available in the existing literature. However;  one of the main challenges is that the time of searching increases exponentially with the number of stages. This work first proves that the tasks are completed in the minimum amount of time;  under the constraint of one-shot assignment. This finding helps us to evaluate the gap between the searching algorithm and the optimal solution. In addition;  in practice;  if the underlying dynamic process can be modeled or partially modeled;  then we can predict the behavior of future stages and reduce the searching domain. If a model is available;  then we can also adjust the assignment scheme dynamically based on the principle that each adjustment would reduce the total time of tasks completion. In this article;  we establish a dynamical fire-spreading model and propose a model-based solution to the multistage optimization problems. The findings in this work can serve as a supplement to the existing optimization algorithms.
