/i>\nâ€”This article addresses the problem of estimating center of mass (CoM) and center of pressure (CoP) trajectories using a minimum number of wearable sensors and reliable algorithms during human daily walking. Estimation of CoM and CoP trajectories is critical for lower limb exoskeletons;  prostheses;  and legged robots. In this study;  a novel method named VO-based estimation of CoM and CoP (VOECC) is presented that utilizes a walking model as prior knowledge and integrates it with visual odometry data;  which estimates the trajectory of the wearable visual device. Compared with the inertia measurement unit (IMU)-based method;  VOECC only uses one wearable visual device and thus significantly reduces the cost and system complexity. In addition;  the VOECC outperforms the motion capture system and force plate since it is not limited to space constraints and has the potential to be applicable for daily life locomotion tasks. VOECC is wearable and untethered and therefore can be directly amounted on lower limb exoskeletons;  prostheses;  and legged robots. In the experiments;  motion capture system and force plates are used to measure CoM and CoP as ground truth to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VOECC. Practical limitations include failure from fast turning and synchronization of multichannel sensors. These limitations will be addressed as our future research directions.
