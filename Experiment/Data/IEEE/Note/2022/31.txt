/i>&#x2014;This article is motivated by our collaborations with two hospitals in Shanghai;  China. Covid-19 has swept the world since 2019 and is still raging in many regions;  posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems in countries worldwide. The hospitals are the frontlines of healthcare service;  and the physicians are the most critical resource in the battles to coronavirus pandemic. In China;  many large-scale hospitals establish fever clinics to serve fever patients. The physician scheduling for such clinics is different and complicated in the Covid-19 due to many specific constraints. We find that the managers are tough to give high-quality schedules to physicians. Thus;  we propose a set of algorithms to solve this problem. Especially;  a two-phase approach that consists of a staffing standard and a branch-and-price algorithm is designed. Based on hospitals&#x2019; real-life data;  we show that the methods presented in this article can be used to help hospital managers obtain more reasonable scheduling solutions that can improve the service quality without increasing the workloads of physicians.
