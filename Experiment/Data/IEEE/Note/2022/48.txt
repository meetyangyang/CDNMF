/i>\n—The motivation behind this article is the problem of inefficient fertilizer application in corn fields throughout the cultivation season. Current widely spread techniques to counter plant malnutrition suggest the application of excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer prior to seeding or the uniform application during the plant growth. These practices result in financial losses and have severe environmental consequences;  e.g.;  the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. We propose an automation framework that automatically detects corn nitrogen deficiencies in the field during the plants’ growth;  and to achieve our goal;  we employ low-cost robotic platforms and RGB sensors. The framework that we developed is able to detect the characteristic pattern of nitrogen deficiency on corn leaves and provide an estimation of the in-field spatial variability of the deficiency.
