/i>&#x2014;This research is motivated by controlling the outbreak of Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS);  in Australia&#x2019;s Great Barrier Reef;  by employing a certain class of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with the injection arm. A new evolutionary algorithm;  called heuristic fleet cooperation (HFC);  is designed upon a hierarchal priority evolution to facilitate a multivehicle dynamic task assignment problem. The HFC is able to rapidly prototype multiple optimal solutions for efficient grouping and accomplishment of the tasks spread over a large operation area.
