/i>\nâ€”Most dynamic speed limit control techniques used to manage traffic flow on highways rely on discretizations of partial differential equations;  which require one to compute the solution on a computational grid. This article focuses on an alternate solution method that does not require the solution to be found on all grid points;  potentially saving computational time on large-scale problems.
