/i>&#x2014;This article aims to advance the state of the art for workflow scheduling in clouds by taking into account endpoint communication contention that can occur in practice but has largely been neglected in existing investigations. A scheduling method called Endpoint communication contention-aware List Scheduling Heuristic (ELSH) is then proposed to optimize workflow makespan. Experimental results based on synthetic and realistic workflows show that ELSH performs better than traditional scheduling algorithms that fail to consider endpoint communication contention;  especially for the workflow with a large communication-to-computation-cost ratio. The proposed approach can be readily put into use and help cloud service providers to offer their customers high-quality services when executing the latter&#x2019;s workflows.
