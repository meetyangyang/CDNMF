/i>\n—Multichannel data are often encountered in various big-data-related applications. It is vital for a data analyzer to correctly capture the temporal patterns hidden in them for efficient knowledge acquisition and representation. This article focuses on analyzing temporal QoS data;  which is a representative kind of multichannel data. To correctly extract their temporal patterns;  an analyzer should correctly describe their nonnegativity. Such a purpose can be achieved by building a nonnegative latent factorization of tensors (NLFT) model relying on a single latent factor-dependent;  nonnegative and multiplicative update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) algorithm. But its learning depth is not adjustable;  making an NLFT model frequently suffer from severe fluctuations in its training error or even fail to converge. To address this issue;  this study carefully investigates the learning rules for an NLFT model’s decision parameters using an SLF-NMUT and proposes a joint learning-depth-adjusting scheme. This scheme manipulates the multiplicative terms in SLF-NMUT-based learning rules linearly and exponentially;  thereby making the learning depth adjustable. Based on it;  this study builds a novel depth-adjusted nonnegative latent-factorization-of-tensors (DNL) model. Compared with the existing NLFT models;  a DNL model better represents multichannel data. It meets industrial needs well and can be used to achieve high performance in data analysis tasks like temporal-aware missing data estimation.
