/i>\n—This work deals with a scheduling problem of a batch production process;  i.e.;  wire rod and bar rolling;  which is modeled by a Petri net (PN). Due to the NP-hardness of the concerned problem;  four iterated greedy algorithm-based methods are developed to solve it. The proposed methods are validated and tested by comparing their solutions with those of four heuristic peers and the exact ones (when available via CPLEX). Extensive experimental results show that they can fast solve one-week-scale instances with better performance than their peers’;  thereby proving the readiness to put them in industrial use. When solving a one-month-scale instance;  the proposed methods show much better performance than others.
