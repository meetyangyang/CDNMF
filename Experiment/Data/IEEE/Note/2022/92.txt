/i>&#x2014;Accurate stiffness tracking of SEAs can achieve safe human&#x2013;robot interaction. However;  the time delays introduced by the imprecise movement and estimation of external force can lead to inaccurate actuator response that may limit the capacity of safety insurance. To overcome this issue;  a fast-response admittance control method is proposed for SEAs by adopting a novel P-ATS compensator. Thus;  the time delays and errors from both load movement and external force estimation can be adaptively compensated. Several strategies have been adopted to enhance the compensator for parameter determination to achieve better performance. The proposed method requires no additional previous information about the system except load mass and spring stiffness;  which makes it easy to implement for different types of SEAs. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve faster and more accurate stiffness tracking under different conditions. Future work aims to address the control problem under random disturbances and apply the proposed method to human&#x2013;robot collaboration tasks to further test its performance.
