/i>&#x2014;The unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19 and its rapid spread caught numerous national and local governments unprepared. Healthcare systems faced a vital scarcity of PPEs. The urgency of producing and delivering PPEs increases as the number of infected cases rapidly increases. A key challenge in response to the epidemic is effectively and efficiently matching the demands and needs. Performing practical and efficient order assignment and scheduling for PPE production during the COVID-19 outbreak is critical to curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. This work first proposes a bi-objective mixed-integer linear program for optimal order assignment and scheduling for PPE production. The aim is to achieve an economical and timely PPE production and supply. A novel method that combines the <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-constraint framework and the logic-based Benders decomposition is proposed to yield high-quality Pareto solutions for practical-sized problems. Computational results indicate that the proposed approaches are practical and feasible;  which can help decision-makers to perform acceptable order assignment and scheduling decisions.
