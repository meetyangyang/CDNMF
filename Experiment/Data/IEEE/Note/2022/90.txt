/i>&#x2014;FTIR spectrometer is often used to characterize the surface chemical composition of a material. Due to the large uncertainties associated with the nature of spectrometer and the measurement environment;  the FTIR signals are usually examined visually by experienced engineers and technicians in industrial applications;  which can be both time-consuming and inaccurate. To understand the effect of plasma exposure on the surface property of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) material;  the elimination of uncertainties associated with FTIR signals is investigated;  and a systematic method is proposed to quantify the effect of surface treatments on FTIR signals. A two-step analytic procedure is proposed;  which provides information on how the plasma exposure distorts the FTIR signals;  and how the plasma distance relates to the magnitude of the distortion. The methodology in this article can be used to analyze the treatment effect on a variety of spectroscopic measurements that are subject to uncertainties such as offset and scaling errors;  which expands the applications of in situ handheld spectrometer metrology in manufacturing industries.
