/i>&#x2014;This article was motivated by the problem of the feature line extraction for real scanned point clouds. Feature lines;  as one kind of the most important structure information;  depict the basic shape of the real object in our life. Extracting this kind of shape features from the unstructured point clouds can facilitate a variety of downstream practical applications;  such as product design;  workpiece manufacturing;  and robotic grasping. Existing approaches to detect features either heavily rely on differential quantities;  which are sensitive to the noise;  or need an elaborately designed local descriptor but fail to recognize small-scale features. These challenges motivate us to design a new approach aiming at extracting multiscale feature lines while keeping robustness to heavy noise. The technique developed in this work can produce high-quality feature points and feature lines;  which would serve as higher level structural information and facilitate many applications. Additional applications in 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) pose estimation demonstrate the potential of our method for robotic picking.
