/i>&#x2014;This article was motivated to ensure safer and efficient operations within indoor facilities by evaluating contact-caused risks and entrance/exit policies during a pandemic situation like coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Most of the recent works related to COVID-19 disease propagation focus on the evaluation of disease transmission at an organization level;  however;  limited studies focus on the operational aspect of indoor facilities within the organization. To bridge this gap;  this article utilizes an agent-based modeling approach to model and understand the pedestrian dynamics in the classroom-like facilities considering physical distancing;  seat assignment;  and entry/exit policies. Comprehensive simulation modeling and analysis allows the amalgamation of real data;  including layout;  class schedules;  seating arrangement;  and allowable capacity to perform various what-if analyses under different policies. This article proposes and evaluates seating assignment based on the associated number and duration of contacts during movements in the pathway and entrance/ exit area of a confined space. In addition;  this work evaluates different indoor layouts (e.g.;  classroom;  meeting room;  and office) and exit policies (e.g.;  zonal and non-zonal) at different occupancy levels for appropriate decision support. The proposed approach will aid organizations (e.g.;  educational institutions;  corporate offices;  and recreational facilities) to evaluate necessary policies (namely entrance and exit policy;  seating policy;  and room layout) for safe indoor operations with respect to the minimum contact-caused risk associated with the activities. As a future direction;  the outputs from the proposed work can be utilized to obtain the realistic input parameters needed for organization-wide disease propagation models;  which will provide decision support at an organizational level.
