/i>\nâ€”This work deals with the subway fire risk assessment problem. It proposes a cloud model based on interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic and builds a cloud-based Petri net model. The methods of fire risk assessment use the existing fault trees or aggregation operators to combine all the factors into consideration;  but they do not take the interaction of factors. The goal of this work is to assess the risk of subway fire accident of subway;  using fuzzy linguistic decision variables. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is highly effective. The obtained results can help assessors better determine which factors may cause the disaster.
