/i>\nâ€”In the soft neuromorphic implementation of biomimetic tactile sensing and the development of the tactile sensing capability in neurobotic systems;  the processing and analysis of spike-like tactile signals are quite common. Inspired by human tactile perception;  this article proposes a novel supervised spiking neural network method for tactile sensing tasks. The traditional methods have to prespecify target spike trains;  which is still an open question. In addition;  the current ways to fuse spike trains from multiple neurons are far from mature. This article tackles these two problems using spike train similarity comparison with multineuron spike train distance. The direct spike train similarity comparison avoids the need to prespecify target spike trains. The multineuron spike train distance can inherently fuse spike trains from different neurons. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is able to effectively perform classification in a tactile roughness discrimination task.
