/i>\n—This article was motivated by solving the problem of nonrigidly registering two point sets where one has been deformed and corrupted with anisotropic noise. Most existing registration methods generally assume the positional error to be the same in all directions;  which in fact is not the case in real scenarios. This article presents a new robust method that assumes the positional error to be anisotropic;  which is the case in point sets coming from the stereo reconstruction. The nonrigid registration problem is formulated as a maximum-likelihood (ML) problem and solved with the expectation–maximization (EM) technique. We have demonstrated through extensive experiments on both general and medical data sets that the proposed registration algorithm achieves significantly improved accuracy;  robustness to noise;  and outliers compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The algorithm is particularly suitable for biomedical applications involving the registration;  such as medical imaging and image-guided surgery (IGS).
