/i>\n—It is very common in manufacturing practice that operators;  engineers;  and managers need to make decisions on-the-fly to ensure efficient production operations. One of the key tasks involved is to identify real-time bottleneck (RTBN). This is typically carried out based on the practitioners’ intuition and experience. With the advances in sensing;  computing;  and communication technologies emerging in the Industry 4.0 era;  manufacturers now have the capability to collect;  process;  and visualize an enormous amount of data in real time. This provides a foundation for more rigorous real-time production management and control. The research described in this article is intended to provide such a tool for RTBN identification in production lines and;  thus;  guide timely decision-making on the factory floor for smarter production activities.
