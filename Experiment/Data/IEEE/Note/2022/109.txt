/i>&#x2014;This article is motivated by the problem of improving the monitoring and the supervision of systems;  such as automated and robotized manufacturing systems. Based on a model of the system;  this article proposes a method to assert with certainty whether the available set of sensors will always provide enough information to ensure that a complex and unexpected behavior has not happened in the system. The proposed method uses a publicly available model-checking tool to perform this analysis.
