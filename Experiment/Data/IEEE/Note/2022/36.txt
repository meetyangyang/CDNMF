/i>&#x2014;This article;  for the first time;  to the best of our knowledge;  proposes an integrated approach to reduce both electrical and embodied energy consumption of a machining process through optimizing process plan and cutting parameters. Such broader consideration makes this integrated optimization approach more applicable to real industry settings and contributes to the comprehensive improvement of energy efficiency in the machining process. To better use this approach;  the following three steps should be highlighted: 1) the energy footprint characteristics of the machining process should be comprehensively analyzed and modeled; 2) the integrated optimization model for minimizing energy footprint and production time needs to cooperate with machining constraints;  such as process centralization;  machining sequence;  and process requirements; and 3) solving the proposed model is a hybrid programming process since there are discrete decision variables and continuous variables. A proper algorithm should be used to solve the proposed model.
