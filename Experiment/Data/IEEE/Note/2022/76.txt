/i>\nâ€”This work attacks the fact that faulty training samples are usually much harder to be collected than the normal training samples in the practice of chiller automated fault diagnosis (AFD). Modern supervised learning chiller AFD relies on a sufficient number of faulty training samples to train the classifier. When the number of faulty training samples is insufficient;  the conventional AFD methods fail to work. This study proposed a variational autoencoder-based conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (CWGAN-GP-VAE) framework for generating synthetic faulty training samples to enrich the training data set for machine learning-based AFD methods. The proposed algorithm has been carefully designed;  implemented;  and practically proved to be more effective than the existing methods in the literature.
