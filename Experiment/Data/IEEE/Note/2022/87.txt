/i>\nâ€”Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly popular for information collection tasks in defense and civilian applications alike. When the collection area is large;  it is not unusual that a fleet of UAVs is deployed. Routing of a fleet can be performed in a centralized or decentralized manner. Decentralized routing might be the only possibility when centralized situational awareness is not possible due to bandwidth limitations and when centralized optimal routes for each UAV are too complex to compute. For managers of UAV systems;  our work provides a theoretical bound on how bad decentralized routing could be in the context of a prize-collecting game. Under a game-theoretic framework;  we prove that the fleet will collect at least 50% of the prizes collected by the optimal centralized solution. Empirically;  we show that the performance of the fleet is much better;  usually providing at least 90% of the optimal centralized solution. Our routing strategies provide valuable guidance to the practicing engineer or manager of a UAV fleet.
