/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the robust localization and mapping for mobile robots. We suggest a novel simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach fusing the plane and edge features in indoor scenes (plane-edge-SLAM). This newly proposed approach works well in the textureless or dark scenes and is robust to the sensor noise. The experiments are carried out in various indoor scenes for mobile robots;  and the results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. In future work;  we will address the fusion of other high-level features (for example;  3-D lines) and the active exploration of the environments.
