/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the problem of airdropping massive goods and materials. Existing methods usually adopt a single heavy parafoil;  or use centralized multiparafoil systems. Both these methods have their limitations. For the former;  there is an upper limit of the load capacity for a single parafoil. For the latter;  the parafoils in the centralized system lack fully autonomous ability. Distributed multiparafoil systems could solve the problem effectively. However;  compared to single-parafoil systems;  there are still some challenges;  for example;  the multiparafoil gathering;  collision avoidance and cooperative formation;  as well as the upwind landing. Fortunately;  existing parafoils are equipped with sensors;  communication;  and control devices;  so they could be viewed as agents with autonomous capabilities. In this article;  a formation guidance framework for multiple autonomous parafoils is proposed. First;  we plan a trajectory for the pilot parafoil. Then;  we show how to effectively track the planned trajectory. Finally;  we demonstrate how multiple parafoils could coordinate with each other to accomplish airdrop tasks. The simulation results confirm the feasibility of this strategy.
