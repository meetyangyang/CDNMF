/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the fact that;  despite modern advanced automation;  human operators are still central in the manufacturing process. However;  technological progress often causes challenging interaction with complex industrial systems. The goal of this article is to introduce a complete framework for adaptive automation;  with the ultimate goal of facilitating the interaction of human operators with complex industrial systems. The framework relies on three modules: measurement of human capabilities;  the adaption of the interaction system;  and additional teaching and support. The three modules are discussed at a high level;  independently of the target application. Moreover;  to facilitate their application in specific working contexts;  examples are provided with respect to three different industrial applications. Results of tests carried out with shop-floor operators show that implementing the proposed framework allows better working performance and increases worker satisfaction with the use of automation.
