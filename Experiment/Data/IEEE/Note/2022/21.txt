/i>\n—MCSA in CMfg is a complicated and challenging task. The current industrial applications rely on optimization methods;  such as all-in-one methods (e.g.;  genetic algorithm) and multidiscipline design optimization methods (e.g.;  analytical target cascading);  to allocate MCSs. While these methods can help cloud operators obtain feasible allocation solutions rapidly;  there exist several disadvantages: 1) they can only solve problems in one-sided settings (one customer with many providers); 2) there is an assumption that the customer’s demand can be provided by any providers;  which means providers’ capacities are infinite; and 3) the problem is optimized based on the fixed prices provided by providers;  without considering supply and demand. This article presents two multiunit double auction mechanisms that allow multiple customers to trade with multiple providers. Allocation rules can break the assumption and providers’ capacities are limited. MCSs are also priced dynamically based on supply and demand. We show how cloud operators apply two mechanisms first and demonstrate their properties and bidding strategies of customers and providers when the mechanism is not incentive compatible. Finally;  our experiments and analysis fully validate the applicability and efficiency of two mechanisms and illustrate how cloud operators can maximize their utilities.
