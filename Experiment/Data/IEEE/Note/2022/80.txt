/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the real industrial needs of inner erosion detection of tubes in harsh environment. Most of the current research works focus on designing various sensing apparatuses based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for nondestructive erosion detection. These apparatuses prove to be able to collect signals reflecting tube wall thickness in static and controllable laboratory environment qualitatively. However;  in reality;  the industrial environment;  which is impacted by many changing factors;  is dynamic and uncontrollable. Consequently;  the signals collected by these FBG apparatuses would have larger variations that mask the signals related to thickness. Furthermore;  current methods have neither mentioned how to process their collected data to capture the unnoticeably slow but accumulative erosion information efficiently nor constructed online monitoring algorithms to detect the tube wall thinning process based on the collected signals quantitatively. Built upon their apparatuses but targeting at their unsolved challenges;  we propose a novel data-driven approach for FBG signal analysis that can remove the environmental influence and extract features only related to tube wall thickness;  and using the extracted features;  we construct a statistical process control scheme to monitor tube wall thickness and detect erosion in real time efficiently.
