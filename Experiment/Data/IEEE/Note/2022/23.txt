/i>&#x2014;In this article;  a computationally fast optimization framework is presented to study the delicate balance between reopening U.S. communities and controlling severe cases of COVID-19 that lead to hospitalizations and fatalities. This framework can provide guidance to decision-makers on optimal intervention strategies for protecting high-risk individuals while reopening communities. This optimization framework demonstrates a practical approach to conduct decision-making in an uncertain environment and can be useful for the prioritization of resources and interventions in the case of future epidemics or pandemics. Resources on understanding and implementing the framework are publicly available;  including an award-winning online optimization tool that automatically accesses county-level data from Census;  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC);  and Johns Hopkins COVID-19 repositories.
