/i>\nâ€”This article forwards a new supervised feature extraction method termed clustered discriminant regression. This method is highly effective for classification analysis of high-dimensional data;  such as images or videos;  where the number of variables is much larger than the number of samples. In our case studies on healthcare and additive manufacturing;  the performance of classification analysis based on our method is superior over the existing feature extraction methods;  which is confirmed by using various popular classification algorithms. For image classification;  our method with elaborately selected classification algorithms can outperform a convolutional neural network. In addition;  the computation efficiency of the proposed method is also promising;  which enables its online applications;  such as advanced manufacturing process monitoring and control.
