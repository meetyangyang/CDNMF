/i>&#x2014;We present a novel analytical framework for modeling the primary care delivery system and obtain the equilibrium patient flows under different queue-joining behaviors. This framework enables a rigorous analytical investigation of system configurations and their influence on system performance under a reasonable level of abstraction. System efficiency can be improved by taking advantage of patients&#x2019; heterogeneity in care preferences and time sensitivity. Queue information management and coordination of servers are found to be crucial in achieving the best efficiency;  especially with growing flexible customers in the population. The methodology and analysis put forth in this study provide actionable insights into care delivery planners engaged in facilitating e-visits;  especially during the COVID pandemic.
