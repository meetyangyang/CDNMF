/i>\nâ€”This article explored methods to reduce the need of additional modifications on structured environments to implement automation. Existing approaches in chemical synthesis automation require substantial modifications on apparatus to incorporate automation;  and hence;  they are inflexible to changes in the procedures or reactions. This article suggested a new system that performed chemical reactions in an existing setup used by human chemist and was flexible in the production sequence or addition of tasks. We showed how the robot arm was capable of automating a Michael reaction and repeating the experiment again;  which could be further extended multiple times. The yield obtained by the robot was comparable to junior chemist and consistent but lower than a senior chemist. Hence;  we could improve the yield by understanding skills of a senior chemist and transferring them to the robot.
