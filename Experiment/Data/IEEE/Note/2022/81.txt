/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the problem of dispatching autonomous haul trucks on open-cut mine sites. The proposed method is suited to any industrial transportation system where a continuous stream of goods must be efficiently transported between the load and unload stations by a potentially heterogeneous fleet of automated vehicles. The system makes decisions in real time while reacting to performance variations and disturbances by using a receding horizon approach. Off-the-shelf software commonly used in this domain is based on heuristics with limited ability to optimize;  leading to myopic decision making without taking vehicle interactions into account. Here;  flow-achieving scheduling tree (FAST) overcomes this by optimizing over possible schedules and thereby implicitly accounting for knock-on effects. Future work will incorporate additional constraints into the optimization process and validate FAST in other industrial domains.
