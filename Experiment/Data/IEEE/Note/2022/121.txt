/i>&#x2014;This article aims to propose a strategy of control optimization for conveyor-based manufacturing systems under the digital twin (DT) framework. The conveyor system can be flexible to control the running flows to avoid overloading workstations. Due to the complex environment in the production line;  the range that is able to be inspected and the capacity of the reserve area can be considerably diverse among the workstations. To maximally evaluate our framework;  we set a comparatively complex environment for the experiments. Nevertheless;  to obtain practically ideal performance under other circumstances;  the parameters should be precisely tested and fine-tuned with simulation in advance.
