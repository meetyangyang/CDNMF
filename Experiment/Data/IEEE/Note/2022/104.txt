/i>&#x2014;The research in this article is motivated by the problem of fault prognosis in the manufacturing system. If some information used for prediction is lost;  can engineers still make correct decisions about the occurrences of fault? This article aims to investigate the approach of assuring the accuracy and reliability of prediction by introducing the notion of robust prognosis. A polynomial-time algorithm of verifying the robust prognosability is proposed by constructing the tester automaton.
