/i>&#x2014;In a wealth of tactile recognition tasks;  we are in the face of various challenges. For instance;  tactile measurements are commonly tensorial and high-dimensional. The misalignments among tactile measurements prevail;  such as different durations of tactile measurements and the misaligned starting time point of tactile measurements. This article presents a kernel-based method using an ideal regularized composite kernel to deal with all challenges in a unified framework. The kernel-based method consists of two key components including the SVD-based kernel and the global alignment kernel. The proposed method may shed new insights on new advances in tactile signal processing particularly in human&#x2013;robot interactions.
