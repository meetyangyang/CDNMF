/i>&#x2014;This article was motivated by the recent interest in utilizing the collective behavior of small-scale active agents to perform micromanipulation tasks. Driven by external magnetic fields;  building blocks are gathered and assembled;  yielding a dynamically stable pattern. To perform practical tasks;  efficient pattern formation;  control;  and navigation are required. Besides;  obstacles often exist in the working environment;  challenging pattern navigation;  and manipulation tasks. The strategy presented here is developed for micromanipulation using dynamically self-assembled magnetic droplets with needle guidance. The three-axis Helmholtz coil system is applied to rotate the droplets and magnetize the iron needle. Algorithms are designed to guide and optimize the pattern formation;  navigation;  and cargo trapping process. Magnetic droplets are real-time tracked;  and ordered assembled patterns are formed in an optimized way. Following the needle;  the pattern was navigated and performed cargo manipulation tasks with obstacle-avoidance capability. Experimental results have validated the proposed strategy in pattern formation;  navigation;  and cargo manipulation in a multiple-obstacle environment.
