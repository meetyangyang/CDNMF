/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the need to optimize the relocation process in the electric vehicle (EV)-sharing systems in order to minimize the relocation costs and guarantee the high quality of the service. To this aim;  we first propose a centralized optimization that can be applied by the EV-sharing company for incentivizing users to optimally relocate vehicles in the stations. In this context;  both the users and the company obtain benefits. Second;  the randomized matheuristic optimization allows the stations to reach a decision about the relocation plan by using local information. The presented strategies can be applied in real applications;  and in particular;  the randomized matheuristic approach appears a promising strategy for large systems by using limited resources with low computational effort. Future research will focus on the EVs relocation problem in free-floating sharing systems.
