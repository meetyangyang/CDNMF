/i>&#x2014;The extremely complicated dynamics of blast furnace ironmaking process make the model-based controllers difficult to realize in practice. In this article;  a novel robust model-free adaptive predictive control method is proposed for direct data-driven control of multivariate molten iron quality in the ironmaking process. This method directly uses the process input and output data to design the multivariable quality controller online by the compact-form dynamic linearization technology and the internal multilayer prediction mechanism;  thus avoids the drawback of model-based controllers in troublesome process modeling. Moreover;  the proposed method can effectively avoid the influence of data loss and measurement noise on the controller performance with the designed Kalman filter-based robust mechanism. The superiority and practicability of the proposed method are verified using various experiments against actual industrial data.
