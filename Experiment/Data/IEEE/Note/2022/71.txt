/i>\n—This article is motivated by the requirements for increased safety;  increased efficiency in energy consumption;  and lower congestion in signalized intersections. We take advantage of the traffic signal phase and timing information based on vehicle to infrastructure communication;  and use the information to plan the vehicle’s trajectory to avoid the red traffic signal. An optimal speed profile is developed to achieve a trade-off between minimizing trip time and avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration which corresponds to minimizing energy consumption. We then show how such a speed profile can be efficiently computed and control the motion of an autonomous vehicle (or serve as an intelligent speed advisory system for human-driven vehicles) leading to a safe;  time-efficient;  and energy-efficient trip. A video of a real autonomous vehicle test implementing our control algorithm can be found at \n<uri xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ao4szeLYo</uri>\n.
