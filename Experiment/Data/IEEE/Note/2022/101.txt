/i>&#x2014;Jigs and fixture systems are the fundamental manufacturing elements that are used for ensuring assembly quality. Traditionally;  manufacturers have produced a small variety of products in massive quantities using dedicated jig and fixture systems. However;  these dedicated workholding systems do not fit for the Today&#x2019;s rapidly changing market. In order to enhance the reconfigurability of these systems;  we propose a transformable pin array-based part fixturing system including part position optimization. Due to the system complexity;  the assembly quality can be lower using the transformable fixtures than the conventional fixtures. Therefore;  it is further necessary to develop a cost-effective reconfigurable fixture while preserving the assembly quality for the better chance of its industrial implementation.
