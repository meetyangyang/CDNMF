/i>\nâ€”Automatic online chatter detection is crucial in order to allow operators to timely interfere with the process and avoid detrimental effects caused by chatter. However;  the practical machining process is considerably complex especially for unstable scenarios;  where the beat effect is likely to occur simultaneously. Traditional chatter detection methods neglect the presence of the beat effect;  and they will give misleading results and even false alarms when the beat effect is present. This article seeks to accurately detect chatter with and without the beat effect in a unified framework. The proposed solution can be integrated into the machine tool system;  hence;  to enhance the productivity;  reliability;  and precision of the machining process.
