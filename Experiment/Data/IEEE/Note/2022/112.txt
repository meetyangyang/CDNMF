/i>&#x2014;Due to manual labeling and other reasons;  it is difficult to ensure that the labels of industrial data samples are completely accurate. At present;  a useful method is to use a label probability transition matrix to correct the model loss function;  so that the model can learn the inaccurate labeled samples robustly. Based on the different distribution of feature representation in the model between accurate category samples and inaccurate category samples;  we introduce the Gaussian mixture model to carry out the feature representation and estimate the label probability transition matrix. In addition;  a large number of unlabeled samples are available in the industry. In this article;  the inaccurate label data samples and incomplete label data samples are modeled using WS-MLP model. The performances of the estimated label probability transition matrix and WS-MLP model are validated by two industrial examples.
