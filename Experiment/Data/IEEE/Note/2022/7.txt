/i>\nâ€”This article aims at contributing to the enhancement of the core functionalities of Automatic Train Control (ATC) systems and;  in particular;  of the Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) module;  which is included in ATC systems. In general;  the ATS module allows to automate the train traffic supervision and consequently the rescheduling of the railway traffic in case of unexpected events. However;  the implementation of an efficient rescheduling technique that automatically and rapidly provides the control actions necessary to restore the railway traffic operations to the nominal schedule is still an open issue. Most literature contributions fail in providing rescheduling methods that successfully determine high-quality solutions in less than one minute and include real-time information regarding the large-scale railway system state. This research proposes a semi-heuristic control algorithm based on MPC that;  on the one hand;  overcomes the limitations of manual rescheduling (i.e.;  suboptimal;  stressful;  and delayed decisions) and;  on the other hand;  offers the advantages of online and closed-loop control of railway traffic based on continuous monitoring of the traffic state to rapidly restore railway traffic operations to the nominal schedule. The semi-heuristic procedure permits to significantly reduce the computation time necessary to solve the rescheduling problem compared with an exact procedure; moreover;  the use of a distributed optimization approach permits the application of the algorithm to large instances of the rescheduling problem;  and the inclusion of both the traffic and rolling stock constraints related to the disrupted area. The method is tested on a realistic simulation environment;  thus still requires further refinements for the integration into a real ATS system. Further developments will also consider the occurrence of various simultaneous disruptions in the network.
