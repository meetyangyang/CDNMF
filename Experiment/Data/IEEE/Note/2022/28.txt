/i>&#x2014;To fend off the outbreak of epidemics;  the lessons have to be learned from the past. The successful control of the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan (China) is a classical example of applying modern medical practices and management tools. In the present article;  the treating procedure of COVID-19 in Wuhan is modeled as a multistage decision problem;  which includes the screening with nucleic acid testing;  the further testing;  the treatment of patients with mild/severe symptoms;  or even critical patients. The introduction of Fangcang shelter hospital is crucial for winning the battle against COVID-19. The current study attempts to determine the timing of introducing the Fangcang shelter hospital during the outbreak of a major epidemic;  and helps allocate the medical resources needed to contain the spread of the virus. It is discovered that the actual number of beds in the Fangcang shelter hospital is far more than what is necessary;  and it would be better to have built the Fangcang some time in advance. In the meantime;  the number of designated hospitals for COVID-19 is in line with the results obtained via the optimal staffing strategy proposed here;  but it is also noticeable that these hospitals should be released of duty sooner to fight against not only COVID-19 but also other diseases in reality.
