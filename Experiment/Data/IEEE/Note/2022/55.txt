/i>\nâ€”Condition-based monitoring schemes are widely applicable to rotating machines in various industries since they operate in tough working situations;  and consequently;  unpredicted failures occur. These unpredicted failures may cause perilous accidents in the industries. CBM systems prevent such failures;  which results in the reduction of equipment damage and;  hence;  increases machinery lifetime. Modern industries are so complex and generating huge data;  and these data can be collected using sensors;  but placing a large number of sensors is difficult and expensive for different but similar kinds of faults in industries. This also increases the cost due to additional sensors and circuits. In this article;  the authors have proposed a novel low-level knowledge transfer framework using the deep neural network (DNN)-based method for condition monitoring of machines in variable running conditions. Low-level features have been extracted to reduce the computations of DNN drastically with improved performance. This article also considered additional faults in the target domain;  which is more practical in real-time applications. The proposed scheme has been validated with three case studies on acoustic and vibration signatures.
