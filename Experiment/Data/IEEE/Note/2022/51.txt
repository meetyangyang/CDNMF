/i>\n—This article was motivated by the transmission efficiency and the stability of ultrasonic vibration in the rotary ultrasonic machining (RUM). The matching issue is critical in RUM because the whole system is very complicated with multiple components such as electrical devices;  piezoelectric rings;  and mechanical horn. In the conventional RUM;  the system matching is limited to a single resonant frequency between the piezoelectric transducer and the electrical driver. However;  the impedance matching is also important to influence the ultrasonic vibration. The problem of the ultrasonic matching stems from empirical experiences of the engineers’ or simple heuristic rules instead of advanced approaches. On the other hand;  optimization-based techniques are viewed as a great success in industrial and engineering applications. With the assistance of our proposed numerical model and the corresponding simulation;  we found that the multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) can intelligently search the optimal compensated parameters to achieve the double matching for both the resonant frequency and the impedance in the RUM system. Finally;  our experiments prove that the MOGA optimization can attain optimal transmission efficiency for the electrical voltage and current compared with conventional approaches. This significantly benefits the application of the RUM technology in industry;  especially for the precision machining of the hard and brittle materials.
