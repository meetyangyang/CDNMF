/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the desire to automate tasks in radiation work spaces of nuclear facilities;  particularly laboratory facilities such as those at Los Alamos National Laboratory. While there is a great deal of prior literature dealing with the simple problem of collecting radiation readings in some regular spatial patterns;  there remains the more advanced problem of inferring characteristics of the radiation sources. The localization problem has been studied in academia;  but the developed solutions fall short of being practically deployable in real facilities. Our goal with this work is to enhance the sophistication of the radiation data analysis and modeling in order to shrink the gap between the state of the art and the demands of the target environments.
