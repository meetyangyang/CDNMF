/i>&#x2014;We address a scheduling problem of dual-gripper robotic cells with two-part types when all machines have processing time variations. We propose an RL approach to obtain an efficient robot task sequence in order to minimize makespan. The proposed method is performed offline;  and a robot task sequence is then obtained instantaneously. The proposed method performs better than the FIFO rule used in practice and the swap sequence used for cyclic scheduling of robotic cells. It can be easily extended for scheduling other configurations of robotic cells.
