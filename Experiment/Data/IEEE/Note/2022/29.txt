/i>&#x2014;In the event of an outbreak of a new infectious disease;  the uncertainty of the epidemic parameters limits the ability of the model to provide accurate predictions. However;  decision-makers cannot wait for more information to alleviate this uncertainty and must immediately make decisions to control the epidemic. This article proposes a sequential decision-making approach with an innovative <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$SEI^{3}H^{2}RD$ </tex-math></inline-formula> spread model and a risk-averse scenario-based stochastic programming to help decision-makers arrive at real-time decisions. We illustrate the performance of this approach using the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. The results show that our model predictions closely fit the real outbreak data and prove that our decision approach could reduce the cost of using the available resources and achieve the goal of controlling the epidemic. The proposed modeling framework can be adopted to study other infectious diseases and provide tangible policy recommendations for controlling outbreaks of such diseases.
