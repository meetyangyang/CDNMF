/i>&#x2014;This article is motivated by the biomedical applications of multi-cell arraying. The designed microfluidic devices employ passive hydrodynamics;  and the capture cavities are stretched to accommodate different numbers of cells. The whole arraying procedures are automatized using computer vision technology. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the high efficiency;  controllability of the cell quantity;  and excellent biocompatibility.
