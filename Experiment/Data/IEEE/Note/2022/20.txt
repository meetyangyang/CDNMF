/i>\nâ€”An increasing number of optical measuring instruments provide quality engineers with surface topographic data of the product;  and enable precise and accurate inspection of surface variations during the manufacturing process. However;  spatial and arbitrary geometric features on topographic data often make monitoring the surface changes a challenging task. This article proposes a new monitoring approach for detecting topographic variations in the surface. We mathematically characterize the generic behavior of the surface under the normal process;  and present a surface segmentation model to detect local variations in the surface. In practice;  our approach is applicable to real-life paper surface variations monitoring. The proposed approach is expected to provide a new idea to practitioners who work on surface topography inspection in various fields as well as the pulp industry.
