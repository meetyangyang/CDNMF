/i>&#x2014;Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests provide scope for automation and are one of the most widely used laboratory methods for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This paper is motivated by the following challenges: (1) Many countries are experiencing an acute shortage of professionals and consumables for conducting rRT-PCR tests; (2) Group sizes of existing group testing methods against COVID-19 may not be optimal;  which adversely impacts the efficiency of the screening of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; (3) Existing group testing methods do not consider the fact that the sensitivity of rRT-PCR tests usually decreases with the group size. The objective of this paper is to improve the efficiency and sensitivity of large-scale screening against COVID-19. For achieving this goal;  we propose an Adaptive Group Testing (AdaGT) algorithm;  which has the following advantages: (1) It can improve the efficiency for screening the SARS-CoV-2 virus;  mainly by adaptively adjusting its testing strategy between an individual testing strategy and a group testing strategy based upon an estimated ratio of positive samples during the screening process; (2) It can guarantee a high sensitivity of the rRT-PCR tests by determining the group sizes of the group testing strategy based upon some constraints; (3) We derive an appropriate threshold for the estimated ratio of positive samples such that the AdaGT algorithm can achieve a minimum average number of rRT-PCR tests and can be directly employed in practical applications.
