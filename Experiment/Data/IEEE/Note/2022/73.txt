/i>\nâ€”The motivation of this work is to give an answer to the growing needs for micro nanopositioning robots having a very high precision for applications in microassembly;  in the characterization of micro and nano components or biological elements;  or for minimally invasive surgery. The key contribution of the proposed work relies on the method proposed that enables to efficiently calibrate a serial 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot using only 1-D interferometric measurements;  which overcomes the need for multi-DoF;  small size;  and high-resolution sensors missing in commercial offers. Moreover;  the behavior of such novel robotic solutions is not well known;  difficult to model;  and there is a clear lack of knowledge about the main influential parameters. The method proposed in this article notably enables to achieve the full calibration of the robot (all intrinsic and extrinsic parameters identified) to reach the best positioning accuracy. This first part takes times;  and this article shows that it is then possible to adopt a less time taking procedure by only reidentifying extrinsic parameters and thus to hold these performances over long periods;  typically a week.
