/i>\nâ€”Transportation of objects is a crucial application in industrial and warehouse environments. Conveyor belts and AGVs are typically used for such applications as they provide an efficient mode of transportation of a large number of objects. However;  they may not provide the flexibility which mobile manipulators bring in for small-scale operations. The method presented in this article provides a way to increase the efficiency of operation for mobile manipulators for transportation tasks. We attempt to reduce the risks of the manipulator colliding with expensive equipment and moving obstacles by making sure that the manipulator moves only when needed for picking up objects. Moreover;  the method can be used to pick up and transport a variety of parts in different ways using a two-fingered gripper. The method can also easily incorporate different types of grippers and mobile platforms.
