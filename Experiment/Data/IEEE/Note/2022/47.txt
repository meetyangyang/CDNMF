/i>\nâ€”The motivation behind this article was the current challenges and the open issues of the vision system for the condition assessment of sewer and water pipelines. This article presents detailed reviews of the state-of-the-art of the vision system (both hardware and software) and discusses the existing problems. This survey aims to help engineers and researchers to resolve and improve the problems and extend the field of the existing automated frameworks. This article is organized in the form of a survey so that researchers can benefit and get all the useful information at a glance. This article provides a rigorous overview of typical faults;  inspection robots;  visual techniques;  and automated frameworks for the condition assessment and discusses the challenges and future research directions. The objective of this article is to create a baseline for the readers to acquaint themselves with the state of the art and advance the research in this field.
