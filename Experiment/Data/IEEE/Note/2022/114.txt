/i>&#x2014;We are moving toward more renewable energy-based cyber-physical power grids;  and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the limits of the balance between more renewable energy integration versus changing the prime-mover in thermal power generation units to meet uncertain load demands. This article proposes a new load frequency control (LFC) scheme employing a nonlinear dead-zone element between the control signals and the actuators (prime movers);  which allows the utilization of the available renewable energy sources (RESs) to meet the load and then send a set-point change command in the thermal power generators if the RES does not meet the load. The robustness of the smart grid stability is also verified with the denial-of-service (DoS)-type cyberattack;  which is represented in the form of high probability of packet drops and stochastic time delays in the communication channels between the control center and the generation units. It is also essential to understand how different stochastic profiles may affect the stability and performance of the tuned LFC loops;  under random time delays and packet dropouts. These are quantified using the uncertainty bounds of grid frequency;  its rate of change;  control inputs;  and power exchange between the two areas that are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations with different types of nonstationary load and RES profiles and also using real data to show the effectiveness of the LFC scheme with communication constraints and the resulting imperfections.
