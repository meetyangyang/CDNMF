/i>&#x2014;This article is motivated by the markedly increasing applications of mobile health (mHealth) in cardiac care. MHealth systems enable the real-time monitoring;  tracking;  and transmitting of heart-health information but suffer from the problem with limited battery life. This article presents a novel energy-efficient framework for mobile ECG sensing by integrating ECG signal analysis with sensing-policy optimization under the constraint of the energy budget. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework to realize energy-efficient mobile sensing for cardiac events detection.
