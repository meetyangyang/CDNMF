/i>&#x2014;This article is motivated by the emerging need for developing effective methods to support policymakers in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed feedback control strategy&#x2014;combining a multiregion epidemiological model with a nonlinear stochastic model predictive control approach&#x2014;allows the robust identification of the most effective restrictive measures considering the corresponding effects on the healthcare and socioeconomic systems. The proposed framework is a general and flexible method that can be applied to various real scenarios;  leveraging mobility data;  available from the Google mobility service;  to recognize patterns and predict future behaviors of individuals.
