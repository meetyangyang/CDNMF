/i>\nâ€”Defect inspection is a key process in wafer fabrication for identifying and inspecting the patterning defects generated during the complicated fabrication processes. Electron beam inspection (EBI) takes place of optical inspection gradually as the design rules keep shrinking and the circuits are more susceptible to nanoscale killer defects. Low throughput is the main drawback of EBI and the improvements on throughput have far-reaching significance on the high volume manufacturing of semiconductor products. This study aims to reduce the number of inspection regions to improve the total inspection time in the EBI process. Considering that the inspection time for each inspection region is constant;  less inspection regions means less total inspection time. However;  the positions of inspection regions are arbitrary across the continuous planar space;  putting pressure on modeling and solving the problem. A preprocessing algorithm is designed to discover a limited number of candidate positions of inspection regions without loss of optimality;  which greatly simplifies the problem. For dealing with large-scale instances;  an approximation algorithm combining linear programming (LP)-rounding technique and greedy strategy is designed to get near optimal solutions. Since the number of inspection regions is one key factor determining the total inspection time;  the proposed optimization methods have a potential to be applicable to enhance the efficiency of advanced EBI platforms;  such as ASML HMI eP series.
