/i>&#x2014;There are some works using features from the 3-D point cloud;  e.g.;  corners;  planes;  and reflectance;  for robot localization. Instead of the abstract features;  this article presents an object-feature-based localization scheme. We propose a novel pole-like object extraction algorithm based on the spatial distribution of the 3-D points. This algorithm can extract most types of pole-like objects in the urban environment. As these objects are highly distinct from other types of objects in their surroundings;  localization is achieved by associating the pole-like features in the map and the features detected in real time through maximizing the likelihood. The whole system is verified with data collected in the real world;  which indicates that its accuracy can fulfill the requirements of autonomous driving. The limitation of the proposed method is that it highly depends on one specific type of feature;  which may not work well in the rural environment. In future research;  we will address this problem by incorporating more types of semantic features for localization.
