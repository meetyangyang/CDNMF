/i>\n—Process data;  such as temperature;  pressure;  speed;  etc.;  are capable of directly showing degradation trends of degraded systems and components. “Data-level” fusion models can be directly used to fuse process data from multiple sensors to show a better-fused degradation trend than a sole trend obtained from an individual process data sensor. Being different from process data;  nonprocess data;  such as vibration and acoustic data;  cannot be used to directly show degradation trends unless they are transformed into a health index. One of the benefits of nonprocess data is that they have been proved to be sensitive to incipient machine faults. Nevertheless;  due to complicated transmission paths and multiple responses;  transforming nonprocess data into a health index is still a challenging task. This article presents a methodology to fuse spectrum amplitudes to form a health index that can simultaneously detect incipient machine faults and assess monotonic machine degradation. The main idea of this article is to regard each spectrum amplitude as “an individual sensor” and the sum of weighted spectrum amplitudes as a health index. To implement the proposed methodology;  it is necessary: 1) to transform temporal nonprocess data into frequency spectra by using the well-known Fourier transform; 2) to know two essential properties about detecting incipient machine faults and assessing machine degradation; and 3) to train weights based on the essential properties by any convex optimization algorithms. Once optimal weights are obtained;  the health index has ability to simultaneously detect incipient machine faults and monotonically assess machine degradation.
