/i>&#x2014;The railway system is a safety-critical system. System safety is essential to the railway system. It is necessary to provide formal methods to model the system and analyze its properties. The motivation of this work is to present a general modeling framework of railway systems for the crucial states estimation. The crucial states estimation of the railway system has not been discussed yet in the literature despite its importance due to its relationship with the safety of the railway. In particular;  estimating the crucial states in the railway system helps to determine whether there are potential risks in the system. In this paper;  we investigate a new state estimation property (C-detectability);  which is related to fault diagnosis;  marking estimation and fault identification. Future research will consider the use of timed Petri nets to increase the modeling power and to allow the performance analysis of the railway system.
