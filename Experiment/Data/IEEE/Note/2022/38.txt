/i>&#x2014;This work extends previous research and development of an automated aircraft guidance system for infrastructure inspection;  by addressing the problem of automated flight planning. Often;  deploying manned or automated aircraft reliably and efficiently for large-scale inspection is a challenge. Designing efficient flight paths and missions by hand is complex and time-consuming. Traditional &#x201C;top-down&#x201D; planning approaches use region or waypoint-based planning;  neglecting the spatial layout of the assets to be inspected;  possibly leading to more missions than required;  inefficient flight paths;  or missed data capture. Since inspecting a large asset with few aircraft can take many days;  a solution was sought that can plan across multiple time scales (from second to second path planning to daily mission planning). A solution was designed that can build flight plans automatically from the &#x201C;bottom-up&#x201D; while optimizing performance objectives and satisfying constraints. Flight plans can either be used to aid pilots conducting an aerial inspection;  as input to an automated line-tracking system for aircraft or UAVs or for estimating the cost of large-scale inspection operations. The presented method and results are motivated by the specific problem of large-scale powerline inspection and the approach may be applied to the inspection of other above-ground infrastructures;  such as roads and railways.
