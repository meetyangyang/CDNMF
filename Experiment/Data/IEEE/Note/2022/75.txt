/i>\nâ€”As robots move into our warehouses;  workplaces;  and homes;  it is important to develop robotic controls that are intuitive and easy for novices to use. In particular;  teleoperation can be valuable to guide robots when they encounter situations that autonomous programs are not prepared to deal with. In this article;  we focus specifically on robotic grasping using nonanthropomorphic hands. Our method is intended for novice users to intuitively teleoperate such robots. We show that the teleoperation subspace we use can effectively enable pick-and-place tasks and in-hand manipulation tasks and that it is intuitive for novice operators. Our subspace outperforms state-of-the-art methods for pick-and-place tasks and performs as well as state-of-the-art methods for in-hand manipulation.
