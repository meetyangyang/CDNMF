/i>\nâ€”Robotic cellular manufacturing (RCM) systems are among the most common and complicated discrete-event dynamic systems;  which provide a great number of choices of resources and processing routes to allow high system productivity. Timed Petri nets (PNs) and intelligent search algorithms on their reachability graphs are ideal tools to handle the RCM scheduling problem. This work proposes an A* search method based on the evolutions of timed PNs to optimally schedule RCM systems. The proposed method can deal with token remaining time;  weighted arcs;  and multiple resource copies often encountered in the PN models of RCM systems.
