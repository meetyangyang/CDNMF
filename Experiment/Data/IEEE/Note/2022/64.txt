/i>\n—This work was motivated by the challenge of inspecting aerospace components;  which is almost entirely done manually at present. Rather than replacing human inspectors;  this work aims at reducing their workload by providing them with an initial inspection result for each component. Especially;  the proposed system is able to first localize the Region of Interest (RoI) from an X-ray image of a component and then identify potential defects contained in the RoI. To the best of our knowledge;  few existing studies perform defect detection on raw component images. Normally;  researchers manually cropped an RoI from these images. The output of our system is the pixelwise location information on potential defects. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system is able to accurately localize the weld and identify 80% of defects contained in abnormal weld images with very few false positives. Given that large weld images (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$2304\\times1920$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n pixels) were processed;  our system located the weld in 6.6± 1.3 s/image and fulfilled defect detection on each localized weld region in 0.8± 0.1 s. The proposed system was also tested with the publicly available X-ray weld image data set: GDXray and a magnetic tile image data set. Although only a small number of training images were available;  promising results were obtained. This suggests that our system is suitable for both X-ray weld images and other images though more work is needed to reduce false positives.
