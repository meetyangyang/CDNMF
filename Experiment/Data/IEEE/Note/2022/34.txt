/i>&#x2014;Observatories involved in the generation of spectroscopic surveys always encounter limited resources to check the throughputs of their planned observations before their executions. The information yielded by an observation directly depends on the convergence rate of the observatory&#x2019;s astrobots in that particular observation. Namely;  if the astrobots&#x2019; convergence rate is below a minimum;  then the observation has to be revoked and replanned. Thus;  one may define another observation that fulfills the minimum-information requirement. There has been yet no analytical tool developed to verify the convergence rate of the coordination computed by the state-of-the-art trajectory planners of astrobots swarms. Thus;  we propose to use a machine learning scheme to predict the desired convergence rate instead of involving in the infeasible process of finding its exact value. This method is a supervised method that requires the target-to-astrobot assignments table of an observation. The algorithm also needs a data set including previous coordination results of various observations of a particular swarm. The simulated scenarios manifest magnificent accuracies in the convergence predictions of some astrobots swarms corresponding to modern spectroscopic surveys;  such as SDSS-V (including &#x007E;500 astrobots). Our strategy is based on the smallest subset of the astrobots&#x2019; features that have a pivotal role in convergence rates;  say;  the projected positions of targets on a hosting telescope&#x2019;s focal plane. We argue that more explorations have to be considered to find other important features;  such as the motion direction of each astrobot;  which may even further improve the obtained prediction accuracies.
