/i>\nâ€”The motivation of this article is to solve the problem of automatic deformation control of soft objects in restricted environments. The existing soft object deformation control is achieved using rigid robots in an open environment;  but rigid robots are difficult to use in specific applications where the environment is restricted (e.g.;  natural orifice surgery). Flexible continuum robots with mechanical compliance can manipulate soft objects in narrow spaces. However;  due to environmental constraints;  the robot body may be deformed into any shape regardless of the input of the actuator. To solve the problem;  this research provides a new visual servo control strategy that deforms soft objects using a continuum robot in a restricted environment. The proposed method can control a flexible robot to manipulate soft objects while taking into account the change in the robot configuration in a restricted environment.
