/i>\nâ€”The low-level automation control system in the modern manufacturing scenarios require more agility while respecting strict timing constraints. Handling such complexity with manual coding is getting harder and less efficient. The DSML and the supporting development environment presented in this article aim to enhance the level of automation;  flexibility;  and dependability of the whole design process. For the proposed DSML;  its syntax is formalized and defined as metamodels;  while the semantics is integrated through model annotation and transformation. These definitions are implemented as external rules for a metaprogrammable environment to establish our proposed development tool. The finding and insight from this article can enhance efficiency and dependability during the development of common control kernels;  such as CNC kernel and motion controller.
