/i>&#x2014;This work considers joint optimization of both ATLP and average energy cost of all clouds. It is of great significance to execute tasks among multiple clouds by jointly allocating all tasks among multiple web portals and specifying suitable servers in different clouds. Yet;  it is challenging to achieve joint optimization in a market where factors;  including prices of electricity and available servers;  show spatial variations. Current studies are coarse-grained and fail to jointly achieve average energy cost minimization and quality-of-service optimization of tasks. In this work;  a novel algorithm named adaptive simulated-annealing-based biobjective differential evolution is proposed for an energy cost and quality-of-service-optimized task scheduling strategy in a real-time manner. Experiments prove that it realizes lower energy cost and ATLP compared with its typical widely used peers. It can also be applied to other industrial areas;  including smart manufacturing;  Internet of Things;  and smart city.
