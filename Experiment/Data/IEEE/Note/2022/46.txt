/i>\nâ€”Run-to-run (RtR) control has been widely applied in batch manufacturing processes to reduce variation and has been identified as a turn-key technology for maintaining quality outputs in semiconductor manufacturing. The mixed-product production mode poses a great challenge of how to adjust process recipes between different products to alleviate initial recipe bias;  process shifts;  and patterned disturbances from run to run;  product to product;  and cycle to cycle. The proposed mixed-product RtR controller is developed based on a novel disturbance-accumulating;  product-based strategy. This new controller is easy to implement in practice and has been shown to be effective in producing high-quality control outputs.
