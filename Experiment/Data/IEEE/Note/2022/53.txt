/i>\nâ€”In this article;  we develop a joint ordering and markdown policy for perishable products deployed on two shelves: a regular shelf for fresh products and a markdown shelf for less fresh products. Although the closed-form policy is obtained for the one-period situation with deterministic demand;  it is not difficult to extend it to the multiperiod case with random demand. This article not only reveals the underlying reason of employing both regular shelf and markdown shelf in the practice of retailing management for perishable products but also proposes an easy-to-implement ordering and markdown policy;  which will bring higher profit than the traditional one-shelf policy and will improve the performance of managing a perishable products retailing system.
