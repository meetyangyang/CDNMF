/i>&#x2014;This article discusses a way to handle human safety specifications versus production requirements in collaborative robotized assembly systems. State-of-the-art (SoA) approaches cover only a few aspects of both human detection and robot speed scaling. The present research work proposes a complete pipeline that starts from a robust human tracking algorithm and scales the robot speed in real time. An innovative multimodal perception system composed of two depth cameras and a thermal camera monitors the collaborative workspace. The speed scaling algorithm is optimized to take on different human behaviors during less risky situations or more dangerous ones to guarantee both operator safety and minimum production time with the aim of better profitability and efficiency for collaborative workstations. The algorithm estimates the operator intention for real-time computation of the minimum protective distance according to the current safety regulations. The robot speed is smoothly changed for the psychological advantages of operators;  both in the case of single and multiple workers. The result is a complete system;  easily implementable on a standard industrial workcell.
