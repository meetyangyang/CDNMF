/i>\nâ€”In energy-intensive manufacturing enterprises;  reducing the energy consumption in their production systems is urgent and challenging. In this article;  an energy consumption optimization problem in a simple model of production systems (i.e.;  in the two-machine Bernoulli line) is investigated. Machine efficiencies are optimized so that the total energy consumption of machines is minimized;  while a required production rate is ensured. The reported results enable a novel managerial paradigm for production systems;  especially for energy-intensive systems. Although the model of the two-machine Bernoulli line is simple;  as a cornerstone;  this research will be extended;  in the future;  to long Bernoulli lines and more practical production systems;  e.g.;  lines with geometric;  exponential;  and non-exponential machine reliability models.
