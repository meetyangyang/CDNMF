/i>&#x2014;In the industry;  homologous unknown inputs (UIs) exist in many different systems. For example;  the same ambient temperature affects the performance of every battery in a battery pack. Similarly;  the same wind power can affect different aircrafts flying in the same region. Temperature and wind power can be considered the homologous UIs of a multiagent system. Estimation of homologous UIs is important because of the latter&#x2019;s massive impact on the system. In this study;  data transmission delay and packet loss are ignored. Hence;  the study is limited to low-rate systems. Moreover;  nonlinear filters must be studied further in future work.
