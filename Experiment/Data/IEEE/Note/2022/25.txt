/i>&#x2014;The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been causing enormous damage to people&#x2019;s health;  jobs;  and well-being. COVID-19 has affected almost all countries globally and has changed the operation mode of the healthcare system;  especially the hospitals. The hospitals are the frontlines of healthcare service and the battle with the COVID-19 pandemic. This article is motivated by our collaborations with hospitals in Shanghai;  China. In China;  many hospitals establish buffer zones: a monitored area where the patients who need hospitalizations after the quick treatments in the emergency department can temporarily wait for the Covid-19 test and receive some healthcare services to stabilize their conditions. Because the zone&#x2019;s capacity is limited;  the managers must make dynamic patient admission control decisions according to multiple factors;  such as patients&#x2019; health conditions and the usage of beds in the zone. We propose two MDP models to solve this complex problem. Several iteration algorithms are designed to solve the MDP models and obtain the optimal and threshold policies. Based on hospitals&#x2019; real-life data;  we show the methods presented in this paper can help hospital managers make more reasonable decisions. Although we focus on the hospital&#x2019;s buffer zone in China;  the methodology and approach for this problem can be extended to other practical hospital management scenarios in the coronavirus pandemic. For example;  For example;  some hospitals have admission control problems for coronavirus patients due to hospital capacity limitations. The hospital has to decide if a patient is accepted as an inpatient or suggested to home quarantine. In such a case;  the admission control problem can also be solved by the methodologies in the paper.
