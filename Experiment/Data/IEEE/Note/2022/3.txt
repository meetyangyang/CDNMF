/i>\n—In the past decade;  particular attention has been posed on EVs and renewable resources to reduce pollutants’ emissions. Critical issues regard the setting of adequate recharging infrastructure and the integration of huge distributed and intermittent loads and production into the electrical grid. This article aims to provide a bi-level optimization model that can be used by companies or public administrations that want to install charging stations in a territory. In particular;  the transportation and the electrical networks are integrated: at a lower level;  the UE traffic assignment conditions are derived to represent users’ choices and to assess the energy demand. At the upper level;  an optimization problem is formalized;  to minimize costs of installation and power losses and to maximize benefits;  which embeds as constraints the UE conditions for the case of EVs and the model of the electrical grid (load flow equations;  bounds over-voltage;  apparent power;  etc.).
