/i>\n—This article was motivated by our previous experiences in the Amazon Robotics Challenge (ARC) competitions as a participant. Although the major lessons from those events revealed many important issues toward warehouse automation both from robotic vision and grasping aspects;  the application aspects of control engineering to solution for these real-world problems could significantly benefit the today’s highly automated society. The intention of this article is to address this situation by designing a cost-effective robot manipulator control scheme by optimizing robot manipulation trajectories in the outer loop along with the actuator input in the inner loop. Therefore;  we propose a dual-loop optimal control scheme for robotic manipulations under a cost-optimal framework with guaranteed stability proof via the Lyapunov approach. This results in smoother trajectories with cost-effective control actuator inputs than the state-of-the-art methods. We believe that this work can be beneficial for academic and industrial research to design more advanced and optimized solutions in this domain.
