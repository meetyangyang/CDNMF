This article is motivated by the problem of high cost of application of systems with computing units redundancy based on dedicated components;  such as the latest S7-1500R/H Redundant System by Siemens or PACSystems Profinet System Redundancy by Emerson (former GE IP). The above solutions are powerful and sophisticated. However;  sometimes;  simpler solutions would suffice. This article shows how a system with computing unit redundancy could be built in a cost-effective way and;  at the same time;  provide all the basic features expected from systems with redundancy;  i.e.;  fault detection;  automatic switchover;  and synchronization. All this is done with a common embedded programmable device and an open Ethernet-based communication network.
