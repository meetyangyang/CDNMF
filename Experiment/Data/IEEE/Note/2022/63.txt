/i>\nâ€”A high-fidelity mathematical model is of critical importance to the implementation of any model-based production system analysis method. Currently;  the construction of such models is carried out in an ad hoc manner. The quality of the resulting models may heavily depend on the training;  experience;  intuition;  and personal preference of the modeler. The proposed model parameter identification method focuses on standard key performance indices commonly measured on the factory floor. The advantage is twofold. First;  these standard performance metrics are consistently defined regardless of industry;  thus avoiding any data-ambiguity issue that may occur when using complex machine/equipment status data. Second;  measuring these performance metrics in real time is typically convenient and cost effective;  even for manufacturing plants without high-end IT infrastructure;  thus making the technology accessible to not only large but also small- and mid-sized manufacturers. Using the algorithms developed in this article;  a practitioner can quickly construct a serial production line model and then utilize it to access the rich library of production analysis;  design;  and control methods available in the literature.
