/i>\n—This paper was motivated by the problem of sequencing patients daily for ancillary service providers (ASPs) on an inpatient unit (IU). This work is applicable to such ASPs as care managers and therapists. We derive patient sequencing strategies (rules);  which they can apply to prioritize their patient workload in such a way that upstream patient boarding time is minimized without affecting the promptness of care for recurring and newly arriving patients. We develop a mathematical model that faithfully captures an ASP’s workload dynamics and a heuristic approach to derive easy-to-use;  sequencing strategies. An experimental study using retrospective data and interviews with ASPs from a large teaching hospital in the Northeast U.S. led to a set of strategies to prioritize patients in order to minimize upstream boarding. This set is;  however;  sensitive to the total number of: 1) patients in the unit; 2) patients ready to be discharged; and 3) patients with tighter due dates. For instance;  an increase in the number of patients and/or discharges tends to move the discharge patients ahead in the sequence. Among several realistic strategies we experimented with;  we found one single strategy (newly arrived and recurring patients that have pressing constraints;  then discharges;  then all other patients) that appeared to perform close to our proposed set of strategies. However;  care must be taken when implementing this single strategy;  as missing a discharge cutoff for nonhome patients (as may occur) may lead to an additional overnight stay. Our findings also suggest that the ASP should consider the workload in the IU when sequencing discharges;  instead of a myopic view of their own workload.
