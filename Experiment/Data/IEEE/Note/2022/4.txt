/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the problems that an electric distribution system is facing today due to the penetration of electric vehicles and battery storage systems (BSSs). The presence of a large number of electric vehicles (EVs) and BSSs is causing a substantial degradation of the quality and reliability of the power grid. Despite the adverse effects;  EVs and BSSs can be controlled and used as a power source to benefit the grid. Also;  this control of EVs and BSS cannot be done by a centralized body since this would be nonscalable and would require huge communication bandwidth. To tackle this ever scaling problem;  this article develops a continuous-domain multiagent distributed algorithm to control the EVs and BSSs and utilize them to maintain the grid voltage within the normal operating range while also satisfying the consumers by maximizing their welfare. The algorithm was developed in the continuous domain since;  in most of the other algorithms that are iterative and in discrete time;  the accuracy of the optimal solution greatly depends on the sampling time;  and thus;  it is not robust to changes that are prevalent with distributed energy resources such as EVs and BSSs.
