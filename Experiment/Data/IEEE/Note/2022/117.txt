/i> Automated plant disease diagnosis systems play an important role in the agricultural automation field. Building a practical image-based automatic plant diagnosis system requires collecting a wide variety of disease images with reliable label information. However;  it is quite labor-intensive. Conventional systems have reported relatively high diagnosis performance;  but most of their scores were largely biased due to the &#x201C;latent similarity&#x201D; between training and test images;  and their true diagnosis capabilities were much lower than claimed. To address this issue;  we propose LeafGAN;  which generates countless diverse and high-quality training images; it works as an efficient data augmentation for the diagnosis classifier. Such generated images can be used as useful resources for improving the performance of the cucumber disease diagnosis systems.
