/i>\nâ€”This article was motivated by the problem of minimizing fuel consumption in thrust allocation of DP systems. The current approaches simplify this issue by adopting simpler;  yet related;  optimization problems as surrogates;  keeping the problem tractable for near-real-time control. We propose;  instead;  to solve the original problem with state-of-the-art modelization of the physical system and exploit reasonable and theoretical proprietaries to achieve optimal solutions in near-real-time. The results on a drilling unit will show additional fuel savings of up to 5% with respect to alternative state-of-the-art approaches.
