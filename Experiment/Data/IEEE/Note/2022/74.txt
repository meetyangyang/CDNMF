/i>\n—This article is motivated by the problem of dexterous robotic arm control based on a brain–computer interface (BCI). For people suffering from severe neuromuscular disorders or accident injuries;  a brain-controlled robotic arm is expected to provide assistance in their daily lives. A primary bottleneck to achieve the objective is that the information transfer rate of current BCIs is not high enough to produce multiple and reliable commands during the online robotic control. In this work;  machine autonomy is incorporated in a BCI-controlled robotic arm system;  where the user and machine can work together to reach and grasp multiple objects in a given task. The intelligent robot system autonomously localized the potential targets and provided trajectory correction and grasping assistance accordingly. Meanwhile;  the user only needed to complete gross reaching movement and target selection with a basic binary motor imagery-based BCI;  which reduced the task difficulty and retained the volitional involvement of the user at the same time. The results of the experiments showed that the accuracy and efficiency of grasping tasks increased significantly in the shared control mode together with a significant decrease in the perceived mental workload;  which indicates that our proposed shared control system is effective and user-friendly in practice. In the future;  more feedback information will be introduced to enhance the task performance further;  and a wheelchair-mounted robotic arm system will be developed for greater flexibility. In addition;  more functional task modules (e.g.;  self-feeding and opening doors) should be integrated for more practical utilities.
