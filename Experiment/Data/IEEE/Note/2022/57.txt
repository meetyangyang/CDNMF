/i>\nâ€”In practice;  scheduling is one of the most important issues for production managers to address. Existing approaches to deadlock-prone flexible manufacturing system (FMS) scheduling have multiparameters. Their settings can impact the scheduling results greatly. Since their turning is a challenging task;  it is difficult to find the best parameter settings. This article proposes an anytime branch and bound (AB&B) algorithm for minimizing the makespan of deadlock-prone FMSs. It has only one parameter;  i.e.;  maximal CPU time;  which needs no turning. When it is highly tight;  AB&B can output a feasible and decent schedule. If it is larger and larger;  AB&B can output a better and better schedule. Comparison studies show that AB&B outclasses existing ones significantly. It is suitable for real-time scheduling cases in which satisfied schedules must be offered in a very short time.
