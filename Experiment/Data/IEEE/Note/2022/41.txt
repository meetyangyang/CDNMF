/i>&#x2014;Task allocation in human&#x2013;robot collaboration (HRC) systems is challenging because robots and humans are heterogeneous in advantages and drawbacks. Robots;  despite recent development;  are not comparable to humans in reliability. However;  human working hours are generally more expensive. When the HRC systems have high robot-to-human ratios and are required to work for long periods;  the amount of decision-making (DM) problems of assigning a task to a robot or a human is enormous. Hence;  the DM process needs to be automated. It was found that the performance of a team is improved when all the team members share the same mental models. Therefore;  in human-centered automation;  the characteristics of human DM should be shared with robots. For this purpose;  in this article we propose a human-like DM model. We first discuss the psychological effects that influence human DM under risk. We transfer these effects to the building components of the mathematical human-like DM model. However;  the details of the components are undetermined. We then design the algorithms to measure these components quantitatively. We test the prediction accuracy of the automated DM model and show it is significantly more human-like than the traditional DM method. The proposed algorithms can be used for designing human-like DM models in applications that involve allocating tasks between humans and robots;  such as collaborative search;  collaborative assembly;  and so on.
