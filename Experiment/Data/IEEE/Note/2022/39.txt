/i>&#x2014;Micropatterning is an effective tool for pharmaceutical research and drug discovery. However;  the reliability of results depends on the quality of patterns. Existing approaches;  such as microfluidic devices;  are limited to create a pattern from one chip for single use;  and the entire process is sealed and isolated from the environment. In this study;  a multielectrode microchip combined with a vision-based micromanipulator is introduced to create a novel noncontact approach for microparticle patterning;  which offers high flexibility and guarantees the quality of the constructed patterns. The electrodes on the chip can be selectively energized to determine the shape of the final pattern. A real-time screening is performed so that the micromanipulator will only guide the particles in good condition for selection. An optimization algorithm is implemented to aid the particle selection with the electrodes;  allowing high-quality microparticle patterns to be constructed in a short time for various applications.
