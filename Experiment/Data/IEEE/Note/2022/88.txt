/i>\nâ€”Decentralized control is a means of distributing the control of a complex system away from a central computing source toward individual devices and subsystems. In material handling;  complex systems can malfunction due to deadlock;  livelock;  or starvation. This article presents a new method for controlling decentralized material handling systems based on logical time;  a method from computer operating systems describing a sequence of activities at each resource. We modify logical time for material handling and show that the system is deadlock-free;  thus giving engineers an easy-to-implement method of controlling route-based material handling systems such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) or conveyors.
