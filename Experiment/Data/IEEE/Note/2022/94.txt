/i>&#x2014;The two-stage program with distribution uncertainty is an important decision problem in broad applications;  e.g.;  two-stage schedule problems;  facility location problems;  and recourse allocation problems. To deal with the uncertainty;  this work proposes a novel data-driven model over the 1-Wasserstein ball and develops an efficient second-order conic programming (SOCP)-based solution approach;  where the sample data set can be easily exploited to reduce the distribution uncertainty. The good out-of-sample performance and computational complexity of the proposed model are validated by the experiments on the two-stage portfolio programs and material order programs.
