/i>\nâ€”This article is motivated by the emerging need for effective network reconfiguration approaches in modern power distribution systems;  including microgrids. The proposed metaheuristic optimization strategy allows the decision maker (i.e.;  the distribution system operator) to determine in reasonable time the optimal network topology;  minimizing the overall power losses and considering the system operational requirements. The proposed optimization framework is generic and flexible;  as it can be applied to different architectures both of large distribution networks (DNs) and microgrids;  considering various types of system objectives and technical constraints. The presented strategy can be implemented in any decision support system or engineering software for power grids;  providing decision makers with an effective information and communication technology tool for the optimal planning of the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of DNs.
