/i>\nâ€”High-speed train always runs periodically on the same railway;  e.g.;  the same tunnels;  slopes;  and bridges;  according to the scheduling plans developed by the railway department. Due to the repetitive operation pattern;  the iterative learning control has the prospect of becoming an inherent method for devising the tracking controller of trains. Nevertheless;  the unknown speed delays;  which are inevitable due to the damping effect of wheel rails;  couplers;  and so on as well as the disturbance of external environments;  may degrade the performance of control system and even cause instability in severe cases. As a result;  this article exploits a compensation method to eliminate the effects of unknown delay under the iterative learning control framework;  thus guaranteeing the safety of train operation and the comfort of passengers. To enhance the practicability;  the hyperbolic tangent function is introduced to keep the continuity of control signal;  and the command filter is synthesized to reduce the complexity of controller implementation. Although the stability analysis and numerical simulations have confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme;  it is still expected to be verified by experiments in the future.
