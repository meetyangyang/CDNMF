/i>\nâ€”This article aims to develop a practical data-driven method for automatically monitoring the operational state of structures. In order to achieve consistently and highly accurate results in performing different tasks for diverse structures;  we combine underlying features in both time and frequency domains extracted from measured signal vibration data. Three popular data featuring methods are combined to achieve the diversity gain which would not be possible with each individual method. As the vibration is usually measured by long time-series signals;  the most efficient deep learning architecture for time-series signal;  namely long-short term memory (LSTM);  is considered for this work. Besides;  each structure has its own dynamic properties;  i.e.;  eigenfrequencies;  around which the most relevant information is in the frequency domain;  thus convolutional neural network specifically designed for capturing local information is used in combination with LSTM;  forming a hybrid deep learning architecture. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach are supported by three case studies with different types of structures;  showing highly accurate damage detection with reduced resource requirements. These advantages can be valuable for developing a model for live monitoring of structural health in the future life-line infrastructures.
