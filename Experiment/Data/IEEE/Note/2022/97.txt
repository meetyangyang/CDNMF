/i>&#x2014;Most scientific applications are computation and/or data-intensive and need large-scale or high-performance resources for their execution. More and more scientists use workflows to manage their applications;  but how to efficiently run them in the cloud is a big challenge due to their large scale as well as the dynamic characteristics of the elastic and heterogeneous cloud resources. In this article;  we develop a novel multiobjective optimization technique for workflow scheduling such that the makespan and cost can be minimized simultaneously. A scoring criterion;  dynamic hierarchical structure and its evolutionary rules;  and adaptive adjustment strategies are designed to cooperate with each other and increase the search ability and efficiency of the original and widely used NSGA-II. Adequate experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method&#x2019;s performance;  and the experimental results show that it can provide more near-optimal solutions than the existing methods. It can be readily applied for implementing more efficient and effective cloud data centers to execute large-scale scientific workflows.
