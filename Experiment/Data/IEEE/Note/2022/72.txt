/i>\nâ€”This work is motivated by the problem of program modules designing and task allocation in parallel and distribution systems. It can also be applied to deal with job (task) grouping problems in practical industrial applications. This article presents a novel and effective learning-based local search algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions for the considered problem. The results of numerical experiments and comparisons show that our algorithm can achieve good search performances on problem instances of different scales and difficulties. Afterward;  we use the proposed solution method to solve a real-life open-order slab assignment problem;  which is derived from the production planning of silicon steel for an iron and steel company. The learning techniques of the proposed algorithm are of general interest and can be used in search algorithms for solving other real-life optimization problems with grouping features. For future research;  we will design solution methods based on these learning techniques to address other practical optimization problems.
