/i>\nâ€”The imprecision caused by physiological hand tremor in microsurgeries has motivated researchers to innovate an efficient tremor compensating technique that can improve surgical performance. Yet;  all the existing tremor filtering algorithms;  implemented in hand-held surgical instruments;  use nonlinear phase prefilters to separate the tremor signal. The inherent phase distortion caused by such prefilters restricts the filtering performance significantly and renders the existing methods inadequate for hand-held robotic surgery. Motivated by this;  we proposed a novel estimator-predictor-based framework;  by adopting the modified recursive singular spectrum analysis estimator and the extreme learning machine predictor. The proposed framework filters the tremor signal accurately;  without distorting it;  but at a small fixed lag. In a set of rigorous testing performed by emulating real-time processing;  the proposed algorithm showed higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. This validates not only its suitability for real-time implantation but also its potential to improve surgical performance;  which has been limited by the distorted filtering. Nonetheless;  we have presented a proof-of-principle framework for distortion-free filtering;  but its full implementation in a real surgical instrument;  such as Micron or ITrem;  requires a substantial amount of experimental testing and verification. It can be also applicable in a wide range of areas;  including health-care;  digital manufacturing;  smart automation and control;  and various other robotic technologies where efficient filtering of advanced sensor data is highly desirable. In the future;  we will develop the multidimensional model of the proposed framework to enable filtering of tremor in the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>xyz</i>\n-axes simultaneously.
