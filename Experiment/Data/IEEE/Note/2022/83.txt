/i>\nâ€”Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems;  recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state;  recovering control;  is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs);  introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).
