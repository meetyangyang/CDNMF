/i>&#x2014;The &#x201C;Follow Me&#x201D; flight mode is available in many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) products;  and this technique enables a UAV to automatically follow a target. However;  this flight mode may make the UAV noticeable to the target and compromise the video surveillance missions of the UAV. Inspired by some security surveillance applications where UAV surveillance is conducted so that a target would not take actions to avoid being monitored;  we propose an efficient method to construct the trajectory for the UAV. The proposed method considers the visual covertness and the battery capacity limitation of the UAV;  and it can produce a trajectory online for the UAV. The proposed method and scenario can potentially extend the &#x201C;Follow Me&#x201D; flight mode and generate new applications and market for UAVs.
