/i>&#x2014;Rotating machines;  such as engines and motors;  are the cornerstones of the modern industry. Edge computing is an emerging computing paradigm where computation is performed on the edges of networks rather than on the central cloud;  thereby reducing system response time;  transmission overhead;  storage space;  and computation resources of the cloud. Motivated by the high demand on computation for deploying DNN models and lower computation complexity for running BDNN models and easiness for large-scale deployment of BDNNs;  an edge computing-based method for real-time fault diagnosis of rotating machines is proposed. First;  we design a BDNN-based feature extractor to decrease the amount of computation and speed up a diagnosis processes. Then;  the resulting binary features are fed to train an RF-based classifier;  where we use ReliefF instead of Gini index when training a random forest model to further improve the proposed method&#x2019;s diagnostic accuracy. Finally;  a novel cloud-edge collaborative computing-based fault diagnostic mode is presented;  where the model trained from the central cloud is deployed on the edge computing devices distributed in large-scale scenarios to realize real-time fault diagnosis. Experiment results show that the proposed method can maintain the desired accuracy but greatly enhance the diagnosis speed when deployed on the edge nodes near end physical machines. It is easily extended and used for fault detection in many industrial sectors.
