/i>\nâ€”This article attempted to tackle an issue derived from distributed process monitoring of industrial processes. Even in an era of big industrial data;  the fusion idea of process data and mechanism knowledge also provides a solution to the process decomposition monitoring strategy. It reduces the computational complexity;  corrects the misdirection caused by the false information hidden in the measurements;  and further increases the monitoring accuracy. Considering the information flowing and spreading along with the process equipment;  common variables are used to describe the interaction between different subsystems. Then;  the pretrained monitoring model and the online monitoring strategy are given to promote automatic implementation. The operability and monitoring accuracy of the proposed method is verified. It is suitable for process monitoring of large-scale complex industrial systems.
