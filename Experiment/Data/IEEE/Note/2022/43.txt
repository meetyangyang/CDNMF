/i>\n—This article is motivated by the problem of the pose estimation of textured and textureless objects in clutter environments. It is difficult for conventional works to address the issue of estimating textured or textureless objects’ poses in such scenarios. We considered that a novel system should be able to obtain the 6-D poses of objects. Therefore;  we investigate the combined use of multiple split functions with different characteristics. Learning the model based on Hough forests always cost much computational resource; therefore;  we construct a novel pruned Hough forest for solving this issue. Through the comparison and robotic grasp verifications;  the behavior of our system can be used in practical applications. In future;  we will deploy the proposed system in robotic assembling tasks.
