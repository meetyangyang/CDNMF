/i>\n—This article was inspired by the concerns of difficulties for electric vehicle (EV)’s fast charging and the imbalance of the utilization rate of charging facilities. Existing route optimization and charging navigation research are mainly applicable to static traffic networks;  which cannot dynamically adjust driving routes and charging strategies with real-time traffic information. Besides;  the mutual impact between vehicles is rarely considered in these works in routing planning. To resolve the shortcomings of existing models;  a receding-horizon-based strategy that can be applied to dynamic traffic networks is proposed. In this article;  various factors that the user is concerned about within the course of driving are converted into driving costs;  through which each road section of traffic networks is assigned the corresponding values. Combined with the graph theory analysis method;  the mathematical form of the dynamic traffic network is presented. Then;  the article carefully plans and adjusts EV driving routes and charging strategies. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase the adoption of EV fast charging while alleviating unreasonable distributions of regional charging demand.
