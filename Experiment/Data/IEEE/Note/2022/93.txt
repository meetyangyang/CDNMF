/i>&#x2014;A localization technology based on passive ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) is an enabling technology for intelligent warehouses;  logistics;  and retails. For this reason;  this work presents a novel method to estimate the tag location with high accuracy. A reader antenna is mounted on an autonomous mobile robot that can move in an indoor or outdoor environment due to a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The motion of the antenna generates a synthetic aperture. The system receives the phase measurements from the RFID tags and generates a distance model through phase unwrapping. In such a way;  the possible locations of the tags in the environment are generated;  creating conics. The trilateration step is performed analytically;  intersecting the obtained conics. The resulting estimations are very accurate and not computation expensive. Therefore;  the proposed approach can be employed in any application where localizing objects is fundamental even when reduced computational power is available;  e.g.;  in warehouses where the products are at known heights;  or where the items are placed on a fixed infrastructure;  such as high-shelves logistics;  to produce the inventory of the tagged objects within each shelf.
