/i>&#x2014;Business process similarity measures play an increasingly important role in business process repository management. This work addresses the role of data for process similarity measures. To this end;  three types of similarity measures;  i.e.;  data item set-based similarity;  data operation set-based similarity;  and data-aware behavior-based similarity;  are introduced to quantify the similarity of data-aware business processes from different perspectives. By comparative evaluation;  the effectiveness and applicability are demonstrated. The proposed methodology is readily applicable to enterprise process repository management problems.
