The sizing and the control of modern automated warehouse systems are carried out by using formulas thatdo not take into account that they are dynamic systems. This leadsto a big discrepancy between the expected performance and thereal performance. A model-based approach is needed to obtain accurate results. Warehouse systems have been often considered discrete event systems, while their behavior depends also on continuous time phenomena. In this paper, a new formalism is proposedto obtain a modular and compact hybrid model for these systems.A freeware simulation tool has also been developed. In the companion paper, it will be shown how this model can be used to prevent deadlocks and to evaluate the system performance.
