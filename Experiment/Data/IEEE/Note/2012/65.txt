Container retrieval is an important operation in a container port. When a ship arrives, containers stored inthe port yard are first retrieved by yard crane, loaded onto autoguided vehicles, transported to quay cranes, and loaded onto theship by quay crane. Due to various operational constraints, e.g.,maintenance of vessel balance and safety issues, the containers ina storage bay are retrieved one by one in a fixed sequence. Whenthe next container to be retrieved is not at the top of its stack, allother containers above it must then be first relocated onto otherstacks within the bay. The relocation of a container is a time-consuming operation that essentially dominates all other aspects ofthe problem, and therefore it is important that the retrieval planminimizes the number of such relocations. This study proposes amethod to generate a near-optimal retrieval plan for yard cranes.This often arises as a subproblem when devising an overall planfor port operations that maximizes throughput, which involves thecoordination of multiple pieces of machinery. Our approach produces significantly better results than all existing approaches.
