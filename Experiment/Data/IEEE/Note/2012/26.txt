Forecasting is a crucial part for many control and loading problems. Despite the fact that there is no “perfect” forecast, forecasting for highly structured data (e.g., the timeseries with high seasonality or trend) is known to be “easy” becausethere are many well-established models which provide the neededanalytical formulations. However, for many real-life control applications, the data patterns are notorious for being highly volatileand it is very difficult to analytically learn about the underliningpattern and hence the well-established statistical methods will failto make a sound prediction for them. As a result, recent advancesof artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have offered an alternative way of providing precise and more accurate forecasting result.Although AI methods can produce highly accurate forecasting results, they suffer a major drawback in which they are slow. Thisshortcoming becomes a major barricade which hinders the application of AI methods for conducting forecasting for control problems in real world. In this paper, an Intelligent Quick Prediction Algorithm (IQPA) is developed. With publicly available real datasets,we conducted computational experiments to show that the IQPA isversatile and it can finish the prediction task with accurate resultswithin a prespecified time limit.
