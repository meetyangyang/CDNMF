In single-cell microinjection, for the small size anddelicate structure of a cell, to date, most human operators have manipulated biological cells manually; therefore, low manipulation efficiency andpoor reproducibility has been reported for this task. Most manipulationsystems have primarily focused on limited visual feedback in conjunctionwith a dial-based console system, requiring extensive operator training toperform injection tasks with reproducible results. To address these problems, a telerobotic shared control method for microinjection was developed by integrating the automatic and direct manipulation functions of arobotic system. While a controller retains cells and glass pipettes within adesired path or space, the operator can concentrate on the injection task,thus achieving high throughput and dexterity.
