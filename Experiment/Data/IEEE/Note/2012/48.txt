- Task allocation into a group of heterogeneous mobile robots for implementing multiple tasks is a challenge in multirobot applications. To find and organize the most suitable coalition for each task;  we need to well organize the coalition for each task to maximize the robot group utility and optimize the task allocation solution. The sequential and holistic coalition methods presented in this paper provide both online and offline solutions for optimal multirobot task allocation. The advantage of the sequential coalition method lies in its efficiency in selecting best-fitted robots during coalition forming;  and the advantage of the holistic coalition method lies in its effectiveness in finding the global optimal solution for all tasks. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through numerous case studies with comparisons in this paper.
