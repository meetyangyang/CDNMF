The AVM system consists of a model-creation(MC) server, a VM manager, several VM clients, and many VM servers.The MC server will generate the first set of data quality evaluation models,VM conjecture models, and VM reliability evaluation models of a certaintool type. Under fab-wide VM deployment, the VM manager can fan outthe first generated set of models to all the VM servers of the same tooltype. Also, the VM server of each individual fan-out-accepter can performan automatic model refreshing process to promptly refresh its own modelset. Consequently, the VM accuracy of each VM server can be maintainedand the VM server is then ready to serve various VM applications.
