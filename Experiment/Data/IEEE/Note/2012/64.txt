As the “Age Wave” approaches, healthcare facilities are becoming relatively scarce worldwide comparedwith what are demanded. The varying availability, requirements,and preferences of both facilities and outpatients make theproblem of scheduling outpatient appointments on health carefacilities extremely challenging. Traditional manually operatedscheduling systems based on phone calls are out of date althoughthey are still widely used due to lack of new effective schedulingsystems. To solve such a problem requires an efficient Web-basedsystem to schedule the appointments instantly. The proposedapproach provides a technical foundation for efficient Web-basedscheduling systems, which can be applied directly to not onlyoutpatient scheduling in the health care sector, but also in someother real-world scheduling applications.
