This paper was motivated by the scheduling problem of a flowshop production line with sequence-dependent setup times, where jobs are processed on machines in the sameroute and a setup time is needed for each operation in a job toclean machines, prepare materials or other preparatory work. Thesetup times are determined by both the machine on which the jobis processed, and the following job. This problem widely exists inmany industries, such as the manufacturing industry. However, thescheduling problems arising from many production environments,including the considered problem, are NP-hard and extremely difficult to solve. A lot of researches have been conducted on the traditional flowshop problem in past decades, but little attention hasbeen paid to the considered one. Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have been verified to be effectivefor many scheduling problems. By comprehensively investigatingthe characteristics of GA and PSO, we proposed several adaptivehybrid algorithms. In these algorithms, each job is given an inheriting factor and an operator is constructed to update the factor dynamically, by which good and bad genes could be mined. A newcrossover is developed by both inheriting good genes to offspringand destroying bad genes with high probability. Therefore, moreand more good genes are inherited to the offspring generation bygeneration, which helps the proposals to obtain high effectiveness.We demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposedalgorithm through extensive computational experim
