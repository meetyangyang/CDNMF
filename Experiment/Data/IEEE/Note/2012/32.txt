The dynamics of many systems can be accurately described only by simulation models. Each replication isusually time-consuming to run and provides noisy performance estimations. Instead of looking for the optimal policies for such systems, a more practical goal is to improve from given base policies,which are usually available in engineering practice. The questionis how to allocate the computing budget among action candidatesso that the best action is obtained with high probability. To the authorâ€™s best knowledge, this issue has not been addressed in the literature before. Existing methods simply use equal allocation, whichdoes not utilize the limited computing budget well. This paper considers this important problem. The optimal computing budget allocation for policy improvement (OCBAPI) is developed to asymptotically maximize a lower bound of the probability of correctly selecting the best action. The procedure can also be used when thereare multiple base policies. The performance of this procedure iscompared with equal allocation and proportional-to-variance onan academic toy example and an engine maintenance policy optimization problem.
