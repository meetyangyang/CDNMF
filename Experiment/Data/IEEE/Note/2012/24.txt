This paper is motivated by the “lot-sizing”problem in manufacturing which involves the determination of theoptimal number of parts combined to form a “lot” for each of several part types differing in their processing times, raw materialsupplying rates, etc. Using better selected lot sizes decreases theaverage lead time, and ultimately leads to larger throughput. Inaddition, lot sizing provides an inexpensive way to improve performance by controlling a simple parameter, especially when compared to complicated manufacturing reengineering processes. Thispaper proposes an algorithm to calculate optimal lot sizes for multiple types of manufacturing parts. This algorithm only relies ondata that are either readily observable or easily calculated fromoperating production systems. It can be easily programmed andused for online estimation of optimal lot sizes. Further, this paperexamines the problem from the point-of-view of a central coordinator aiming to optimize a system-wide objective and can select alllot sizes or as a “game” where each part type controller can individually select its own lot size to optimize its own objective. It is shownthat both approaches lead to the same solution. This property is attractive since it indicates an inherent fairness in treating differentpart types and suggests that similar mechanisms may be used inother applications with similar resource contention features.
