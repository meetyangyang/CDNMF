Current RFID features fast identification of many physical objects. However;  the integrity check of a group of objects is usually done by looking up a packaging list or a shipment list in EDI;  which requires a network connection. Our proposed “group coding” of RFID tags can perform the group integrity check without a network connection. In addition;  when the integrity of the group is infringed;  the group coding can determine the number of RFID tags missing from the group. These features of group coding can reduce the cost of looking up shipment lists and locate missing RFID tags. The accuracy of the determination is controlled by adjusting the size of data written in each RFID tag. Adopters of group coding can select the optimal performance of group coding from the requirements of the accuracy and constraints like memory consumption of RFID tags.
