This paper is motivated by solving theparameter optimization problem of laser cutting process for touchpanel manufacturing. Empiricism or trial-and-error experimentsare the adopted strategies for tuning related cutting parametersto overcome the disqualification of touch panel cutting process.However, it requires considerable time and cost, and cannotguarantee to find good parameter settings to ensure the cuttingquality. This paper suggests a parameter optimization procedurecomposed of four stages—important parameter identification bysignificant test, experiment and data collection via design matrix,predicting model construction by neural network, and parameteroptimization using the genetic algorithm—to solve this problem.The result is quite satisfied. The proposed procedure can bereplicated easily in different application domains. Please do nothesitate to contact us if you have any question about this paper.
