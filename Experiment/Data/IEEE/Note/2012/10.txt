This work is motivated by the qualitycontrol of surfaces generated by multistage machining processes,such as the deck face on an automotive engine head. The part surface shape changes from stage to stage in a very complex mannerand can be precisely characterized by a HDM system that collectshigh density data over the surface. Therefore, the HDM providesopportunities to understand and improve surface quality controlstrategies in high-precision manufacturing. Although a significantamount of research has been carried out in studying the partdimensional changes over stages, there are limited approachesavailable to analyze complex shape changes for surface variationreduction. This paper develops a new functional morphing model to characterize the between-stage surface changes. Compared withconventional models, the functional morphing has advantagesin dealing with HDM data. The model facilitates monitoring ofintermediate stages based on end-of-line measurements to reducemeasurement costs. It also allows for an interstage compensationstrategy that introduces shape deformation upstream to compensate for the end-of-line errors. The compensation strategyin this paper uses fixture locating pins and clamping forces toreduce the global form error. In future research, other adjustmentmechanisms such as changes in cutter path and feed rate will beincorporated to remove part local distortions.
