This paper was motivated by the problem of automating the exchange of meaning associated with the data, among different software systems or information resources in product development. More specifically, it focuses on automatically determining the maps between the concepts from participating system, which is required to ensure that the final physical translation is accurate. Existing approaches either focus on one aspect of product information or a weighted sum of different aspects. However, there is no formal ground to choose a specific method. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, these approaches are unlikely to find the correct matches because of the inherent nonlinearity. We propose a framework, FEMFIT, in which multiple matching methods are automatically combined using inputs from experts obtained through an intuitive, Google search-like, interface. It is evaluated by comparing with known matching methods and FEMFIT shows better matching accuracy on the example cases. Future work focuses on extending the work to handle m:n matches.
