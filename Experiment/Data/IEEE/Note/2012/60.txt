 The sizing and the control of modern automated warehouse systems are carried out by using formulas thatdo not take into account that they are dynamic systems. This leadsto a big discrepancy between the expected performance and thereal performance. A model-based approach is needed to obtain accurate results. Warehouse systems have been often considered discrete event systems, while their behavior depends also on continuous time phenomena. In the companion paper, a new formalismhas been proposed to obtain a modular and compact hybrid modelfor these systems. A freeware simulation tool has also been developed. In this paper, it is shown how this model can be used to prevent deadlocks and to evaluate the system performance.
