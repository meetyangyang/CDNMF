 An RFID reader can interrupt the slot in whichno tags reply for a predefined time interval, resulting in an short idle slot.In this case, binary splitting is not the best choice but simple increase ofthe splitting level can yield much better performance. Since the slot sizesare usually fixed for a given system, the optimum value can be calculatedoffline without introducing extra computation complexity during the realtime identification.
