The motivation of this paper comes fromthe fact, published in several rigorous studies, that still today thereis a great deal of controllers installed in the industry offering apoor performance. In most cases, this is due to problems in thecontroller tuning and also to the influence from other loops. To improve this, a good assessment of the behavior of the control loopsis required. Usually, this is fixed with approaches that need a largecomputational burden including generally an identification task.In this paper, a new method to do this controller assessment is described. It is based on a Neuro-Fuzzy Model that process a featurevector coming from frequency functions and it has some clear advantages as: it works online without any dedicated experiment andit operates in parallel with the plant. The method works in a dynamic way with the error signals. So, the data stream is directlyintroduced in the algorithm in real time. The outputs of the assessment are: the detection of changes in the performance behavior ofthe controlled loops, and a measurement of the influence from eachloop to the other ones. As a limitation it can be noted that the sizeof the sliding windows must be adjusted according to the processcharacteristics. The software has been proved on a computer andan extension could be the implementation into commercial SCADAsystems.
