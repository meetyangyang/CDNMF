This paper addresses the real-time operational problem of dual-arm cluster tools with residency time constraints and activity time variation. A formal PN model is developed to describe the system. Then, based on the model, a two-level architecture is presented to deal with the problem. At the upper level, we have a periodic schedule generated offline such that, under deterministic task times, feasibility is guaranteed and cycle time is minimized. The real-time controller at the lower level is used to offset the task time variation. This paper presents such a real-time controller that makes the system adapt to task time variation. Hence, it is applicable to semiconductor manufacturing applications.
