Web services are an emerging area for businessprocess automation. This work presents a novel Petri net approach to mediation-aided composition of Web services. The proposed approach cangreatly alleviate state space explosion to automatically verify the composition of partially incompatible services, and significantly save the time andlabor of designers to obtain BPEL code. It consists of three phases: modeling composition of Web services, automatic verification of composition,and automatic generation of BPEL code. The prototype system has been developed based on the open source software PIPE and validated in a real-lifecase study. It is ready to be applied in industrial Web service compositionfor business automation.
