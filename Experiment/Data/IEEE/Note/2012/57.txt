In order to successfully apply the developed alignment control to any display manufacturing equipment, it is necessary towell understand the principle of the geometric template matching (GTM)as an alignment mark specific fast algorithm, the details on which can beconsulted in our preceding works (Kwon and Hwang, “Kinematics, patternrecognition, and motion control of mask-panel alignment system,” ControlEng. Practice, vol. 19, pp. 883–892, 2011). The new approach has the goalof updating the pose of an alignment mark as fast as the capturing rateof a frame grabber by utilizing pruned image data but recovering the lostresolution in terms of the Kalman filter. For example, in using a common30 fps grabber, the reduced image of 320 240 pixels is a proper choice tofinish the image processing and Kalman filtering within 30 ms under GTM.The proposed algorithm can be implemented in the current industrial display aligners by modifying the control software so that the reference inputsfor the distributed joint servos follow the error compensation trajectory inFig. 4 with the Kalman filter estimates.
