Cooperative behavior is a key issue in process automation as it enhances the execution time of a process. This contributionproposes a framework which guarantees the completion of a plan giventhat it is achievable within the set capabilities exhibited by the cooperativeagents.The proposed algorithm turns a cooperative plan expressed with logicpredicates and operators into a workflow net that is guaranteed to complete. If the cooperative plan is static during its execution, then it is achievedat a minimal cost (whether that be time, or any other measures of efficiency). Otherwise, if the cooperative agents possess sufficient perceptualor communication capabilities to assess (partially or fully) the state of thecooperation, then they are free to replan at will. This framework is applicable to any automation scenario that can be expressed in the form of predicate logic.
