This paper is motivated by the problemof reducing the energy consumption in metropolitan railway lines.Many metropolitan lines are highly automated, being driven byATO systems, and energy can be regenerated when trains arebraking. The configuration of these automatic driving equipmentscan be optimized to reduce energy consumption considering alsothe regenerative energy with no impact on the quality of transportservice offered to passengers. Thus, this paper is focused on theimprovement of automatic driving energy-efficiency.The key contributions of this paper are the proposed method forthe optimal design of the automatic train driving considering theenergy regenerated by the trains to the electrical network, and forthe accurate assessment of energy savings associated to investmentsin equipment to improve the use of regenerative energy, such asinverters in substations or energy storage devices.The proposed method is general and applicable to different operational models, type of lines, rolling stock or different automatictrain operation equipments. However, the specific energy savingscalculated in this paper correspond just to the analyzed case study,given that these results strongly depend on the topology of the electrical network, the characteristics of the driving equipment, theinterval between consecutive trains (high density or low densitytraffic), etc.
