This paper discusses the real-time scheduling problem of single-arm cluster tools with wafer residency timeconstraints and bounded activity time variation. With a Petri netmodel, schedulability is analyzed and schedulability conditions arepresented by using analytical expressions. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed to find a periodical schedule if it is schedulable.Such a schedule is optimal in terms of cycle time and can adapt tobounded activity time variation. Therefore, it is applicable to thescheduling and real-time control of cluster tools in semiconductormanufacturing plants.
