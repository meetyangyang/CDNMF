Inventory management plays an important role in the overall performance of SCNs. As higher inventorylevels lead to higher holding costs, companies in a SCN focus onreducing inventory levels. However, in today’s competitive, customer-driven market, companies have to ensure that the customerorders are satisfied immediately or at the earliest. Any failure indoing so could result in loss of goodwill and market share. Therefore, a company has to tradeoff between the amount of inventoryto be held and a desired service level. This has necessitated the development of a richer set of performance evaluation tools to aid inSCN design.This paper presents the development of a robust and generic approach for the aggregate level performance evaluation of SCNs.The model can evaluate the SCN performance given maximum inventory levels, production capacities, transit delays, and variabilityin processing times and (demand) arrival processes. The model developed can be coupled with an optimization model or used in a“what-if” mode to support key tactical design decisions related totarget inventory levels of raw material, intermediate goods, andfinished goods as well as production capacities.
