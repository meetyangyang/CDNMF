This paper addresses the scheduling problem ofdual-arm cluster tools with wafer residency time constraint and activitytime variation. Based on a PN model, schedulability conditions are presented and can be checked analytically. Then, a closed-form solution is proposed to obtain a periodical schedule if it is schedulable. Such a scheduleis optimal in terms of cycle time and can adapt to bounded activity timevariation. Thus, it is applicable to the scheduling and real-time control ofcluster tools in semiconductor plants. The presented concepts and methodscan be extended to other robotic systems such as medical testing facility.
