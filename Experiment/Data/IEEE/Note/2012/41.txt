The motivation for this work is the great interest ofcompanies on energy consumption optimization, looking for cost reductionand sustainability in manufacturing. Existing optimization methods focuson different levels of details. A high-level model would be able to optimizethe overall system. Unfortunately, due to the high computational cost, itcan hardly consider the deep level of mechanical and electrical parameters, which determine the real energy consumption. This paper presents anovel method to embed detailed energy consumption models into a scheduling optimization problem. An effective parameterization of the time variables reduces the model complexity, allowing the optimizer to reschedulethe complete sequence of operations for minimizing the total energy consumption, while keeping a fixed cycle time. The method has been integratedinto a commercial tool for robot programming. The optimization is applicable both on new and existing robotic systems, since the required modifications are limited to the operations rescheduling, and no investments onnew hardware are expected.
