The views of stakeholders in a productlifecycle may be different according to their concerns. However, they develop product models and data for a same product.The product models and data should be managed in a singleframework to validate consistency of product information. Theframework proposed in this paper enables stakeholders to definetheir product models and relate them to physical or simulatedinstances. A generic metamodel is also proposed to guide engineers in building their product models using engineer-friendlyterms. A product design scenario and user interface prototype wasimplemented for further understanding of the framework and themetamodel. If the prototype is integrated with a Computer-AidedDesign (CAD) system, it can be a powerful mechanism for semantically annotating CAD models.
