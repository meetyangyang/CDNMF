This paper was motivated by two problems from the real world: design of ordering policies in inventorycontrol, and design of node activation rules in sensor networks. Indesigning a good ordering policy or a good sensor activation rule,simple designs have various advantages in practice, e.g., easy tolearn, to implement, to operate, and to maintain. More generally,practitioners want to find a design or a set of designs which not onlyhave good performance but are also simple. Due to the complexityof the systems, simulation is a popular tool in industry to evaluatethe performance of different alternative designs before actual implementation. While the advance of new technology has dramatically increased computational power, efficiency is still a big concern. Our proposed approach intelligently controls the simulationof alternative designs, so that the simplest good enough designs canbe selected using a minimum computation cost. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed approach is very effective
