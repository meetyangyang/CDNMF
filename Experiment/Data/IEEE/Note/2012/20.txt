Conventional maintenance orders are triggeredwhen the system performance, i.e., reliability, is lower than a predetermined threshold, which is usually generated from the analysis of a population of products. However, in practice, each product from the same population or of the same type may be under different operating condition and environment, which results in different performance condition. In this paper,we provide an approach to extract dynamic maintenance threshold for continuously monitored degrading system to improve decision making for eachproduct. Compared with traditional maintenance policy using fixed maintenance threshold, the dynamic one considers individual operating environment and results in higher system availability.
