This paper is motivated by the problem ofhow to schedule a sequence of tasks within a given time-window. Inthe context of radar systems, a task may be defined as an event thatis used to search for the presence of a new target or update the position of a previously detected target. The existing literature modelseach task as having a fixed duration. Though a longer task duration is desirable since it enhances the received information about aparticular target, it also reduces the remaining time available forthe scheduling of other tasks. This tradeoff motivates the usage ofa fuzzy set model, wherein the task duration is allowed to take ona range of possible values. By using a suitable order in which taskdwell times are adjusted, the scheduling method in this paper canachieve enhanced utilization of the radar timeline.
