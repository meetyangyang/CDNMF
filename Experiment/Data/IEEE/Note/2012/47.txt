This work addresses the issue of carbon monoxide exposure on construction sites. A noninvasive blood oxygen saturation sensor;  called a pulse oximeter;  was integrated into a typical construction helmet to investigate the reliability of continuous monitoring of construction workers. The pulse oximetry sensing technology was shown to be reliable under typical construction tasks such that a worker would be alerted of impending carbon monoxide poisoning before becoming impaired. Additional work is required with more complex tasks as well as isolating the sensor from motion artifacts generated by head movement.
