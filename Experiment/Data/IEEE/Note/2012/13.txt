This paper describes the development ofan modular and reconfigurable assembly system for constructionof complex, heterogeneous 3D micro-nano systems. The emphasisis on manufacturability aspects such as yield, throughput and costin process automation. The system components include precisionrobots, micro-stages, end-effectors, and fixtures that accomplishassembly tasks in a shared workspace along with other processtools. High assembly yield is guaranteed by the application of aso-called Resolution-Repeatability-Accuracy (RRA) precision design rule. We present experimental results demonstrating how different microsystems are assembled within specified tolerance budgets, with high yield, using a systematic planning and a hybrid control structure and minimalist hardware approach.
