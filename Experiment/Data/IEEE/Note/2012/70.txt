This paper is motivated by the problemof predicting the silicon content in blast furnace hot metal, whichis an open problem for realizing blast furnace automation. Here,based on the single kernel and multiple kernel SVM, we pay specialattention to the silicon trend prediction since it can provide moredirect guideline for taking control action in the blast furnace operation. Theoretically, we have given the detailed reasons that multiplekernel SVM is superior to single kernel SVM, which can improvethe transparency of multiple kernel learning algorithm. The experimental results, not only confirm the superiority of multiple kernellearning algorithms, but also indicate that multiple kernel SVM isa kind of highly competitive data-driven modeling method for theblast furnace system and can provide reliable indication for blastfurnace operators to take control actions.
