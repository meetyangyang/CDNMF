This paper is motivated by the problems relatedto the efficient control of perishable inventories in the situation when theorder procurement delay spans multiple review periods and the stock isreplenished from multiple sources, as is the case of companies operatingon large geographical areas. Application of formal design methods leadsto the ordering rule which allows for reducing the safety stock volume andachieving a higher service level as compared to the commonly applied in logistics order-up-to policy. The proposed algorithm is quite intuitive and requires neither sophisticated optimization, nor complex tuning procedures.Index Termsâ€”Inventory control, sliding mode control.
