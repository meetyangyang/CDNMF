Manufacturing plays a significant role inachieving environmental sustainability. It is, therefore, crucial for manufacturing companies to apply innovative methodologies and tools tooptimize their manufacturing processes for energy saving towards greenmanufacturing. Although there have been various efforts devoted tosustainable solutions, most of them are at enterprise level, e.g., lifecycleassessment of products, supply chain reorganization, and design/selectionof new products or processes. While the efforts are necessary, they cannotbe used at machine or process level to effectively measure the right energyconsumption. Evaluation metrics without the needed details may leadobstacles to the success of any practical implementation. The energy modeling approach presented in this paper is expected to help manufacturingcompanies improve the sustainability of their existing machines with noextra investment.
