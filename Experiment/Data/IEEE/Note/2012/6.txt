Multiagent coordination presents a keyapproach to developing complex systems. In this approach, thebasic idea is to model a system as a network of interacting agents,and design for each agent a coordination module by which theagents can interact and communicate to manage the interdependencies arising due to system needs or limitations. In this paper, wepropose a novel approach for coordination design of distributedagents. By modeling coordinating agents as discrete-event processes, we formulate and address the problem of synthesizing foreach agent a coordination module to achieve conformance to agiven interagent constraint. Importantly, by showing that ourmultiagent coordination problem shares the same algorithmicfoundation with existing problems in the literature, we are ableto adapt existing techniques to develop a new coordination synthesis algorithm, without reinventing the wheel. The coordinationmodules synthesized by our algorithm are proven to be minimally interventive with the agentsâ€™ local plans and ensure thatcommunication among the agents is made only when necessary.Potential applications of our work can be found in domains wherediscrete-event modeling has proven to be suitable and effective,and these include manufacturing, transportation, and logisticssystems.
