Most of the existing academic literatureassumes that, in the case of inventory shortage, demand is alwayseither backordered or rejected (or fulfilled through some othermeans at a higher cost). This implicitly assumes that either all customers are patient and willing to wait for their orders until theyare fulfilled or all customers are impatient and walk away if theirorders are not immediately fulfilled. However, in practice, thereare many settings where both types of customers are present. Thepresence of both types of customers makes the management of suchsystems more difficult since it requires setting priorities on how inventory should be allocated and how this allocation should affectproduction decisions. In fact, very little is known about optimalcontrol policies or even effective heuristics for such systems. Inthis paper, we provide insights into the optimal policy for production and inventory allocation. We show that the optimal policy canbe complex and with counter-intuitive features. As an alternativeto the optimal policy, we provide a simple and easy to implementheuristic that performs nearly as well.
