This study is in the scope of DES, whose behaviorsare defined by sequences of events. DES may be representations of multimodes continuous systems, where we are interested by the sequences ofmodes, and not by the continuous behavior in each mode. For example,during a flight, an aircraft goes through a sequence of flight modes, suchas heading, altitude changes, and speed changes. DES may also be artificialsystems whose dynamics is intrinsically defined by sequences of events. Forexample, a telecommunication system where “receive a message” and “senda message” are examples of events. DES are encountered in several areas,such as: avionics, air traffic, road traffic, wireless sensor networks, webservices, communications protocols. In the design of DES, we are usuallyconfronted with the risk that a DES violates required properties; such violation will be referred to as fault. In this paper, we study prognosis, whichconsists in predicting faults. The interest of prognosis is that we are informed of a fault before its occurrence, and hence we can react to avoidthe fault or at least reduce its effects. In this paper, we study decentralizedprognosis, where several so-called local prognosers cooperate to make aneffective prediction. A justification of using decentralized prognosis is thatconcrete DES are usually decentralized by the fact that they consist of several modules. Another reason is that the decentralized approach can helpincrease the clarity and reduce the complexity of the prognosis system. Thepresented study is promising, but prognosis of DES is quite new and necessitates more developments before being commonly used in industry
