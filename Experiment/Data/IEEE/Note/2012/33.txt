The modular and hierarchical supervisory control problems are studied for a class of complex andlarge-scale event-driven systems, that inherits state and eventuncertainties. Examples of such systems include robotic systems, determining treatment regimens in drug delivery, chemicalprocess automations, etc. Since, the information receives fromthese systems is subjected to uncertainties and noise, the crispdiscrete modeling fails to perform well. Therefore, FDES, whichincorporate fuzzy logics with Discrete-Event Systems (DES), isconsidered.
