As cooperative multicamera surveillancenetworks become more and more popular, the demand of multicamera information fusion and user-friendly representations becomes crucial. Motivated by the demand, this paper demonstratesa new system to efficiently integrate, summarize, and infer videomessages from multiple client cameras. The ultimate goal is to provide a global view of the surveillance zone so that the managersin the control room may monitor the scene in an easier way. Themain functions of the proposed system include the fusion of detection results from many client cameras, the summarization of consistent messages, and the inference of the target movement in the3-D scene. In the near future, we will also take into considerationmore information, like temporal clues, photometric clues, and object-level clues, in order to perform advanced scene analyses likeabnormal behavior detection.
