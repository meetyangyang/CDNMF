Mobile robotic hubs can provide connectivity service in applications such as disaster response where the underlying communication infrastructure is broken. In such applications, often a communication bridge between two sites (e.g., a command center and a specificsite) must be established. In such scenarios, robots can autonomously deploy themselves and create a communication bridge.In this work, we study the efficient use of mobile robots to create a communication bridge between a source and a destination . This yields achallenging resource allocation problem in which mobility and communication constraints must be addressed simultaneously. Specifically, we studythe following problem: Given and , and the initial locations of the mobilehubs, find their final locations so as to minimize the number of hubs used inthe bridge and (either maximum or total) distance traveled by the hubs. Wepresent efficient, provably correct approximation algorithms for a specialversion of this optimization problem in which the hubs are required to moveonto the line segment  . From a practical perspective, this special caseis important because on the open plane it minimizes the overall numberof hubs on the bridge. Thus, our algorithms can be used in scenarios suchas robots operating in open spaces (land, water, or air). From a theoreticalperspective, it provides an important first step toward the solution of thegeneral problem where the hubs can be placed at arbitrary locations
