Complex logic controllers are sometimeswritten assuming that inputs will occur in a specific order. If theinput order is switched due to network or processing delay, thenthe logic control may respond in an unexpected fashion. If the logiccontrol’s response depends on the order in which the inputs occurfor inputs whose order should not matter, then improper behaviormay result—occasionally—and thus be very difficult to diagnoseand debug. The verification procedure provided in this paper enables system designers to find design issues in the control logic associated with inputs occurring in different orders so that these issues may be remedied before they cause improper behavior anddowntime. Since the verification procedure uses simulations of thesystem, the time required for such simulations will depend on thesystem’s size. This verification procedure was motivated by thecontrol of manufacturing systems, but it also can be applied toother types of systems with distributed or networked controllers
