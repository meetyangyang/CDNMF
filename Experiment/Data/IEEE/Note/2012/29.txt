 This paper proposes methods and algorithms for a new sequence planning approach in which sequencesare automatically created based on the relations among operationsinstead of having to be manually constructed. Using various views,the sequences of operations related to, for example, part flow, robotoperations, and operator tasks, can be visualized. The use of various views helps the user better understand the relations betweencell control and mechanical design, and between product designand total system behavior.
