Production scheduling tools are one of thekeys in flexible manufacturing systems to improve its performance.These tools are usually based on optimization methods, as couldbe the Lagrangian Relaxation. The problems of using optimization methods are the need of time to get the solution, and the needof a high-specialized user to tune them. Therefore, optimizationmethods must be improved to use less time to obtain solutions andto do not need high-specialized users. This paper was motivated bythese needs: reducing the CPU time when scheduling operationsin production planning to permit quick replies to real-time perturbations into production processes; and making easier the use ofproduction scheduling tools. This paper suggests new approachesfor the Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) method applying ConstraintLogic Programming (CLP) and improving the multipliers calculation (inside the Subgradient method) during the iterations to speedup the convergence of the LR method and make it easily tuned.Thus, the CPU time to find a solution is reduced and the resultsshow that the use of the approaches reduces the needed knowledge(about the LR method application) to correctly tune the parameters to obtain good solutions. Therefore, an industry would be ableto react to perturbations in less time and without a high-specialized user.
