A traditional automated manufacturingline is typically designed to produce a single specific product inlarge volume. Currently, the changing tastes of customers stimulate manufacturing enterprises to flexibly produce a variety ofproducts without large volumes. Hence, a recent research trendin Japan called the cellular manufacturing system (a human-centered flexible assembly system) was proposed. To improve the assembly efficiency of the cellular manufacturing system, especially in an environment where there are fewer operators in an agingsociety, this paper proposed a human-robot collaboration systemto take advantages of both human operators and robots. In thiscollaboration, system robots are used to assist operators duringthe assembly process, and the assembly information is provided toguide operators according to their cognition characteristics. Theapplications range from production control, human-robot collaboration, assembly information guidance systems, and safe design toprotect the operators from being hurt by the robots. Besides providing passive supports to the operators, this paper also introducesan assembly skill transfer system to improve novice operatorsâ€™ assembly skills, and applied it in the actual cellular manufacturingsystem.
