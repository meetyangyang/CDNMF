The usage of formal methods is widelyadvocated to provide evidence of critical properties of systemsfor certification and/or assessment purposes. This paper wasmotivated by the problem of (partially) automating the development and the analysis of complex formal models of real systems.Existing approaches generally require that whoever builds suchmodels has an in-depth knowledge of several fields, besides thedomain to study: modeling languages (e.g., Petri Nets, Fault Trees,Process Algebras, Queueing Networks, Bayesian Networks), solution techniques, analysis/simulation tools, as well as the way tocombine them in order to perform more powerful experiments.In this paper, we propose a workflow-based solution, in order toenable the automated development and analysis of multiformalismmodels by composing predefined models and existing tools. Ourapproach also promotes the reuse of models and experiments,through the construction of libraries of models and workflows andthe definition of sophisticated experiments.
