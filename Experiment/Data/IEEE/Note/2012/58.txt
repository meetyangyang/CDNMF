The increasing complexity of the real-world industry processes inevitably leads to the occurrence of nonlinearity and highdimensions, and their mathematical models are often difficult to build. Howto design the optimal controller for nonlinear systems without the requirement of knowing the explicit model has become one of the main foci of control practitioners. However, this problem cannot be handled by only relying on the traditional dynamic programming technique because of the"curse of dimensionality". To make things worse, the backward directionof solving process of dynamic programming precludes its wide applicationin practice. Therefore, in this paper, the iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to deal with the optimal control problemfor a class of unknown nonlinear systems forward-in-time. Moreover, thedetailed implementation of the iterative ADP algorithm through the globalized dual heuristic programming technique is also presented by usingneural networks. Finally, the effectiveness of the control strategy is illustrated via simulation study.
