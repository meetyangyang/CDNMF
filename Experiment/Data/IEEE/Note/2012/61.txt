Manipulation of biological andbiomimetic objects are revolutionizing the health care and communication industry, and achieving fundamental scientific breakthroughs. For example, cell sorting in optical tweezers-assistedfluidic chambers is aiding tumor immunology and chemotherapy,multicellular arrangements are being used to study intercellsignaling, drug transport and binding, and artificial biomimeticmachines like rotary DNA actuators and viral linear rotary motors are being assembled to form electronic switches. This paperprovides a step toward automating such manipulation operationsby developing an intelligent planning framework that is geared forthe unique characteristics of the microscopic environment and iscapable of transporting specific particles to desired goal locationsconcurrently, which can then be used as handles to push, orient,or deform the objects of interest.
