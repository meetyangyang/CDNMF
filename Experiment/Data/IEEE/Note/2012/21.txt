The number of potentially preventablehospital deaths in the U.S. is astonishingly high. This prompts anationwide initiative to develop and implement rapid response systems to evaluate, triage, and treat patients with clinical signs ofdeterioration in order to reduce the frequency and severity of negative outcomes. Developing an analytical model of the acute caredelivery process, and using it to improve the efficacy of rapid response operations and patient safety are the key elements to ensure success. The method introduced here will enable us to evaluatethe performance of rapid response process, investigate system-theoretic properties, and identify the bottleneck response that impedessystem performance in the strongest manner, and discover routesfor continuous improvement. Such a method is helpful to uncoverthe fundamental principles governing acute care delivery processesand utilize them to improve the efficiency of healthcare operationsand patient safety.
