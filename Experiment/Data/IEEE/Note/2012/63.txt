Effective building evacuation in case ofemergencies, such as fire and smoke, has long been recognized asan important issue. Effective crowd guidance can improve evacueesâ€™ survivability and egress efficiency. In practice, most guidance(e.g., an exit sign) directs evacuees to the nearest exits. As crowdsmove and fire spreads over time, however, such guidance is questionable because some exits may be overcrowded or obstructed by fire and smoke. This paper establishes a new network-flow model,where crowd evacuation behaviors are supported by psychologicalfindings and simulation studies. Novel optimization techniques arethen used to find egress routes for effective evacuation. Numericalresults show that our solution will update guidance when the emergency situation significantly changes. Compared with using nearestexits, our solution can help evacuate people more efficiently.
