Traditionally, in the manufacturing systemdevelopment process, once the design is completed, a simulationmodel is built for design validation. Then, the actual system is built.The confidence of the simulation is limited by the accuracy of thesimulation model, and testing of the actual system can be time-consuming with high safety risks, such as personal injury and damages to equipment. To accommodate product changes and revisions, there is an ongoing continuous improvement process on theplant floor, such as reconfiguration of manufacturing system equipment, and adding hardware and software into existing processes.This may result in loss of production due to a long validation periodwith possibilities of damaged equipment. With the HPS approachoutlined in this paper, however, the simulated and actual components can be validated and tested iteratively; this means each component can be tested with more individual focus, without having towait until the entire process is complete. In the case of modifyingan existing system, simulations can be seamlessly integrated withthe real process to evaluate different solutions before a particularoption is financially committed. Because the actual components areused during the simulation phase, the overall validation accuracyis less dependent on a single simulation model, while the testingscope is significantly expanded.
