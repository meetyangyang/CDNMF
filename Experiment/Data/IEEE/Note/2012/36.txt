This paper is motivated by the issue ofinsufficient PLC performance in an airport baggage handlingsystem. When trying to deploy distributed control to PLC basedbaggage handling systems and provide intelligence to each PLCfor sorting bags and malfunction detection, the efficiency andperformance problems occur. Also, the PLC is not capable of reconfiguring the program during the operation. The performanceof data update on a fieldbus deteriorates when more PLCs areconnected to it.This paper suggests to use IEC 61499 standard and distributedcontrol to solve those problems and proposes a way to migrate toIEC 61499 from IEC 61131-3 PLCs. By applying the proposed object-oriented and class-oriented design patterns for combining IEC61499 with IEC 61131-3, the migration of centrally controlled baggage handling systems to distributed control systems is feasible. Inthis paper, we present a general translation methodology for bothobject-oriented and class-oriented approaches. Also, the data handling efficiency over the distributed control system network is investigated and suggestions are made for minimize the processingtime for data handling. The real airport baggage handling systemexample is used for illustration of our migration method. The limitations of both approaches are provided and recommendations forhow to apply each approach are also given. In the future work, wewill focus on the negotiation between distributed notes and runtimereconfiguration for distributed notes by applying the IEC 61499standard.
