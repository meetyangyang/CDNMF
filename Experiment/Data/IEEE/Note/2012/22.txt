SCE by microcapillary is an efficientmethod to insert molecules into single cells for human healthresearch. Before SCE can occur, placement of a microcapillary tipon a cell membrane is required. The same electrical infrastructureused for SCE is also used to detect tip-membrane contact bysensing changes in current through an electrode in the microcapillary. An abrupt decrease in current occurs during tip-membranecontact and throughout membrane indentation. By measuringthis current there is no need for additional proximity sensors.In previous works, the objective was to indent the membranesufficiently beyond the initial contact decreasing the current toa predetermined thresholdâ€”indicating the conditions requiredfor SCE to occur. However, thin, adhered cells pose a challengefor automated tip-placement where the distance from the initial tip-membrane contact to the glass substrate is small. This limitsthe amount of cell indentation possible before damage to the celland microcapillary tip occurs. In addition, the inherent noiseof electrode-based systems and physical variations in thin cells,reduce the repeatability for specifying a predetermined thresholdduring tip-placement sequence. This work describes a systemto achieve fully automated, tip-membrane contact detection ofthin cells using the double-sided cumulative sum as a precursorto SCE. Little, if any, parameter modification is required forgeneral-purpose use and this real-time, recursive algorithm canbe implemented on microcontroller-based systems. This methodcould be extended to other electrode-based applications thatare not facilitated by a microcapillary (e.g., lab-on-a-chip, microfluidic, or MEMS applications), where cell contact detection isrequired in the presence of a low signal-to-noise ratio.
