Automated Container Terminal (ACT)is a popular topic among port operators. Industrial practitionershave proposed various alternative ACT designs. One of the newdesigns we observed in China utilizes frame bridges and railmounted trolleys to transport containers between quay side andyard side. In this design, containers are first transported fromvessels to frame trolleys mounted on frame bridges using normalquay cranes; then, by using a new machine which can lift acontainer and rotate it by 90 , the containers are moved from theframe trolleys to ground trolleys (GTs) at the ground level. Usingthe GTs, the containers are delivered to yard cranes near theirallocated storage locations. This study explores this new ACTdesign concept, and could help port operators who are interestedin building new automated terminals, to better understand the relative merits of this new design and decide whether it is applicablein their terminals.
