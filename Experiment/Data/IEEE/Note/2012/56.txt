In automation, the eventual purpose of sensing isfor assembly and other operations. Recognition by touch has several advantages: efficiency, robustness to disturbance, and immunity to occlusion(unlike a vision system). We demonstrate that 3D objects can be recognizedwith small amounts of data acquired via robot touch. In particular, recognition can be as simple as dragging one or more fingers across a part of anobject's surface.
