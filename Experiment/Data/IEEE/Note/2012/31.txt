Engineering Changes (ECs) are commonwithin a manufacturing enterprise. Detailed evaluation of a proposed EC or its effect is a time-consuming process. Therefore, enterprises plan detailed evaluation of only those effects that mighthave a significant cost impact. Since similar ECs are likely to havesimilar impacts, past EC knowledge can be used for determiningwhether the proposed EC effect has significant impact. Utilizingpast EC knowledge to predict the impact of a proposed EC effectwill, however, require an approach to compute similarity betweenECs. The motivation of this paper is to address this requirement.The data about an EC is captured using a set of attributes thatare of disparate types. This paper presents measures to computesimilarity between two values of an attribute. The measures aredefined such that the similarity is computed using the knowledgecaptured in the database of past ECs as well as the domain-specificsemantics. The similarities between attribute values are aggregatedto compute similarity between ECs. We present a detailed evaluation of our approach against relevant state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that our approach performs significantly betterthan other approaches.The approach discussed in this paper can be applied to problems in other areas, e.g., bioinformatics or text categorization,which require computing similarity between a new object andthe past objects with a goal of ultimately using the similarityvalues for classifying new object. Our approach for computingattribute values similarity can be applied to other problems, e.g.,feature-based shape similarity assessments, in the area of productdevelopment which require similarity computation between twovalues of a product feature.The scope of our approach is restricted to ECs made to a singlemechanical part that has prismatic shape. Considering assemblieswould require an additional module to determine correspondenceamong the parts.
