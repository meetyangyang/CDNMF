This paper was motivated by the problem ofstitching carbon fiber mats with an autonomously guided robot to realizethe production of carbon fiber mats in lot-size one. Existing approaches usemanually programmed robots, which following the seam of the materialdraped of preforms. This is time consuming and not suited for a production of many different parts at very low numbers. For the applicationcontinuous edge tracking and real-time performance must be guaranteedto obtain a continuous stitching process.
