This work proposes a computationalframework that simultaneously considers the ecological influencesof manufacturing, assembly, and the supply chain in the systemdesign stage. A CAD-based variation mechanism of product architecture automatically generates manufacturing bills of materials(BOMs) that fulfill product functional requirements and satisfythe assembly constraints. Integrated with lifecycle assessment,optimization schemes are applied to guide the variation processand search for optimal BOMs with reduced carbon footprint. Theproposed framework serves as a quantitative tool of ecologicaldecision making for product design.
