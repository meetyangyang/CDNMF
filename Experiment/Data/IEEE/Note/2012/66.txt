Identifying the influential patents manually by experts requires much time and efforts. Centralitymeasures in citation network have the advantage of providing thesupport for filtering such influential patents using an automatedprocess. However, existing centrality techniques commonly sufferfrom the computational burden of the network with large nodes.To avoid this problem, this paper introduces a singular value basedcentrality which can be applied even to the case of the networkwith extremely large nodes. Especially, the new row updatingand downdating techniques are proposed to obtain the singularvalues efficiently from a node similarity matrix of a large network. Our proposed approach makes it possible to find influential andimportant nodes efficiently in any large networks.
