More reliable and sensitive skin of robothands is realized by shape-sensing of objects in contact. Withthe shape-sensing, we can achieve a stable grip of robot handsavoiding protruding portion, and obtain reliable grip positions.With shape-deformation of flexible objects, we can avoid thegrasped object (with robot fingers) by controlling the graspingforce. Although various types of tactile sensors for robot handshave been developed, there have been few sensors that shape-senseof objects in contact. This paper suggests a three-dimensionalshape-sensing method of object in contact. The sensor can becompact in size and structure, since we use only a single camera.Although we used many parameters, the proposed method allowsthe practitioners to implement the proposed method in an easymanner to their applications. We should evaluate how efficient theproposed method is for various applications. Future work includesimplementation to the robot hands.
