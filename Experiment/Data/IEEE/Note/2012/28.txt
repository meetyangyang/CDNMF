Alarm systems are critically importantto the safety and efficient operation of modern industrial plants,whose operations are monitored by continuous measurements ofvarious signals. However, industrial surveys have shown that operators of industrial plants receive far more alarms, many of whichbelong to nuisance alarms, than they can handle. Relieving thisproblem is based upon a satisfactory performance of the alarmsystem for each univariate signal involved in the operation of industrial plants. This paper studies the performance assessment anddesign of univariate alarm systems for basic mechanism of alarmgeneration and for advanced one exploiting alarm on/off delays.The obtained results are applicable to various industrial plants including power, chemical, and petrochemical plants.
