 With the purpose to fulfill the tasks wherepositioning and manipulating with micro or nanoscale precisionare required, such as positioning of the samples in a microscopeand microassembly of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS),a decoupled compliant XY stage with good stiffness performanceshould be designed. The dimensions of the stage are optimized toobtain high natural frequencies. FEA is carried out to confirm thereliability of the structure. The stage is fabricated with aluminumalloy AL7075-T6 using wire electric discharge machining (WEDM)technique. Owing to the kinematic decoupling structure, singleinput-single-output (SISO) control strategies can be applied. Thestage has the capability to achieve a larger workspace when drivenby piezoelectric actuators (PZT) with higher displacement output.Its accuracy can be further improved by using actuators and sensors with higher resolution, therefore potential applications will bevery wide.
