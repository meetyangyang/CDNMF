In view of the requirements of both largeworkspace and rapid response for micro-/nanomanipuolation, anew dual-stage nanopositioning system is presented in this paper.It is composed of flexure-based compliant mechanisms and drivenby coarse and fine actuators. The mechanism design has direct relation to automation of the nanopositioning system. Due to the interaction of the coarse and fine actuation, the implementation of SISOcontrol scheme necessitates a proper structure design. This paperpresents the design of a dual-stage to decouple the coarse and fineactuation in order to facilitate SISO control. The performed simulation and experimental studies validate the proposed design ideas.Thus, the automated dual-stage system can be controlled by anySISO controller. For illustration, popular PID control is adoptedfor both VCM and PSA stages. Experimental results demonstratethe merits of a dual-stage over the standalone coarse stage in termsof transient response speed as well as steady-state accuracy. Moreadvanced SISO control strategies can be employed to realize theautomation of the dual-stage nanopositioning system as well.
