This paper addresses a real-life crude oiltransportation planning problem with direct delivery. Based onmathematical properties, the problem is transformed into a lotsizing problem with limited production and inventory capacity.This latter problem is shown to be exactly solvable in polynomialtime with dynamic programming. In other words, an optimal solution of this problem can be obtained within a very short amountof computation time, even for large sized instances. Furthermore,the algorithm can be easily implemented with Excel tables and acase study with real-life data shows that the proposed algorithmyields a solution reducing very significantly (by more than 25%)the transportation cost, compared with the classical solution withimmediate deliveries.
