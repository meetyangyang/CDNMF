Fabrication of nanoscale devices byAFM-based manipulation has attracted much attention recently.However, it is a sequential approach and therefore the throughputis low. To increase the efficiency of AFM-based nanomanipulation, automation is considered to be the ultimate solution.Unfortunately, automation in AFM-based nanomanipulation isfacing several technical hurdles. The thermal drift is one of them.Because of the presence of thermal expansion and contraction,the relative position between the tip and the sample undergoesdrift with respect to time. Therefore, the AFM images are oftendistorted due to the thermal drift because the time taken toacquire a complete AFM image is in the range of minutes. Thispaper tries to tackle this problem by compensating the thermaldrift through direct measurement of the thermal drift by localscan. The direct measurement not only can be used to correct the drift-induced distortion in the initial AFM image, it can alsobe used to compensate the real-time drift during manipulation.Starting from a drift-clean image at the beginning and withdrift being compensated in real-time during manipulation, theAFM-based nanomanipulation can be more accurate and efficient.The research results here is one of the important steps to achievefull automation in AFM-based nanomanipulation.
