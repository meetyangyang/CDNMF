This paper deals with the uncertaintymanagement problem of product disassembly. To do so, this workproposes a novel probability analysis method of disassembly costsubject to random removal time and different removal labor cost.Previously, such a problem is handled through a methodologybased on probabilistic planning and expected value analysis,which is ineffective without considering the probability problemof completing a disassembly task. The goal of this work is topropose some probability evaluation models for disassembly costwith different constraints. Both theoretical and simulation resultsdemonstrate that the proposed approach can perform effectivelythe quantitative analysis of a disassembly process. Such resultscan be used to guide disassembly decision makers in making rightdisassembly decisions.
