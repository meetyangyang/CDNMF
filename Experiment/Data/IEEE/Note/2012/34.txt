Data streaming has become an important paradigm in many business and scientific applications, suchas fraud detection in banking industry and gravitational-waveobservation in astronomy. In this paper, we apply virtualizationto provide better support for these applications, leveraging itsadvantage in resource on-demand allocation. A novel dynamiccontrol method is proposed so that CPU and bandwidth can beco-scheduled and co-allocated since for data streaming applications these resources are tightly coupled from the performanceperspective. In this control method, fuzzy logic control is appliedfor CPU allocation and an iterative algorithm is adopted forprocessing-, congestion-, and storage-aware bandwidth allocation.We use fuzzy control because it does not rely on the mathematicalmodeling of an object and can implement human expertsâ€™ heuristicknowledge via IF-THEN rules. Therefore, it is desirable in ourdata streaming scenario, due to the variable coupling and heavilynonlinear nature of the system.
