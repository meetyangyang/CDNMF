This paper is motivated by the need ofproviding novel AFM probe tips for critical dimension metrologyin nanooptical and nanoelectronic applications. In this area, theanalysis of high-aspect ratio and sidewall structures is one of themost crucial challenges in improving and optimizing the currentfeature size and performance. For this purpose, this paper presentsa nanorobotic system and strategy facilitating the assembly andprocessing of CNT-enhanced AFM probes. While the assemblyprocess has already been shown to be fully automated, this paperfocuses on postprocessing techniques for the assembled CNT tipsby FIB-milling in order to adapt them to the specific application.The results clearly show a high reproducibility of the FIB processing so that future work will concentrate on automating thisprocess as well to increase the possible fabrication throughput.
