It often takes much time and effort toimplement algorithms and functions involved with the robot SWapplications. In addition, developers of robot SW applicationsshould have a good knowledge on a variety of areas and be familiarwith different kinds of development environments and platforms,which may impose a heavy burden on them and prevent themfrom concentrating on their special jobs. In this paper, we proposean OPRoS that covers from the control of HW devices to theexecution of complicated application programs. In order to offer acomprehensive development environment with extensive functionsand hence accommodate the increasing demand for developing avariety robot SW applications, the OPRoS has an all-level toolsand features. For those who want to apply the OPRoS to theirrobots and furthermore extend it, all sources and executable filesas well as documents are available
