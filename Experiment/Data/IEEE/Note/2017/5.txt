This paper is motivated by the problemof allowing robots to autonomously accompany humans in searchand-rescue situations for providing assistance. For example, companion robots can carry heavy loads and follow human rescuerswho want to search for survivors. Two types of requirementsneed to be taken into account for companion robots to achievethe so-called socially desirable companion behavior: first, thesafety requirement requires robots strictly keep a safe distancefrom humans to avoid colliding and hurting people; second, itis desirable for robots to stay within a “comfort zone” aroundthe human, and also maintain a similar speed to make humanfeel comfortable. This is referred as the comfort requirement.In order to generate socially desirable companion behavior, wespecifically tackle two challenges in this paper: human motionprediction and robot motion planning. We propose an online prediction approach that simultaneously considers multiple typicalhuman motion models to reflect natural movements of humans.In addition, we design a model mismatch estimator to compensatefor the errors arising from the model uncertainty. Based onthe predicted human motion, we use an optimal control-basedapproach to compute robot trajectories that satisfy the safetyand comfort requirements. Ten randomly selected scenarios areused to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Theresults show superior performance in terms of the accuracy and response time in the estimation and prediction using theproposed approach. Moreover, the motion planner successfullyensures socially desirable companion behavior. In the futurework, we will investigate different learning-based approaches toestimate human motion in real time.
