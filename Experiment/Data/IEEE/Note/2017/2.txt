This paper was motivated by the viability of using fixed-wing UAS to execute persistent surveillance,search-and-rescue missions, and related security applications. Atpresent, these UAS are not very maneuverable in comparisonwith their piloted counterparts. Rotary-wing platforms lack theendurance required. Minimum turning radius can significantlyaffect path feasibility and efficiency if turns cannot be executed within the sensor footprint. The problem is sufficientlycomplex that optimal solutions are computationally impractical.Current state-of-the-art planners typically avoid turning radius constraints or limit coverage to probabilistic solutions to reducecomputational complexity. In this paper, we develop an approachthat yields feasible paths to provide persistent area coverage whilemaintaining sensor/imaging resolution to user specifications. Thepaths are not provably optimal, but are efficient and guaranteecoverage. Solutions are readily integrated with typical autopilotflight plan specifications. Experimental results in simulation usingtypical UAS flight dynamics provide promising results. Moreover,portions of our approach have been successfully demonstrated inflight test. In ongoing research, we are enhancing the approach, sothat it can accommodate obstacles and nonuniform search areas.
