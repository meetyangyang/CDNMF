In some manufacturing processes, the spatial distribution of “points,” such as defects, dead pixels, and particles, is often highly related with final product quality. It is often beneficial to analyze the point distribution pattern to monitor the processes and identify potential process variations. In the current practice, experience-based and error-prone visual inspection is still common, particularly in new processes such as fabrication of nanoparticle-reinforced materials. This work aims to automate this monitoring process by developing a highly effective algorithm for assessing the uniformity of point distributions, based on rigorous statistical properties from spatial point distribution theories. Our simulation results show the proposed method is much more efficient than some typical existing methods in detecting nonrandomness of the point pattern. To implement this method, locations of all points need to be known and extracted by pre-processing the inspection data which are often grayscale images.
