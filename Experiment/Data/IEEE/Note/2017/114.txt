In this paper, bacterial foraging algorithm is used as an optimization technique to optimize the Gaussian support vector classifier machine parameters in the fatigue classification of electromyography (EMG) signals. To recognize the fatigue status of each EMG signal, a threestep methodology was developed for EMG signal classification. In the first step, the EMG signals are decomposed into different frequency bands by ensemble empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform. In the second step, the statistical features extracted from these bands are decomposed into EMG signals to achieve better accuracy for the diagnosis of muscular fatigue. In the last step, an unknown part of the EMG signal is classified as normal, and fatigue is defined by different classification methods.
