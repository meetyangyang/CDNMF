To addresses the challenges from theprospective of service selection in mobile environment to reduceenergy consumption, this paper constructs an energy consumptioncomputation model for mobile devices and formalizes serviceselection for composition as an optimization problem. In order tosolve the NP-hard problem, it adopts the genetic algorithm andconducts a serial of experiments to show the effectiveness andefficiency of the solution. The proposed solution can help usersto select the proper services with the least energy consumptionin mobile environment. It can be implemented and deployed as acloud service to recommend services for mobile users.
