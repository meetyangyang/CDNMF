Automated modeling of controlleddiscrete manufacturing systems can be achieved by efficientidentification algorithms that cope with large and complex plantsperforming concurrent and repetitive tasks a priori unknown.The black-box identification procedure processes an input/outputsequence recorded during the system functioning for a long periodof time, and then yields a comprehensive model of the closed-loopcontrolled system; this model approximates closely the actualbehavior of the compound system controller-plant. A tool basedon identification algorithms constitutes an excellent resource forcomputer-aided reverse engineering of controlled manufacturingsystems. The method proposed herein allows processing sequencescomposed by thousands of I/O vectors in a few seconds.
