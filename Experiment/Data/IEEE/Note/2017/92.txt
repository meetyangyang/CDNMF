In many practical applications, the system would perform a given task cycle by cycle. There are also many industrial processes operating periodically. In a word, repeatability is inherent in these systems. Then, it would lead to constant improvements to the system performance, just as we are able to learn from experiences and subsequently improve our behaviors in daily lives. This is exactly the control idea in this paper. On the other hand, learning, by trials and errors, allows us to make modifications and corrections on the actions. This is why the algorithm proposed in this paper could achieve accurate tracking without system information. To be specific, the algorithm updates differently during the odd cycles and the even cycles. For the odd cycle, the control is added with a small perturbation, while for the subsequent even cycle, the control is updated by estimating the gradient with the help of trial information. The detailed algorithm steps are provided with strict analysis on the convergence and optimality properties.
