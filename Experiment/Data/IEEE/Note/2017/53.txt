High-speed piezo-actuated nanopositioning stages are playing an increasingly important role inthe fields of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs). However, thetracking speed and accuracy of the nanopositioning stages arehindered by the hysteresis and dynamics behaviors of the piezo-actuated systems. In this work, a MRC-based approach is developed,which is tailored for the lateral scanning process of SPMs. TheMRC can directly mitigate the hysteresis by decomposing it asa periodic disturbance, which releases the burden of hysteresismodel construction. Besides, the MRC has a better nonperiodicdisturbance rejection capability than the conventional repetitive control. Experimental results demonstrate the merits ofthe MRC-based approach in terms of hysteresis compensation,disturbance rejection, and tracking accuracy. Due to a simplestructure and ease of implementation, the developed MRC-basedapproach can be applied to other piezo-actuated nanopositioningsystems involving with the hysteresis.
