At present, the shape deviation of the product hinders the application of additive manufacturing in extensive industries. This paper propose an in-plane compensation plan for a fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. Mathematical models are built to predict the deviation of a 2-D shape, and a compensation algorithm is derived based on this model. With the methodology described in this paper, a special compensation system can be developed for an FDM machine. This system analyzes the measurement of specifically designed test products, derives a compensation plan, and modifies any 2-D computer-aided design model to increase the shape fidelity of the product.
