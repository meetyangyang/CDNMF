Renewable energy sources (wind, solar,biomass, hydro, etc.) have an exponentially growing relevancewithin the power delivery infrastructures. However, due to theirintrinsically stochastic behavior, they are difficult to manage andcontrol. In addition, the grid will be more and more characterizedby distributed generation, bidirectional power flows, and demandresponse (DR) strategies. In this framework, it is necessary tocontrol in real time the grid and to limit the difficulty of thetasks of the distribution system operator (DSO). However, a wellestablished reference framework is still absent as regards themodeling of the interaction among DSO and microgrids, withinthe objective of defining effective DR strategies. In this paper, atwo-level control scheme is proposed, which is capable of takinginto account the “local” objectives (i.e., the objectives of the various microgrids) and the exigency of coordination among the various microgrids, as regards their interaction with the main grid.
