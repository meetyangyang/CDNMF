As the practical engineering systems are becoming more and more complex, it is more likely to suffer from faults which can lead to unpredictable behaviors and serious damages. Therefore, adaptive fault tolerant control technique plays an important role in modern engineering systems. As a matter of fact, it is always desired to minimize the maintenance cost even when some faults occur in the systems, which can reduce the energy consumption in the industrial production process. One way is to integrate the adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm into the fault tolerant controller. Furthermore, a major restriction of the learning algorithm is that a large number of parameters should be tuned online, which directly increase the computational burden. In order to tackle this difficulty, by adjusting the estimated values of the network weight vectors instead of their weights, the number of adaptive learning parameters is decreased, and the computational burden is reduced dramatically.
