This paper was motivated by the problem of rolling stock rostering in Taiwan High Speed Rail System. The rolling stock rostering needs to take several practical factors into consideration such as maintenance requirements, depot maintenance capacity, connections among duties for successive days, and daily train-set availability. The manual process for rolling stock rostering is time-consuming and tedious, and the quality of the results can be improved. In this study, we proposed a heuristic method which consists of five phases to allot train-sets to duties automatically. The idea of assigning train-sets to duties is to keep the cumulative mileage of each train-set close to a corresponding ideal cumulative mileage. The cumulative mileages of all train-sets can evenly approach to the upper limitation of maintenance mileage so that the utilization of train-sets can be raised. The automation process can also provide prompt response to incidents during daily operation. Using this decision support tool will help railways with similar characteristics maximize their return from rolling stock investment and provide reliable service to their customers.
