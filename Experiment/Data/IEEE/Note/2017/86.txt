Robot-world calibration plays an important role in practical robotic applications where offline programming is adopted. By finding the precise transformation between the base frame of the robot and the world frame, tasks that are usually defined in the world frame can be accurately transformed into the base frame of the robot, enabling successive motion planning and programming. The base frame calibration is also useful in multirobot cooperation where coordination of the robot bases is essential for cooperative manipulations. This paper presents a two-stage method to find the base frame of a robot in the world frame. A closed-form method serves as an initial value finder, and an iterative method refines the calibration accuracy. Comprehensive simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Theoretical analyses show that the accuracy of the solution will improve when: 1) the movement range of the robot is enlarged; 2) the size of the robot is expanded; 3) the distance between the base frame of the robot and the measurement/world frame is reduced; and 4) the distance between the marker and the origin of the hand frame is decreased. These conclusions provide useful guidance for the practical operations.
