One of the critical tasks in retail is to optimally manage the use of floor space within each store. Doing this correctly requires having accurate knowledge of the way in which space is currently used in the store, how this usage changes over time, and how this usage relates to sales. In a retail chain, such as Walgreens, which has over 8000 stores in the United States, this knowledge is difficult and expensive to obtain. Furthermore, each individual retail store may have dozens of different departments and may stock thousands of unique product types. While embedded-system and infrastructure-based solutions, such as radio-frequency identification tags, are technically straightforward, they are simply not scalable over a full product inventory. We present an autonomous system that uses computer vision to recognize products and departments and that is able to autonomously navigate around clutter and moving people. The only step that requires human input is manually driving the robot around the store to create an initial map of the shelf locations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a fully automated robotic inventory labeling system for a retail environment. The framework presented in this paper can also be used in other retail environments and in other indoor environments with organized shelves, such as business storage facilities and hospital pharmacies.
