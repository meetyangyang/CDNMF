Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is a wellestablished wireless technology for inventory, retail, and supply-chain management. Recently, several group codes based on low-density paritycheck (LDPC) matrices have been proposed to check the integrity of collections of RFID tagged objects and identify the number of missing tags, if any. Such checks do not require packaging lists or external databases, which can increase the operating speed and reduce costs. In this paper, we analyze these LDPC-based codes, find upper bounds for their performance, and show that there is a simpler approach that outperforms these requiring less memory. This questions the suitability of LDPC-based codes for such RFID applications.
