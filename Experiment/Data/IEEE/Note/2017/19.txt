The central message of this paper isthat aligning multiresolution data sets is important, but solvingit turns out to be a nasty problem. If one throws it intoan existing off-the-shelf optimization solution package, one isunlikely to be able to get any results at all for real-life-sizedproblems on the current computational hardware in any practicaltime horizon. If one uses a heuristic approach, the downside isthat the solution outcomes are not robust and could lead to considerable deterioration in the solution quality when using thecombined data sets. The proposed matching framework providesa competitive robust solution to this problem and can serve as agood offline tool to aid the geometric quality control process ofmanufactured parts.
