The new class of algorithms, suggested in this paper, not only compares favorably with the existing ones, but is also highly adjustable and scalable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that execution times are reasonable for offline optimization procedures. We demonstrate the implementation of our ideas using a Pioneer D3-PX mobile robot that imitates a Dubins vehicle.
