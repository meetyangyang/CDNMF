The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical networking strategy for the cooperative control of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems that have been widely applied in modeling robotic manipulators;  autonomous underwater vehicles;  and spacecrafts. Existing approaches are mainly based on the continuous-time communication network;  which are difficult to be implemented in the real-world applications. In addition;  energy consumption problems for multi-agent systems have received increasing attention in recent years;  which also motivate us to carry out the present study. Since continuous-time communications inevitably consume much energy;  how to find an effective way to reduce energy cost is an urgent task. Therefore;  this paper presents a novel method for communications among multiple Euler-Lagrange systems based on the sampled-data information;  where discrete-time communications are used instead of continuous-time communications. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can significantly reduce the transmission energy consumption. Furthermore;  both transmission delays and data packet dropouts are taken into account which make our results more applicable in practice.
