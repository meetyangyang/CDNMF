All parts are manufactured to tolerances as no production process is capable of delivering perfectly identical parts. It is unacceptable that a plan for a manipulation task that was determined on the basis of a CAD model of a part fails on some manufactured instances of that part, and therefore it is crucial that the admitted shape variations are systematically taken into account during the planning of the task. Most of the existing manipulation planning algorithms are based on the ideal assumption that the shape of the part is exact. In this paper, we study the problem of sensorless orientation of parts with shape variation. This paper presents an approach to orient an imperfect part by pushing with a single jaw under a very general model for shape variation.
