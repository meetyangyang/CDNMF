This paper summarizes our efforts inthe EU project AREUS in tackling the challenge to reduceenergy consumption of robots in manufacturing industries. Somerobot manufacturers, such as KUKA, have already implementedsimple heuristic energy saving features into their product, whichimprove the efficiency by reducing acceleration and velocity,i.e., increasing cycle time. We have, however, shown that it ispossible to decrease energy consumption and peak power withoutchanging either cycle time or path. Our technique comprises logging robot trajectories through software functionalities existingin the robots, optimizing it using a suitable cost function, andrunning the new trajectory. What distinguishes our work fromsimilar attempts is that it does not require system identificationor confidential robot data. We have tested our method on KUKArobots in our laboratory at Chalmers University of Technologyin Sweden, and in the laboratories at the German companiesKUKA Robotics GmbH and Daimler AG. The results show thatour optimization reduces up to 30% of energy consumption andup to 60% in peak power.
