Monitoring batch processes in the semiconductor manufacturing is currently a challenge. Methods available require complex preliminary alignment and modeling stages. We propose a new methodology for monitoring batch processes. This methodology is particularly suited to the applications found in this sectorâ€”it is simpler and more parsimonious than current two-way and three-way approaches (therefore less prone to over-fitting), flexible (can accommodate batches with different lengths), sensitive to process upsets, and does not require the complex and time-consuming alignment step in data pretreatment. Through validating with real data from semiconductor manufacturing industry, we demonstrate the practicability of the proposed translation-invariant multiscale energybased principal component analysis method.
