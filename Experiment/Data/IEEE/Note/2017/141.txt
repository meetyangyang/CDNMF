Autonomous systems designed for rehabilitation and functional assistance for people with disabilities such as paralysis have the potential to maximize rehabilitative outcomes and improve the quality of life for millions of people. Disorders such as paralysis drastically reduce a person’s ability to complete tasks due to a loss of neuromuscular control. Functional electrical stimulation can activate paralyzed muscles, restoring functional ability through automated application of electric current to the neuromuscular system, and, when applied to a task such as cycling, is both rehabilitative and empowering. However, cycling induced by functional electrical stimulation is limited by the capability of the rider’s muscles, so an electric motor is typically added to accommodate the rider’s ability and to support stability. The response by muscle to electrical stimulation is uncertain, time-varying, and nonlinear, and switching the control input across multiple muscle groups and between the rider and an electric motor make guaranteeing stability and performance challenging. This paper presents a novel approach to the challenge of controlling motorized cycling systems with functional electrical stimulation that considers the switching effects and guarantees exponentially stable tracking of a desired crank trajectory, and experimental results indicate how the control system may be applied to a rehabilitative cycling task. Directions for future research are aimed at implementation of the developed control system in patient populations with paralysis to quantify its impact on therapeutic outcomes such as muscle function and neuroplasticity.
