At present, many manufacturing enterprises are adopting the multi-variety and small batch manufacturing mode. In this mode, every customer order consists of different product types, and the entire order should be delivered simultaneously. Thus, committing a delivery due date for an orderand increasing the utilization rate of manufacturing resources arekey issues among manufacturing managers. This study presents anefficient linearized model to address the aforementioned problem.A hybrid nested partitions-based algorithm is designed and implemented to solve large-scale problem instances. An advantageof the proposed algorithm is that it can be potentially extendedby incorporating domain knowledge and management experience.This approach indicates that several specific rules or techniquescan be used when designing and implementing algorithms to improve efficiency.
