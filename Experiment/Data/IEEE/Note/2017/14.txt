The era of the Internet of Thingsdemands effective means to analyze a huge amount of available data in order to extract meaningful insight. This task hasbeen limited to data scientists due to its intricate nature andsteep learning curve. To empower the layman, we propose asystem that automatically generates recommended workflows forclassification tasks and performs remote and parallel execution ofthe workflow in a cloud computing environment efficiently. Oursystem receives an input data set from the user and extracts itsunique features. This is compared with a repository of data setâ€“workflow pairs to select appropriate workflows. These workflowsare intelligently aggregated into a better performing version usingan evolutionary algorithm. Upon completion of the classificationtask, users can choose to contribute the results back into therepository, which could improve subsequent system performance.The approach described is fully automatic and requires no userintervention. This makes it an ideal tool for layman users.To ascertain that the system performs sufficiently well, we testedit on 114 data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repositoryand compared the classification accuracies of our recommendedworkflows with those of the single classifiers in the OpenML.The results showed that our system is able to generate workflowswith accuracies that are among the top-ranked classifiers in theOpenML and sometimes even better.
