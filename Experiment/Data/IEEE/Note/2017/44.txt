This paper is motivated by the multi-objective problem of redundant robot manipulators in practicalapplications. Note that redundant robot manipulators are usuallyrequired to handle the multiple objectives simultaneously in acomplex environment. Thus, a physically realizable, operationallystable, and safe solution for such redundant robot manipulatorsis significant for practitioners. This paper proposes a hybridmulti-objective scheme to complete simultaneously multiple objectives of redundant robot manipulators. Besides, for the convenienceof practitioners to develop in applications, the correspondingnumerical algorithm with its block diagram given for the optimalsolution of the proposed scheme is also presented. Computer simulation based on a six-link planar redundant robot manipulatorshows that the four mentioned objectives are completed well.The proposed scheme is also applied to a six-link physical robotmanipulator system to substantiate further its effectiveness.
