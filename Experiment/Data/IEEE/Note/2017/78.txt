Given that the byproduct gas system in steel industry can hardly be described by a physics or mechanism-based model;  its operation is widely realized by the experience-based manual measure at present;  which exhibits a very low automation level. Since a large number of real-time energy data have been accumulated by the existing SCADA system implemented in most of steel plants;  a novel data-driven real-time predictive optimization method is proposed in this study. The proposed method aims at the short term energy optimization;  thus the sample interval of the real-time data acquired from the SCADA system is set as 1 minute. The application system can provide the rolling optimized solution via real-time predicting the running circumstances of the gas system. Therefore;  it is required for the plant in advance to implement the SCADA system for the energy data acquisition;  and the sampling interval should be less than or equal to 1 minute. Furthermore;  it is necessary for the sample data to complete the preliminary processing such as data imputation if needed since there are usually a large number of possible missing data points existed in the SCADA system of the production practice. Because such preliminary processing for the sample data belongs to a class of generic methods;  this study avoids the redundant technical introduction.
