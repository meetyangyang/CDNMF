This paper was motivated by theproblem of implementing denoising and signal enhancement for Raman spectra to realize inline process monitoring andquality control of continuous nanomanufacturing of carbonnanotube (CNT) buckypaper. Existing approaches like waveletdenoising cannot deal with signal dependent noise buried in theRaman spectra effectively. This paper develops a signal analysismodel and validates the signal-noise dependence property. Thena novel generalized wavelet shrinkage approach is used to removenoise in each wavelet coefficient by applying individual adaptivewavelet threshold. With this new approach, signal-noise ratiocan be improved efficiently, and process monitoring accuracyand sensitivity can be enhanced effectively. This paper provides asolid foundation for inline process monitoring and quality controlfor continuous nanomanufacturing of CNT buckypaper. Furthermore, the developed methodology can be applied into denoisingsignal-dependent noise in other kinds of signals. In future work,we will develop a process monitoring approach of multistagenanomanufacturing process
