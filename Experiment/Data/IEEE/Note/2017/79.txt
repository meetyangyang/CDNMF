Because deviation appears when a waferis first put on the working table, the traditional process is to set upa prealignment system when aligning a new type of wafer. However, different templates increase difficulty for machine operators,and decrease automation and reliability of the devices. This papertherefore proposes a new general prealignment algorithm basedon using Fourier transform for orientation prealignment andleast square regression for position prealignment. The algorithmwas tested on two types of wafer with results showing thatthe orientation prealignment achieved an accuracy of 0.05Â°,the position prealignment achieved an accuracy of 5 pixels,and the average operation time was about 1.5 s, all of whichmeet real-time requirements. Although the algorithm can beadapted to different wafers without adjustment, it does not fitnonquadrilateral chips very well. Accordingly, we will developan improved algorithm with better generality in due course.
