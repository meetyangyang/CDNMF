This paper extends the existing theoryof deadlock avoidance for buffer-space allocation in flexiblyautomated production systems so that it accounts for disruptiveeffects due to potential temporary outages of some of the systemservers. The set of the failing servers at any time instant definesthe corresponding operational mode for the underlying resourceallocation system. The primary problem that is addressed bythis paper is the synthesis of a resource allocation policy thatwill ensure the ability of all process instances that do not requirethe failing resources in a particular mode, to execute repetitivelyand complete successfully while the system remains in thatmode. In line with some past literature on this problem, wecall the corresponding supervisory control problem as “robustdeadlock avoidance,” and we leverage results from the recentlyemerged theory for modeling and control of switched discreteevent systems in order to characterize and compute a maximallypermissive solution for it.
