Piezoelectric nanopositioning stageexhibits hysteretic nonlinearity, which poses a great obstacle toachieve a precision motion control. This paper considers thehysteresis and other uncertainties as a lumped disturbance tothe nominal plant model, and suppresses the disturbance using arobust control based on sliding mode control (SMC) scheme. Themajor issue of SMC lies in the chattering phenomenon presentin the control action, which can break the actuator and exciteunwanted dynamics of the system. To eliminate the chatteringeffect, a new adaptive SMC (ASMC) strategy is proposed in thispaper by resorting to uncertainty and disturbance estimation(UDE) technique. The presented ASMC-UDE strategy is easy toimplement because it eliminates the use of a hysteresis model anda reference system model. Experimental results demonstrate theeffectiveness of the reported control scheme in nanopositioningtasks. The reported ASMC-UDE idea can also be extended torobust control of other types of systems.
