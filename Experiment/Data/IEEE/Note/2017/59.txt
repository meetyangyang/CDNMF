Welding is the final stage for manufacturing of many high-value-added products. Current industrialwelding robots are basically pre-programmed actuators withlimited, if any, intelligence. Given that manufacturing is movingtowards more customized production, next-generation weldingrobots that can intelligently adjust to various welding tasks areurgently needed. This paper provides a convenient data-drivenmethod to learn human welder intelligence. A foundation is thusestablished to mechanize the human welder's intelligence anddevelop next generation welding robots.
