Complex systems often require multiple units simultaneously working in parallel to meet a specific objective. For example, this parallel configuration usually exists in manufacturing processes, which provide some level of natural redundancy to prevent the loss of production yield due to machine failure or scheduled maintenance. However, without an active control strategy, it is not uncommon that a number of units are likely to exhibit a similar degradation path and thus lead to an overlap of unit failures. In such a case, the production requirement may not be satisfied by the remaining functional units. To prevent this incident, the paper presents a novel approach that aims at dynamically adjusting the workload assigned to each unit to actively control its degradation path and failure time. Specifically, our method is based on the assumption that the degradation rate of a unit is directly related to its workload. To implement this method, it is necessary: 1) to identify the key units that operate in the system; 2) to estimate the general relationship between the workload and the degradation rate of an individual unit using historical data and domain knowledge; 3) to understand the failure threshold and the repair time of each unit; and 4) to use online condition monitoring techniques to monitor the degradation level of each unit. With all of this information available, the proposed method predicts the future degradation level as well as the residual life of a unit under various workload assignments. Based on the predicted residual life, our method then provides a heuristic workload adjustment strategy that aims to prevent the overlap of unit failures. Our empirical results show that the proposed method consistently yields less overlap of unit failures and less loss of production than other commonly used strategies in practice, such as equal or random workload assignment strategy.
