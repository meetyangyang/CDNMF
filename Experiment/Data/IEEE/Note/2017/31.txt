Renewable energy can play a key rolein producing local, clean, and inexhaustible energy to supplythe worldâ€™s increasing demand for electricity. Photovoltaic (PV)conversion of solar energy is a promising solution and is thebest fit in several situations. However, its intermittent natureremains a real difficulty that can create instability. To answerto the new constraints of connection to the network (gridcodes) for either solar plant than distributed generation, onepossible solution is the use of direct current (DC) MicroGrids,including storage systems, in order to integrate the electric powergenerated by these PV arrays. One of the main reasons isthe fact that PV panels, batteries, supercapacitors, and electricvehicles are DC. On the other hand, reliable stable control ofDC MicroGrids is still an open problem. In particular, it lacksrigorous analysis that can establish the operation regions andstability conditions for such MicroGrids. Current works thatconsider realistic grids usually apply from-the-shelf solutionsthat do not study the dynamics of such grids. While morerigorous studies just consider too much simplified grids thatdo not represent the conditions from real life applications, thispaper presents nonlinear controllers capable to stabilize the DCMicroGrid, with rigorous analysis on the sufficient conditionsand region of operation of the proposed control.
