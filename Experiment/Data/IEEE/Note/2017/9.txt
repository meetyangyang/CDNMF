This paper solves the precision motioncontrol problem for servomechanisms subject to nonlinear friction, model uncertainties, and external disturbances, which aredifficult to be modeled in practical applications. We will presentan alternative control method to achieve guaranteed transientand steady-state error convergence performance. Moreover, weconsider all lumped uncertainties as an augmented unknownsystem state, and then address their effect by using an extendedstate observer (ESO). The parameters of ESO are designed basedon the control system bandwidth only. Practical experimentalresults with a turntable servo system reveal that the proposedcontroller is more effective than proportional–integral–derivativecontroller and a typical adaptive controller in terms of controlperformance. The simpler implementation and the reducedcomputational cost are also profitable in practice. Thus, thispaper suggests a method for practitioners interested in developingmotion controller for servomechanisms. Potential applicationsinclude aerospace, robotic systems, electrical vehicles, and marinesystems.
