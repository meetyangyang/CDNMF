The Ramadge–Wonham supervisory control paradigm offers many useful tools for engineers designing control structures for complex systems such as manufacturing systems. In particular, it provides many tools for verifying whether a target system satisfies given safety and/or liveness specifications. When the system does not satisfy such specifications, it provides tools for synthesizing a proper supervisory controller to prevent behaviors that violate the specifications, which are applicable to extremely large systems. In this paper, we extend the Ramadge–Wonham paradigm to synthesize a time optimal controller for a manufacturing system, which we call a time optimal accepting trace. This is achieved by iteratively using abstraction to simplify subsystems in such a way that an optimal trace can still be found, even though the target system’s state space may be far larger than that can be fit in a computer’s memory. We test our new approach on large linear cluster tools by finding an optimal schedule of robots in order to process a batch of wafers with a minimum makespan, i.e., a minimum time for completing all wafer processing tasks.
