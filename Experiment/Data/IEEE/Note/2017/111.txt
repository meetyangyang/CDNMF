This paper was motivated by the problem of assembling electronic components through PCBs using automated surface mount machines. Besides the fact that a capable automated machine can directly improve the assembly productivity, we believe that good planning for PCBA is also important as a minor improvement on the assembly time for one PCB can lead to a significant cost reduction for a large batch. For PCBA, CSP and FAP are two essential problems and they can directly affect the assembly time of a PCB. To deal with the two problems, current practice mainly depends on engineersâ€™ experience or a simple heuristic rule instead of advanced approaches. Though some studies have proposed GAs to solve the two problems together, PSO is found with the potential to better deal with the two problems. This has prompted us to develop PSO-based approaches to deal with the two problems simultaneously. Our preliminary experiments showed that the PSO-based approaches have a better performance than the two genetic-based approaches. PSO2 is found being a good approach after comparing it with an exact approach.
