Optimization-based techniques are viewed as a great success in industrial and engineering applications. With the rapid growth of requirements for optimization algorithms, such as faster convergence and higher accuracy, heuristic optimization algorithms are attracting more and more attention. The proposed multiagent coordination optimization algorithm is a novel heuristic optimization algorithm created by merging multiagent coordination and swarm intelligence together to accelerate the search for the optimal solution. Moreover, the parallelization technique described in this paper greatly reduces the computational time of the algorithm for large-scale optimization problems. This significantly benefits the demand for faster convergence and higher accuracy when solving complex, largescale industrial problems, such as load balancing coordination, multiagent formation control, and power system vulnerability analysis.
