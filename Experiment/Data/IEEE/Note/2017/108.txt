This paper was motived by the limitations of current manual patch clamp recording that requires a complex procedure to measure the electrical signal through the specific ion channel of a single cell. As ion channels act as the molecular targets for drug therapies, automated patchclamp platforms have been extensively developed to automatically conduct the ion channels recordings but it has still been challenging to achieve a high-yield measurement, because the contact between the measurement pipette tip and the cell has to be precisely controlled. It is extremely difficult for the current automated system to determine the contact condition when the cells are in different sizes and properties. We developed a new approach for the patch clamp system to automatically perform patch clamp recording on adherent cells and algorithmically detect cell conditions by analyzing electrical resistance changes. The control algorithm for automated patch clamp execution was developed and the system was demonstrated to successfully form the gigaseal and measure the transmembrane current of different types of cells. The system not only avoids suspension procedures of adherent cells, but also expands the capability of conventional automated patch-clamp systems to directly study the ion channel activity of a diverse range of cells at single cell level more precisely and effectively. The electrical resistance feedback system can be further developed by adjusting the critical parameter in the control algorithm and integrating a visual-based feedback so that different types of adherent cells can be studied, and thus wider its applications in biomedical fields, including study of cell function and signaling pathway, disease research, drug screening, and discovery.
