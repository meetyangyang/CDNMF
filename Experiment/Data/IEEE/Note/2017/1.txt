The classification model is a predictivemodel and can be used to classify new data. An implementation ofthe approach would consist in: 1) data acquisition; 2) compositionof the learning data sets; 3) feature extraction, unsupervisedtraining, and supervised grouping for a few different systems tobe tested; 4) validation consisting of a qualitative visual inspectionof the results of the tested systems; 5) selection of the system thatperformed the best; and 6) runtime operation with the selectedsystem. Applications of our system include terrain traversabilityanalysis, rapid production of an operational semantic model inthe case of search and rescue, reference in a comparison ofdifferent classification systems, and labeling of a data set or,equivalently, the production of ground truth.
