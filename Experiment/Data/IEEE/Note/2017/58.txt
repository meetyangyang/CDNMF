This paper was motivated by theachieving high accuracy of positioning the CCM. Existing approaches on the CCM only consider the control and modelingproblems when the cable-conduit configuration is unchangedor little changed and the exact values of model parameters arerequired. This paper suggested new approaches on the controlproblems of the CCM regardless of the changes of the cable-conduit configuration. We mathematically modeled and designeda controller using nonlinear and adaptive algorithm. The exactvalues of nonlinear model parameters were not required andonly their bounds were estimated. Experimental validations werecarried out on a real flexible robotic system and the results demonstrated feasible practical applications. In future research, we willapply the proposed control scheme to higher degrees of cable-conduit mechanism-driven robotic systems using non-conventionalsensors like magnetic trackers or image processing to provide theoutput position feedback.
