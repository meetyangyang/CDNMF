Customer orders usually consist of multiple product types with unknown workload. They arrive dynamically to a processing facility and have to be delivered together in a single shipment when finished. The problem of customer order scheduling appears in many industries such as manufacturing, auto repair, and retail where consideration of customer orders rather than individual jobs is often preferred. Two widely applied production schemes, namely, workload assignment scheme (WAS) and server assignment scheme (SAS), are explored in this paper. Despite the stochastic nature of the problem, this paper has managed to show that, under both production schemes, the throughputs maximization problems can be solved by corresponding linear programs through which the optimal throughputs and assignment can be easily obtained. This paper also provides the analytical forms of the optimal throughputs and assignments for some important special cases. In addition, this paper shows that WAS and SAS share the same optimal throughputs, and the corresponding optimal assignments are closely related. These results highlight the underlying equivalency between WAS and SAS, which contributes to the understanding of the operational mechanisms of different production schemes. Additional characteristics of customer orders, such as returns, setups, and due dates, will be explored in the future research.
