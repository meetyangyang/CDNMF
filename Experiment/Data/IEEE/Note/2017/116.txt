This paper was motivated by the necessity of reducing utility costs in terms of energy consumption in large-scale enterprises. Determination of the lowest cost method of providing the required amount of electricity heavily relies on accurate load demand forecast. In addition, demand forecasting problems also exist in various fields, including supply chain management, manufacturing, and microgrid networks. This paper provides an eminent approach to estimate the posterior state (i.e., demand in forthcoming periods) given the prior states (i.e., past demand) and measurements. In this paper, we mathematically derive the method using the minimum relative entropy principle. To validate the proposed method, a series of synthetic experiments are designed, and a case study of shortterm electricity demand forecasting is carried out. The results obtained from the proposed method have been benchmarked against those obtained from four other approaches that exist in the literature. In future research, we will extend the application scope of this paper to tracking in naval radar systems and state estimation in distributed power systems with renewables.
