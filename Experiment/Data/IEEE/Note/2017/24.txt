This work is motivated by the needfor advanced network control and automation tools for theeffective operation of power distribution networks with high distributed generation (DG) integration. The increasing penetrationof variable DG, e.g., wind turbines and photovoltaics, can causeovervoltages and/or feeder overloads. To deal with these issues,current studies examine the control of the DG active and reactivepower. DG curtailment is very effective to deal with voltage riseissues; however, it has financial consequences for DG ownersand this can be a barrier to further DG penetration. This paperintroduces a convex model for the online reconfiguration of activedistribution networks that minimizes DG curtailment, relievesline congestion, and improves voltage profile. The proposedconvex optimization model is applied to different distribution testsystems. The results show that the application of the networkreconfiguration as an active network management scheme caneliminate DG curtailment, which means that the exploitation ofDG output power into the network is maximized.
