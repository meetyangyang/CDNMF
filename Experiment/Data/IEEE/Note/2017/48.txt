Existing energy-saving (ES) systems oftenheavily rely on detecting presence of residents to achieve intuitivebut less human-centric energy savings. Moreover, they often ignored the potential conflicts among users, which may lead to unpleasant user experience. To address these practical issues, the authors proposed a new and more comprehensive comfort index toevaluate how users real feel in a multiuser environment. Such concerns can improve product readiness for smart home related applications and put users in the cycle of designing attentive ES services. The key components of the system can be readily integrated intoa home gateway to facilitate the development of smart home systems. Preliminary evaluations suggest that the approach is feasibleand can achieve energy savings by at least 28%. However, since thesystem focuses more on what activities are undertaken rather thanwho undertakes the activities, this may fail to provide personalizedES services. Such a limitation can be solved by incorporating useridentification related techniques such as face recognition, RFIDs,etc. In the next phase of the study, experiments will be conductedin real and more houses for more realistic evaluations.
