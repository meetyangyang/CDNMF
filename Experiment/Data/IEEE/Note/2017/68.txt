 Machines with job cascading (or cluster tools) are commonly seen in semiconductor manufacturingprocesses. While meeting production move targets is a commongoal for the nondelayed jobs, catching up with the schedule is animportant task for the delayed jobs to achieve higher customerservice level. From the viewpoint of scheduling, reducing thedelay is equivalent to reducing completion time. Hence, wepropose scheduling algorithms to reduce the completion time bytaking advantage of the special structure of a cascading machine.In contrast to existing scheduling theory, the proposed algorithmcan be efficient due to the small maximum batch size of realcascading machines. In addition to the theoretical contributions,this paper aims at solving practical problems through a rigorousapproach. The finding and insight from this paper can be usedto enhance shop floor control in a semiconductor fab.
