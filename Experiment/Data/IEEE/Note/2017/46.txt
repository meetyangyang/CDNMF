Defects detection is a major challengein numerous industrial applications. This contribution is of particular interest for tire manufacturers for which pneumatic tiredefect detection mainly rely on human vision. Using computerbased technologies and signal processing methods based on wavelettransform, this paper proposes an efficient approach to implementthe detection operations in a systematic way. Moreover, the proposed method is also extendable to other defect detection problemswith image processing.
