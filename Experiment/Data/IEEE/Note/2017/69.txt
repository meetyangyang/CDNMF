Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-basednanomanipulation has become a promising approach in developing devices and structures at nanoscale. One of the prerequisitesfor the effective and successful nanomanipulation is that theAFM tip position relative to the interest region can be controlled accurately. This paper proposes a stochastic approach forfeature-based localization and planning method to solve theseproblems. The uncertainties of the tip position are decreased byusing the Kalman filter method in the localization procedure.Fifty times of experiments are represented to illustrate theeffectiveness and efficiency of the tip positioning method. Then,basic nanomanipulations in the vertical direction without andwith SAFLP method are performed for representing significanceof positioning the tip. Furthermore, assembling nanostructuresand following the carbon nanotube are carried out by usingSAFLP. These experiments indicate that accurate positioning tipin AFM-based observation and manipulation can provide validnanomanipulation in N/MEMS assembly, and the following nanoobjects such as nanotube in real-time observation, which willpromote automation implementation in nanomanipulation.
