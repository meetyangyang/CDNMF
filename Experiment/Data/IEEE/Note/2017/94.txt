This paper experimentally demonstrates the capability of an online parameter learning algorithm on the Baxter Research Robot to improve task performance. This type of algorithm could enable automated systems to actively inspect multibody parts for parametric information, including estimation of the robotâ€™s own inertias. The method requires known equations of motion for any nonlinear system with uncertain, constant parameters. We show using a series of 18 experimental trials that using the estimation method results in improved task performance for automated dynamical motions given uncertain parameters.
