This paper was motivated by the challenging problem of automated transportation of grouped cellsto several predefined task regions in emerging cell surgery withmultiple processing steps. Existing automated cell transportation studies are mainly single-task oriented, thereby makingthem inapplicable to cell surgery operations, because a seriesof sequential processing steps are usually involved in theseoperations. This paper provides a novel control strategy based ona robot-aided optical tweezers manipulation system to efficientlytransport cells into different task regions sequentially without interruption. Unlike the previous cell transportation studieswhere the goal positions of single cells must be specified early,here only the desired task regions are identified in the controllerimplementation, making the proposed strategy a better fit foractual cell surgery practice.
