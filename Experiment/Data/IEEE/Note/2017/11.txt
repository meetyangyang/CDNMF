Soft sensing of quality/key variables iscritical to the control and optimization of chemical industrialprocesses. The traditional probabilistic supervised latent factoranalysis method can capture the trend of process, but cannotachieve a high prediction accuracy. This paper aims to developa high-accuracy soft sensor based on locally weighted methodfor processes, which contain strong nonlinearity and abruptionpoints. To fully implement this approach, it is necessary to:1) select a historical data set with abundant information of theprocess; 2) calculate the similarities between the historical and thenew query data samples; 3) establish a locally weighted modelbased on the similarities and make the prediction; and 4) toacquire sufficient data set to enrich the historical data set andfurther enhance the prediction performance. Two real industrialprocesses have shown that the proposed approach provided asatisfactory prediction accuracy.
