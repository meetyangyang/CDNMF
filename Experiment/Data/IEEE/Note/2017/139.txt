This paper is motivated by the elastic resource provisioning problem of virtual data centers in clouds which are managed by scientific research institutes, or small or middlesized enterprises, to minimize the total resource renting cost of cloud workflow applications. For example, when we rent virtual machines from Amazon EC2 for big-data analysis applications, the number and the type of rented virtual machines change in terms of saving on renting costs. Because virtual machines are priced in intervals in most commercial clouds, tasks must be properly scheduled on rented virtual machines to improve the utilization of rented intervals. Existing methods do not factor in software setup times, yet these have an impact on scheduling effectiveness (especially for the cases when tasks have shorter execution times than software setup times). In this paper, a heuristic called MRH is developed for elastic virtual machine provisioning. Similarly, practical factors (utilization of rented intervals, VM loading time, software setup, data transfer, execution efficiency, the match between the length of time slots and that of task executions) are considered in MRH. Experimental results on realistic applications show that MRH could decrease virtual machine renting costs by up to 78.57%. Furthermore, MRH is fast which could meet the quick reaction times required in modern IT applications in rented virtual data centers (such as data centers built on Amazon EC2).
