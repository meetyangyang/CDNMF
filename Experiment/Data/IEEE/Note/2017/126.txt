This paper was motivated by the problem of sensor fault detection and recognition which, to a great extent, can reflect the overall performance of the complex information system. The identification part can be applied to other multiclassification problems. Existing approaches to detect sensor fault with least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) suffer from nonsparse problem, which blocks the prediction speed, especially in industrial operations where high efficiency is needed. In this paper, by changing the threshold, we can adjust the number of the vector groups, decrease the number of support vectors, reduce the dimension size and improve the operation speed. Meanwhile, we proposed a novel method to sensor fault identification which bridges multiclass problems and binary-class classifiers with Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Compared with other methods, ECOC-SVM can lead to higher accuracy, while it needs slightly more time than one-versus-one method. In future research, we will further improve the efficiency of ECOC-SVM to achieve better real-time performance.
