Online monitoring for batch processhas always been a hard point in real industry. In this paper, anovel phase partition and online monitoring algorithm based onMBEAM is proposed, which can separate the process into majorphases and transition patterns automatically. Because of its simpleand intuitive format, it has superior performance in computationefficiency and fault interpretation, which makes it convenientfor industrial application. Moreover, the experimental resultspresented can be reproduced effortlessly.
