This paper forwards novel Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture (DPGM) models for online process quality monitoring. The practical outcome is that the deleterious impact of process drifts on product quality is identified in their early stages using the presented DPGM models. For instance;  sensor signal patterns from contemporary advanced manufacturing processes rarely follow distribution symmetry or normality assumptions endemic to traditional statistical process control (SPC) methods. These assumptions limit the effectiveness of traditional SPC methods for detection of process anomalies from complex heterogeneous sensor data. In comparison;  the proposed DP-based SPC is capable of detecting process changes in the sensor data notwithstanding the characteristics of the underlying distributions. Moreover;  we show that the recurrent hierarchical DP clustering model identifies process anomalies with higher fidelity compared with traditional methods;  such as mean shift clustering.
