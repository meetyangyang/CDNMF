With the advancement of autonomous technology, robotic systems have alleviated human operators from numerous tedious tasks where system endurance plays a crucial role. Current technology employed in solar-powered robotic systems is subject to design and power limitations and varying environments. Intelligently harvesting energy from environments and scheduling power consumption to optimize desired system performance will significantly improve the solar robot's endurance. Therefore, the goal of realizing energy autonomy of solar-powered robotic systems motivates this work. Any robotic system which can access solar energy will potentially benefit from the results of this work. With solar panels integrated into robotic systems applied to missions such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance, and farming, the proposed path planning and power management strategy has the potential to dramatically extend the operation time of a system.
