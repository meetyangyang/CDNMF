Automatic diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases based on physiological signals is critical for healthcare service improvement. The information loss and unreliability, as well as inconsistency in the signal pattern for different individuals, increase the probability of incorrect diagnosis for current diagnostic methods. This paper aims to overcome these limitations existing in current studies by proposing a general Gamma CUSUM-based detection scheme. To fully implement this approach, it is necessary (i) to preprocess the heart rate variability signals and eliminate unexpected signal points; (ii) to establish prior distribution for the hyperparameter of reference state distribution based on the training data; and (iii) to collect the sufficient dataset to further enhance the performance. A real-world case study has shown that the proposed diagnostic approach provided a satisfactory diagnostic accuracy.
