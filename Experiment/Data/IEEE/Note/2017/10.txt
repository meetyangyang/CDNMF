This paper presents a new Researchand Development project named RWiN for the development ofreconfigurable wireless sensor networks (RWSNs). An RWSN isan adaptive WSN to its environment under different constraintsdescribed in user requirements. A run-time reconfiguration ofnodes is applied in three levels: software, hardware, and datarouting. The RWiN project suggests a new design methodologyto analyze, construct, develop, and verify easily RWSN architectures. We propose a metamodel of RWSN based on unifiedmodeling language and a zone-based multiagent architecture tohandle the reconfiguration scenarios. Each agent is modeledby nested state machines to handle the design complexity.To verify the properties of the communicating agents, eachone is modeled by a timed automaton and model checking is applied by using UPPAAL. A case study is considered for moreevaluations of the proposed contribution. This paper reports acomplete methodology for the development of RWSNs from theformal modeling to the final code generation. It can be a futurereference for industrial partners who will be focusing on variousWSN-based adaptive applications. In future research, the RWiNproject will be extended to consider the automatic adaptationof zones by modifying their sizes. It will also be extended todeal with mobile nodes that can be reconfigured while providingmobile services.
