The primary care delivery system isunder a lot of strain. Due to population growth and aging,and the expanded healthcare insurance coverage, the demandfor primary care services has increased substantially in the pastyears. Patients have difficulty of getting timely access to care,while primary care physicians are facing insurmountable tasks.Electronic visit, or e-visit, as an alternative to the traditional officevisit, provides an innovative way of patient–physician communication through securing messages. The successful implementationof e-visit relies on a proper understanding of the impact of e-visiton care access, and an appropriate design and scheduling ofworkforce and operations. Therefore, the objective of this paperis to develop an analytical model of the primary care deliverywith e-visits, using which one can investigate the impact ofe-visits on patient accessibility. In particular, the average valueand variance of patients’ length of visit for their encounters areevaluated. Different policies for physicians to schedule office ande-visit patients are compared. In addition, physicians’ nondirectcare activities, such as billings and documentations, are alsoconsidered in the model.
