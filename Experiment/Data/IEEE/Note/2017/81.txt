The main goal of this paper is todemonstrate the possibility of WiFi-based positioning technologyand analytical methodology for analyzing indoor movement inthe era of Big Data and the Internet of Things. Recently, withadvances in communication, sensors, and wearable computingtechnologies, strong interest has been shown in marketing andretail behavior studies that can capture customer travel data inoff-line stores to inform and improve sales and marketing. As theapplication of off-line store behavior analysis for behavior studiesand marketing gains momentum, this paper can be used as afoundation for the development of sensor-based location analysissystems or devices for off-line stores. The focus of this paperis not to investigate customer behavior related to the displaychange nor the behavioral science related to retail. Rather, weexperimentally demonstrate the value of the proposed technologyand the process mining technique for future research.
