In order to reduce energy usage inmanufacturing systems, processing times for tasks/operations canbe extended. This results in less power consumption and thusmore energy-efficient systems. In current industrial applicationsof energy optimization for the automotive industry, the lack ofprotection against disruptions has been identified. One approachto handle disruptions is to add idle time to production schedulesto absorb possible delays. Thus, a conflict arises when combiningmethods to generate schedules that are energy efficient and thatwill perform well when disruptions, e.g., processing time delays,are present. In this paper, we analyze this tradeoff and presenta method to generate production schedules, taking both energyefficiency and sensitivity toward disruptions into account.
