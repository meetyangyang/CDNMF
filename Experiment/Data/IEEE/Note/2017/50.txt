This paper addresses the problem oflocation variation of EMG electrodes in walking assist systems. Existing systems lacking consideration of this issue do notguarantee reliable performance. This paper establishes a user-centered design principle of a gait phase recognition system thatcontrols for this covariate. For this, we develop a special sensingsuit allowing for the control of electrode placement and a reliabledata acquisition. We them combine a statistical, model-based, andempirical analysis to quantify the effect of electrode location variation on the prediction power of thirty types of EMG feature sets.The experimental results suggest that this approach is capableof identifying reliable EMG feature types that are robust againstelectrode location variation, as well as providing case-by-casesystem organization scenarios intended for the application ofEMG signal-based walking assist systems to various types ofsmart homes. In future work, it would be beneficial to apply thisprinciple to practical problems for building EMG signal-baseddevices, such as clinical assistive devices and walking assist devicesfor the elderly.
