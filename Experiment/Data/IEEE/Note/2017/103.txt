In industrial practice, controllers to realize sequential procedures for processes such as multistep production schemes are very often designed manually, i.e., the designer selects a sequence of control actions based on an intuition of what has to be triggered next in order to get to a goal state. Such procedure (leading to controllers implemented often on a PLC) is of combinatorial nature and thus typically time-consuming and error-prone. To avoid several iterations over testing and correcting the controllers, the algorithmic and modelbased synthesis is proposed as a reasonable alternative in this paper: a distributed discrete process is first modeled by modular discrete-event models, which explicitly account for the dependencies among the process units. While it is often difficult for a given process to manually select one out of many feasible control strategies, the algorithms for control synthesis proposed in this paper employ optimization to determine the behavior, which is most favorable with respect to costs associated with the model.
