Present quality assessment of ampoule injections in pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on manual operation by certified technologists or machine-assisted detection systems. Existing technologies are not able to effectively distinguish symbols/dirt on the surface of an ampoule, air bubbles, and random noise from foreign particles inside the ampoule. This paper reports an automated ampoule inspection system consisting of two working stations (high-speed revolving station and abruptly stopping station). The system agitates particles and rotates them spirally along the axis of the ampoule container. Based on image processing and trajectories construction, foreign particles are effectively detected and distinguished from air bubbles and random noise.
