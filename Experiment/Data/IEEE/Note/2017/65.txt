Traditional fault diagnosis and prognosis (FDP) approaches are based on the Riemann sampling(RS) method, in which samples are taken and algorithms areexecuted in periodic time intervals no matter if it is necessary.To reduce computation and make optimal use of computationalresources, Lebesgue sampling method is introduced into FDP.In this Lebesgue sampling-based approach, Lebesgue states aredefined on the fault dimension axis and algorithm is executed only when the measurement causes a transition from one Lebesguestate to another, or an event happens. Different from RS-basedapproach, this is a need-based FDP philosophy in which thealgorithm is executed only when necessary. This paper studiesa parameter adaption method to optimally adjust the Lebesguestate length, which results in the changes of number and locationof Lebesgue states, according to fault state and fault growthspeed to accommodate the nonlinearity of fault dynamics andachieve a balance between computation and performance. Theapplication to the capacity degradation of a set of Li-ion batteriesis presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposedadaptive Lebesgue state length FDP method.
