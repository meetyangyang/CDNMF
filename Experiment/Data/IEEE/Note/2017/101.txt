Healthcare facilities with limited resources, for example, emergency departments in the U.S. and expert physicians in China, are always inundated with waiting patients. Even the most experienced doctors or nurses can experience difficulties in dealing with multiple patients in a waiting area. Irrational access control may aggravate the conflict between patients and service providers. This paper proposes a real-time access control policy to reduce the total waiting dissatisfaction (disutility) of patients. To guarantee the real-time property of the control policy, a discriminating inequality with a simple switching curve, which was derived from the myopic optimal situation, is proposed. With the implementation of an automatic call-in system based on this admission control policy, outpatient clinics can immediately decide which patient to prioritize, and a tradeoff between patient distinction and fairness can be warranted.
