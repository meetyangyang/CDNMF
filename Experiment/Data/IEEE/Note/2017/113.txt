This paper is motivated by the sensitivity analysis need arising from building energy simulation model calibration. Calibration procedures demand excessive parameter tuning and exorbitant simulations. A sensitivity analysis is thereby well advocated, since it helps identify those parameters that hold more effects to the building energy performance than others and should earn more attention when parameters are tuned. In this paper, we propose a local method via algorithmic differentiation for fast sensitivity analysis to facilitate building model calibration. In comparison with random-sampling-based methods, the proposed method can achieve similarly desired results, but is much more time-efficient.
