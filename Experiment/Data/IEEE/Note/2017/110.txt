This paper was motivated by the problem of inspecting confined spaces for rust and flaking paint with a manipulator robot arm. Existing approaches involve creating a large set of candidate robot poses to take a scan from. Evaluating all these candidate poses is very time consuming if full coverage is guaranteed. This paper suggests a principled method for restricting the size of this set in a way that does not reduce inspection coverage but decreases overall time taken for inspection.
