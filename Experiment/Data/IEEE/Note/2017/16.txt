Secrecy is the ability to hide privateinformation. For communicated information, this can be donethrough encryption or access control. However, the same is notpossible for system behaviors, and in contrast, cover is introducedfor providing ambiguity. Quantifying the ability to hide secretsis a challenge. This paper provides a means to quantify this interms of a type of distance measure between a secret and itscover. A computation of the same is also provided for partiallyobserved stochastic discrete event systems and illustrated througha cacheâ€™s side-channel secrecy loss example.
