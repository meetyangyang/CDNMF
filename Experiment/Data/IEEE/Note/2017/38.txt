Recently, advanced technologies ingeographic information systems and global positioning systemshave supplied more opportunities for the prediction of futuredriving conditions, which will help more reasonable use of thesystem power demand by extending the planning horizon. However, the inaccuracy and uncertainties of prediction informationcould have an important effect on the HESS with battery andsupercapacitor. This paper contributes to a better understandingof the details of the impacts of the inaccuracy and uncertainties ofthe terrain information on battery life and system efficiency basedon two different hybrid energy storage systems with semiactivetopologies, and furthermore, a novel power management strategyis developed to deal with inaccuracy and uncertainties. Theresults of this paper will be useful for a practical implementof an HESS for battery life and system efficiency improvement.
