Radio frequency identification (RFID),as a crucial component of the Internet of things, has been widelydeployed in many industrial applications ranging from logisticsto retail. There are increasing needs for RFID to not only detectwhether the tagged object is within the radio range, but alsolocate the object with high accuracy. Current RFID systemsaddressing these problems are either expensive or complexto implement. The RFID-based localization method presentedin this paper is cost-efficient and computationally inexpensive.We consider using commercial off-the-shelf RFID devices withoutdeployment of the reference tags to locate the target object. Theantenna is mounted on a mobile vehicle to emulate the antennaarray. Due to the fact that the target tag lies on the hyperboliccurve with two antennasâ€™ positions as the foci, this paper suggestsconstructing multiple hyperbolas to determine the target positionbased on the virtual antenna array. The experimental resultsdemonstrate that the proposed approach is feasible and achievesa median accuracy of 12 cm.
