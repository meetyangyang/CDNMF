Motivated by the fact that obtaininguseful mathematical models of hydraulic excavators may beimpractical or too costly, this paper proposes an online learningcontrol technique for the position control of hydraulic excavators.The proposed control technique uses remote control valve (RCV)signals and measurements of the joint angles to learn thedynamics of the excavator in an online manner, and the RCVinputs required to track the desired trajectory are generatedsimultaneously. As a result of online learning, the controllercompensates for the changes in the plant dynamics over time,caused by factors, such as fluid temperature change or componentwear. In this paper, we have implemented and validated theproposed controller on a 21-ton class hydraulic excavator. Theproposed online learning control framework can also be appliedto a wide range of control applications, where a mathematicalmodel of the plant is absent or impractical to obtain.
