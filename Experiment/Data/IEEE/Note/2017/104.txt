This paper was motivated by the problem of coordinating a large number of autonomous robots in collaborative manufacturing and delivery processes, where each robot has an individual task but collaborations among the robots are essential for the accomplishment of all tasks. Existing approaches to address such problems rely on the direct composition of all robotsâ€™ models and tasks, yielding a high complexity of computation and difficulty of coordination, where all robot behaviors are synchronized at all time and coordinated centrally. In this paper, through a local request and reply communication protocol, we remove these constraints and impose only local coordination rules among the robots. Moreover, compared with the common solutions, where interrobot collaborations are bound to preassigned robot identities, we allow the robots to negotiate and choose their collaborators in a flexible way. It is guaranteed that the individual task of each robot is satisfied under the collaboration with other robots, but without the need of  a central coordinator. We have shown that it is particularly useful for loosely coupled multirobot applications, where the interrobot collaborations are feasible and local. Simulation results suggest that this approach is applicable to large-scale multirobot systems and can be easily integrated with suitable low-level motion control strategies, but it has not yet been tested in experimental environments. In the future research, we will address more complex robot tasks and practical implementations.
