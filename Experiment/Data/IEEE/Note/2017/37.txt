In this paper, we present a new ideafor ECO-driving for buses. It is an Internet of Things conceptâ€”that instead of connecting devices in space, connects devices intime via forecasting engines. Basically, a bus uses knowledgeof the available energy at the next charging step, to optimizeits performance beforehand. The system can be implementedusing available (free) forecasting engines, and existing distributedoptimization tools. A sample implementation is described usinga Toyota plug-in Prius (as a proxy for a hybrid bus). Apart fromthe forecasting and optimization analytics, the only additionalwork needed was the development of an interface unit to controlelectric vehicle mode of the vehicle, and the development of asmart-phone app. Future work will investigate the impacts ofour approach on the grid, the integration of the ideas into thehybrid drive cycle, and using driver behavior as an input intothe design of the utility functions.
