This paper presents a methodology foronline state estimation in natural environments using only a camera and a low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)IMU. It focuses on addressing the problems of online estimatorinitialization, sensor extrinsic calibration, and nonlinear optimization with online refinement of calibration parameters. Thispaper is particularly useful for applications that have superior size, weight, and power constraints. It aims for rapid deploymentof robot platforms with robust state estimation capabilities withalmost no setup, calibration, or initialization overhead. Theproposed method can be used in platforms including handhelddevices, aerial robots, and other small-scale mobile platforms,with applications in monitoring, inspection, and search andrescue.
