Faults in heating;  ventilation;  and air conditioning air handling units (AHU) may cause high energy consumption and discomfort to occupants. Fault diagnosis in AHU is challenging since: 1) effects of faults propagate across components connected by airflows and 2) measurement noises may cause high false alarm rates. In this paper;  a novel fault diagnosis method is established to identify failure modes and fault severities. This method explicitly considers the fault coupling among components. To reduce false alarm rates;  new statistical process control techniques are developed to filter out false alarms. Experimental results show that our method can effectively diagnose faults with high diagnosis accuracy.
