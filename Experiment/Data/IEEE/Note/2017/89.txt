In theory, to maximize the number of read RFID tags in ALOHA-based systems (i.e., throughput) one has to adapt the size of the communication frame according to the number of tags that are communicating with the reader. The research community has already invested considerable effort on techniques that estimate the unknown number of tags, and thus maximize throughput. In this paper, we demonstrate that research efforts should rather be moved to a deeper modeling of the physical effects that are disrupting system behavior.
