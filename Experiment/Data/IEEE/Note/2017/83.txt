This paper is motivated by the problem of fault diagnosis of complex electronic systems in the presence of transient fault (TF) and intermittent fault (IF). Existing approaches do not involve the dynamic behavior of electronic systems, i.e., degradation and aging. The results of fault diagnosis could be different at different times for the given identical fault symptoms because of the degradation and aging. This paper suggests a new fault diagnosis approach using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). It aims at identifying the component faults and distinguishing the fault types, i.e., TF, IF, and permanent faults. We construct the DBN structure and parameter models and define two judgment rules to determine the fault diagnosis results. The future scope of work can be directed toward the development of a practice fault diagnosis system for an electronic system to validate the proposed methodology.
