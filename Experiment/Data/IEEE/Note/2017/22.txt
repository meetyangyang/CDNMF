This paper was motivated by the problem of coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) in orderto increase the reliability and efficiency of distribution systems.Existing approaches are centralized, where a single control centergathers information from and provides control signals to theentire system. This centralized control framework may be subjected to performance limitations, such as high communicationrequirement and cost, substantial computational burden, limitedflexibility, and disrespect of privacy. To overcome these limitationsand accommodate various resources in the future smart grid, inthis paper, we develop an alternative distributed control strategy,where each DER communicates only with its neighbors, withouta need for a central coordinator. In this paper, only distributedgenerators and energy storage devices are considered. In futureresearch, we will extend the proposed algorithms to include othertypes of flexible resources, such as thermostatically controlledloads, plug-in electric vehicles, and deferrable loads.
