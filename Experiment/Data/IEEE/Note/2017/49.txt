Large-range compliant gripper is attractive in microassembly for grasping objects with a wide range ofsizes. This paper reports on the design of such a compliant gripperwhich is able to execute pick-and-place operation of objectsranging between 0.15 and 4 mm. One gripper arm is driven toprovide a bidirectional gripping motion, whose position is sensedby a metal strain gauge. To meet the requirement of force sensingfor grasping different sized objects, a dual-sensitivity, dual-rangeforce sensor is devised for the other arm of the gripper. It isresponsible for measuring the grasp forces of smaller and largerobjects in the two measuring ranges, respectively. In additionto the grasp force sensing, the force sensor is able to detect thein-plane and out-of-plane interaction forces in perpendicular axes.Such capability is useful to determine the exact moment whena contact is made between the gripper tip and the environment,so as to secure the operation in microassembly applications.The performance of the developed gripper prototype is verifiedthrough extensive experimental studies. Moreover, an automatedpick-transport-place operation of a small screw is conducted to demonstrate the gripper capability in automated assemblyapplication.
