We encounter nonrepetitive cleaningtasks everyday in both industrial and household environments.Variations in stain pattern, geometry, and material of the objectmake it difficult to manually program robots for such tasks.In this paper, we present planning algorithms to automatethe cleaning task using robots. The practical impact of ourapproach is evidenced by the actual robot results involvingrealistic examples like cleaning of hard paint stains on curvedsurfaces and rust on metal surfaces. Practitioners from industrycan use the methods presented in this paper to develop automated robotic systems for nonrepetitive tasks like cleaning andpolishing. Our approach caters to the primary requirements ofthese applications like multiple setups, multiple passes withineach setup, and determination of optimal motion parameters likevelocity, force, and oscillation frequency of the cleaning tool.
