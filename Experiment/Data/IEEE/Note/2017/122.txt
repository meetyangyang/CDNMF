Motivated by the specific needs found by a drug distributor in managing deliveries to pharmacies involved in its supply chain, this paper considers an optimization problem as the proper way to model the particularities found in this scenario. This paper proposes the use of a combinatorial optimization problem as the way to model problems. Due to the fact that distributorâ€™s clients are located in different cities, the proposal considers travel times both between cities and inside the city. In addition, rush hours are also taken into account, in order to provide a more realistic model. Finally, a radio frequency identification-based solution is proposed, in order to implement traceability in the delivered products, as well as to prevent human errors. Additionally, in case an unavoidable error occurs, the solution offers also an incident management mechanism.
