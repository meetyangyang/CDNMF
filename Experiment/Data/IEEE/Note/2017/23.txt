This paper aims to obtain a satisfactoryPQ level while minimizing the total branch active power lossesin the day-ahead dispatch of active distribution networks, sinceinverters-based BES and DG can inject harmonic pollutioninto distribution networks and voltage unbalance level is alsoan important issue for supplying good quality electricity toend users. To achieve such an objective, PQ constraints suchas the total voltage harmonic distortion (THD) constraints,the individual voltage distortion constraints, and the voltageunbalance factor constraints are considered into the day-aheadscheduling. In addition, the network active power losses of theconcerned harmonic frequencies are also considered into theobjective function. The simulation results of the unbalancedIEEE 13-bus, IEEE 37-bus, and IEEE 123-bus systems showthat the proposed approach can give a satisfactory day-ahead schedule of good quality power for active distribution networks.Also, the case studies indicate that total network power lossesand the satisfactory PQ are the two contradictory objectives.The proposed approach can be applied to ensure a satisfactoryPQ when making a dispatch plan in distribution networks withinverter-based BES and DG.
