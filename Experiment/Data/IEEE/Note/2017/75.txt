A soft robotic sorting table has acomputer-controlled soft surface that can move delicate objectswithout damaging them. There are currently no closed-loopcontrol systems for such robots, because it is unclear how torelate the control signals to the behavior of the table, or whichactions to choose in order to solve a manipulation task. In thispaper, we propose a probabilistic automaton to plan the bestaction sequence on average. The sequence brings the workpieceson top of a soft table into a desired condition. It is a machinelearning solution that is based on observations of the input signalsand their effect, rather than a detailed analytical or numericalmodeling of the robot. We show that it is feasible to model anexisting soft robotic table. We demonstrate that the planning issuccessful by solving complex maze tasks. Our results are basedon experiments and simulations.
