This paper was motivated by the problem of how to determine the optimal pitch in a patterned nanowire growth process to reduce resource competition between nanowires during the growth process. Existing approaches generally deal with such problems through experiments, and most of them neglect the impact of competition on the growth yield. This paper proposes a physical-statistical approach to model the interaction between nanowires during growth and determine the optimal pitch. It should be noted that in some applications specific density or other requirements must be satisfied.
