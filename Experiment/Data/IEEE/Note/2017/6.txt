This paper is focused on developingmobile microgrids using autonomous vehicles. An autonomousmobile microgrid can be used to establish microgrids in anarea without human intervention or it can be used to achieveenergy autonomy for robots. Energy autonomy allows robotsperform missions that extend beyond their battery life andhelps robots to recharge themselves as they enter a low batterystate. The structure of a mobile microgrid heavily relies on twodisciplines of robotics and power electrics and can further benefitfrom communication, optimization, and controls theories. Thispaper discusses and suggests development directions for differentdisciplines involved to ease the integration process. Also, theefforts are aimed to improve the overall performance of themobile microgrid system while keeping limitations and potentialsof each discipline in consideration.
