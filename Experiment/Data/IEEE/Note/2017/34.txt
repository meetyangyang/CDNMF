This paper is motivated and supportedby a smart gas grid project of the Energy Delta Gas Research(EDGaR) consortium in the Netherlands. The project deals withinvestigating the capacity of smart grid technologies to facilitatethe introduction of new gases into the distribution grids, withdiverse gas qualities and multiple injection points. The gasdistribution grid will have to move from a passive to an activedistribution system that dynamically control bidirectional flowsbetween end users and the grid operators. As the end users maybe equipped with energy converters, other energy distributiongrids also need to transform into active distribution systems.Existing approaches are distributed, where each end user andenergy grid operator can locally solve their optimal controlproblem. In this paper, we consider the fact that both end usersand grid operators do not have access to a common clock whensolving their problem and when sharing their information. Theinformation includes some of their states and controllable inputs.The asynchronous information exchange problem was pointedout by DNV GL Netherlands, Gasunie, and Gasterra, which arecompanies we collaborate with within the EDGaR consortium.
