The motivation of this paper is to design a DSS to be used by logistics decision makers in the new paradigm of cooperative logistics for intermodal transportation systems. The DSS provides to the logistics practitioners the help to take decisions with two main features: the cooperative approach among the different involved stakeholders and the cloud architecture allowing a modular plug and play structure. Based on modern information and communications technology tools, suitable applications can be developed with the aim of planning, coordinating and synchronizing logistic activities as well as effectively reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Future research will specify in detail other DSS decision modules that can provide decisions to stakeholders in different intermodal transportation systems, for instance involving trains or planes. Moreover, the decision-making process could include real-time information about weather forecasts and emergency issues.
