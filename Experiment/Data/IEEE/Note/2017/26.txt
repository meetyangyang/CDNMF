One of the obstacles for large scaledeployment of wind generation is the challenges it imposes on theefficient operation of the electricity system. This paper presentsa full stochastic scheduling model. The long-term uncertaintydriven by wind forecasting errors and the short-term uncertaintydriven by generation outages are modeled by using scenario treeand capacity outage probability table, respectively. The modelleads to significant operation cost saving within reasonablecomputational time. The proposed model could be applied in reallarge-scale power systems to support the cost-effective integrationof wind generation.
