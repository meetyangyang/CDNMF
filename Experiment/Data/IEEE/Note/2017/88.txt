This paper aims to solve the problem of task scheduling for a private cloud in hybrid clouds. The aperiodicity of arrival tasks brings a challenge of maximizing the profit of a private cloud provider while guaranteeing the service delay bound of delay-tolerant tasks. Existing methods usually provide an admission control to refuse some of arrival tasks that exceed the capacity of a private cloud. This paper first proposes an architecture of temporal task scheduling in hybrid clouds. Based on the architecture, a PMA algorithm is proposed to provide temporal task scheduling which can maximize the profit of a private cloud by intelligently dispatching arrival tasks to execute in private and public clouds within the service delay bound. Preliminary simulation experiments show that the proposed temporal task scheduling is feasible but it has not yet been implemented in real hybrid clouds. In future research, we will extend this work to incorporate multiple different tasks that require heterogeneous resources including bandwidth and storage.
