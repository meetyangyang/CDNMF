Digital control systems are widely usedfor safety-critical systems today, and for such a system, the reliability has become an important topic. It is a difficult issue due toits complexity, time-dependence, and degradation. The proposedframework in this paper enables dynamic reliability modeling andstatistical analysis for digital control systems subject to networkeddegradations. The novelty of this paper is the modeling and analysis that link the control system and reliability engineering. Thecontrol systems are regarded as failures determined by whetherthe performances satisfy all operational requirements and the reliability concerns the ability of system or component to perform itsrequired functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Therefore, the reliability of the digital networked control systems can be defined as the ability of the control systems to maintainoperational requirements in the presence of networked degradations. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to quantitatively assesssuch ability. Case study shows that this framework is applicable inhelping the designers fully understand the systems and make decisions.
