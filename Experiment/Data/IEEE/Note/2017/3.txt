Most classical automation tasks takeplace in structured environments, such as factories and warehouses. Such environments can be mapped in advance. Themaps in turn allow for the offline planning of trajectories.Mapping the environment in advance for automation tasks thattake place in large outdoor environments can be challenging.Online exploration based on sensor feedback becomes necessary.In this paper, we study exploration problems for two subtasksof a habitat monitoring application. The first task is navigationaround unknown obstacles. The second task is the explorationof shadow-casting obstacles for solar harvesting. For both problems, we present motion strategies with provable performanceguarantees. Combined, these algorithms advance the state-ofthe-art toward the goal of monitoring tracking wildlife and otherdynamic phenomena with autonomous surface vehicles.
