The characterization of elastic and viscoelastic properties of micrometer-sized soft materials is of great significance in many disciplines, such as biomaterials, pharmaceutics, and cell mechanics. Among various material characterization techniques, methods based on MEMS devices are well recognized for their high resolution, perfect size matching to microscale objects, and excellent cost-effectiveness. However, existing MEMS-based approaches are limited to one-axis (tensile or compression) testing, and cannot measure both compressive and shear properties of soft materials. This paper reports a force-controlled MEMS microgripper with two-axis actuation and force sensing capabilities for elastic and viscoelastic testing of polymeric microstructures in both the compressive and shear directions. The platform can facilitate various synthesis and/or characterization studies of microscale soft materials.
