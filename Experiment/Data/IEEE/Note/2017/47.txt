This paper was motivated by the problemof the adhesion effects on the control of objects at the microscale.The micro-objects behave differently in ambient environmentsand in liquids. In ambient environments the micro-objects canreach high velocities since the viscous forces are negligible, however the adhesion forces limit the repeatability of the motion. Inliquid medium, the issues of the adhesion effect decrease, but thevelocity is limited due to the viscous forces. This paper suggestsa noncontact approach where micro-objects are placed at theairâ€“liquid interface and are controlled by magnetic forces. In thispaper, we have demonstrated, by using a closed-loop control, a high speed and precise actuation of micro-objects along one axis(1-D). The position error of an object of 60 50 25 m is lessthan 10% of its size and the maximum velocity reached is about 6mm/s. In addition, objects smaller than 50 m can be controlled(the position error of an object of 30 20 25 m is less than7% of its size). This approach avoids the issues of the adhesioneffects and represents a promising solution for high speed transportation and precise positioning of objects. In future research, astrategy of control will be developed for high speed/precise controlof objects in 2-D. These developments will directly contribute tothe design of magnetic smart surfaces at micrometer scale that willconvey microcomponents. It represents a key element of futureassembly lines at micrometer scale.
