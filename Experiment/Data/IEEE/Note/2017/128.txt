How to place a polygon on an isometric grid in order to contain the maximum number of grid cells in its interior is a problem that is encountered in several applications, such as packing problem and shape-matching. In this paper, we show that computing the optimal placement of a polygon upon a given grid can be done in polynomial time. We also provide an improved and more efficient algorithm for the problem. We implement the algorithm using MATLAB and verify its efficiency with an example.
