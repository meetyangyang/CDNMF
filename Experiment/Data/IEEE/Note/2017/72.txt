In this paper, a hydraulic mini excavatoris considered for demonstrating the benefits of automationwith regard to the development of advanced mobile machinery.A detailed physical model and a simplified model are introducedfor virtual analysis and comissioning of the excavator. This allowsfor detailed system analysis even at an early development stage.Then, a framework for automated testing of the real prototype isintroduced. This concept is based on attitude estimation filters,a state machine, and model predictive controllers and closelyresembles the human driver in its behavior, but allows forreproducible testing results and therefore reduces commissioningefforts and development costs. Particular attention is paid tothe robustness of the control concept, since the coupling of thehydraulic axes and digging forces lead to disturbances that needto be compensated. A simple, yet efficient and real-time capablealgorithm is provided for numerical optimization. Experimentalresults show that the developed methods can contribute to theautomation of hydraulic machinery, and that the introducedframework can easily be extended in order to automate othertypes of machinery with simple hydraulics.
