This paper seeks to solve the problem of minimizing the medical staff cost constrained by certain service requirements [i.e.;  patients' waiting times for treatment] at an emergency department in Hong Kong. In our formulation;  these service requirements are characterized by some stochastic constraints. Most of the existing random search methods concentrate on the computing efforts in the neighborhood of the best-so-far solutions in order to obtain good-quality solutions. Due to the special structure of this problem and ease of computing the objective values;  we proposed an efficient random search approach that iteratively identifies a solution with a better objective value than that of the current best solution. Experimental studies demonstrate the significantly higher efficiency of this method. In order to obtain the same solution quality;  it is able to reduce the computational time by 90% compared with some existing approaches in the literature.
