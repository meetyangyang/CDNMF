We propose a control strategy thataims to minimize the imbalance between forecasted and actualsupply and demand in electricity grids. This is important,because the imbalance can lead to commercial losses for thestakeholders. Since the number of agents (i.e., households) in thepower network is typically large, centralized controllers are notfeasible due to scalability issues. We instead develop a distributedcontroller that solves the problem using only local information.We demonstrate our algorithm through simulations, which areimplemented on a single computer. In practice, households canhave smart meters on which the individual controllers run,thereby obtaining the solution in a parallel fashion.
