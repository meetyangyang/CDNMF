This investigation presents a modelpredictive controller for optimizing the operations of a districtheating power plant (DHPP). The formulation includes theflexible loads, thermal energy storage, and other operationalconstraints, such as power plant layout, that were not consideredin the existing literature. In addition, constraints on supply watertemperature and reliability are included in the formulation. Theproposed approach combines demand forecast with the optimization model and solves it using a receding horizon approachto enhance the robustness to forecast errors. The method isillustrated in a DHPP in Yilvieska, Finland, that supports ourclaims.
