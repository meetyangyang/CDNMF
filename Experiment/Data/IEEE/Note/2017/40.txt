This paper is motivated by the needfor improving the accuracy and reliability of remaining servicelife prediction of critical components in the heating, ventilation,and air conditioning (HVAC) system. A set of indicators, suchas heat transfer efficiency and subcooling degree, are firstestablished from sensor measurement to characterize the healthstate of heat exchangers in the HVAC system. These indicatorsare normalized with respect to control policies under normaloperating conditions, to serve as a reference base. As newindicators become available from future usage, they are comparedwith the reference values, and the differences (i.e., residuals)are used to indicate variations in the health state of the heatexchangers. Faults are detected and characterized by variationsof these residuals. As an example, fault due to refrigerantleakage will reduce the heat transfer efficiency and subcoolingdegree, whereas fault due to reduced water flow will increasethese two indicators. Performance tracking when the rate ofdegradation is time varying or when fault occurs abruptly isrealized by tracking the variation of these residuals through the integrated stochastic filtering method. Simulation using a finiteelement model of a shell-tube heat exchanger and experimentalstudy using data provided by the American Society of Heating,Refrigeration, and AC Engineering confirmed the effectiveness ofthe developed technique. The technique can be applied to otherHVAC components or dynamical systems (such as manufacturingmachines, transportation, or traffic control) where trending ofcomplex gradual and abrupt changes is required.
