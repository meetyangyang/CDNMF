This paper was motivated by the currentdeficiency in the automatic generation of five-axis continuousinspection paths for free-form surfaces. Existing automaticinspection path planning algorithms are mainly designed forthe traditional three-axis and three + two-axis point-by-pointinspection process, which is time-consuming and unable tobe utilized for the much more efficient five-axis continuousinspection because of the drastically different working patternsbetween them. We present a novel five-axis inspection pathgeneration algorithm that strives to take full advantages of theunique characteristics and the working capacities of the fiveaxis inspection machine, where an inspection path is defined bya trajectory curve of the probe head and the correspondingsweep curve of the stylus tip. Starting with a near-optimumpartitioning of the surface, we carefully design oscillating patternsfor the sweep curve, while at the same time, try to shorten andsmooth the trajectory curve as much as possible, with the giveninspection sample accuracy always upheld. A five-axis inspectionpath thus generated will, in general, match the kinematical loads on the stylus and the probe head with their respective kinematiccapacities (i.e., the limit on the speed and the acceleration of anaxis). As a direct result of this design, the five-axis inspectionmachine is able to work under the maximum or near-maximumworking capacity of every axis, thus tremendously shortening thetotal inspection time, often 20â€“30 times as compared with a pathgenerated by a traditional method, such as the isoplanar method.Our algorithm is particularly suitable for the five-axis continuousinspection of large free-form parts, such as those in automobileand aerospace industry. Currently, our method is a suboptimalsolution, since the surface partitioning is required to start fromthe boundary of the surface. In the future, we will try to relaxthis requirement and further increase the inspection efficiency.
