In this paper, we propose a scalablesolution for supporting distributed load control in a community of smart buildings, whose deployment requires minimalcommunication overhead and no dedicated investments for thecontrol network. The control system, called Overgrid, is implemented over an unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay basedon gossiping, a commonly used paradigm allowing a strongand scalable information diffusion (fault tolerant) across thenetwork, totally decentralized, and with low network overhead.Overgrid creates the P2P network over the electrical grid (thusthe name Overgrid), in which the management of electrical loadsis carried out by the nodes participating in the network throughinnovative distributed algorithms. We exploit a one-year studyof power consumption traces in a reference industrial site andsimulation-based traces for residential buildings, in order to testthe effectiveness of our solution in realistic scenarios.
