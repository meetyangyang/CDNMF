The practitioners can use the methodspresented in this paper to solve the following two problems: 1) toestimate the allowable delay that a control system can tolerateand 2) to design the globally optimal PID controller in terms ofthe delay range. This paper was motivated by how to find theglobally optimal PID parameters in the presence of uncertaindelays. Conventionally, the uncertain delay is dealt with linearmatrix inequalities (LMIs). However, the results based on solvingLMIs are not globally optimal. Here, we dealt with the uncertaindelay in the frequency domain. We not only proposed a method tocompute the maximum delay that the classical PID controller cantolerate but also find all the admissible PID controllers stabilizinga processes in the presence of uncertain delay. To obtain theglobally optimal controller for a given process, the boundariesfor the norm-based indices were constructed. Then, theglobally optimal PID controller satisfying multiple objectives canbe easily found in the admissible region. The examples clearlyshowed that the method based on LMI only provided one localoptimal solution. However, the proposed method can find all of theadmissible solutions and select the optimal one. We also discussedthe application of the well-known MIGO method in the case ofuncertain delays. Also, the rules of selecting the robustness index in terms of uncertain delay were proposed. The above methodswere proposed based on first-order plus time delay models sincemost chemical processes can be modeled by this type of model.Certainly the methods can be extended to high order processeswith uncertain delays. But the methods may not easily be used formultiple-input-multiple-output processes since it is difficult to construct the stability regions of the parameters for such processes.Also, the method cannot be used to deal with the random delays.
