Three-dimensional sensing and scanning devices are widely used to capture digital surfaces of real objects and scenes in many scenarios. However, due to occlusion, motion, multiple reflections, and so on, the captured data often suffer from severe contamination with noise, significantly hindering its practical applications. Therefore, it is indispensable to remove noise prior to further processing, which is commonly referred to as mesh denoising. Mesh denoising is a long-standing problem, and remains open in academic as well as industrial applications due to its challenging nature. The state-of-the-art methods either fail to retain most of the original features presented well in the object, or cannot avoid additional artifacts, such as vertex drifts. In contrast, we design a denoising framework aiming at improving the quality of the raw surface by producing a mesh with better perceptual features. The technique developed here can produce high-quality surface data of real objects and scenes, which would facilitate the modeling, reconstruction, and recognition applications in computer-aided design, reverse engineering, 3-D printing, and computer-aided manufacturing.
