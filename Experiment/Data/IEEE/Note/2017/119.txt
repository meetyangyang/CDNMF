Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the new technology that is believed to remarkably change the logistics and supply chain management for a company. According to some pioneers’ practice, the reduced inventory inaccuracy and the reduced demand distortion are the main benefits of RFID. With these benefits, the satisfied demand or sale will be enlarged, which further requires the redesign of a company’s supply chain network. This paper establishes a supply chain network design model to determine the influence area and order quantity of each regional distribution center (RDC). We give a two-phase approximation method to simplify the problem and derive the closed form solutions of the problem. We show that when RFID is used, the influence area of each RDC decreases and the order quantity increases. The influence of RFID on influence area and order quantity is positively related to RFID’s demand increasing effect. That is, if the supply chain is suffering the inventory inaccuracy and demand distortion, the RFID has more influences on the supply chain network.
