 Scheduling and modeling of robotic cells are absolutely essential for manufacturers who seek methods to increase the productivity of their robotized production systems. The maximum improvement in productivity level of cells is also of interest to leading robotic cell designers. This improvement can be even more significant for cells which use advanced robots such as multifunction ones. In more detail, multifunction robotic cells are extensively used in the inspection of many automotive products including crankshaft, gears and lifters in transit. Here, some practice scheduling problems addressing multifunction robots with stop resume processing modes are identified, and then the optimality conditions are determined for these problems. Using the results in this paper, production managers are able to develop a methodology for scheduling of multifunction robotic cells bought by their companies.
