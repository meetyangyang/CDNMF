Additive manufacturing (AM) hasthe characteristics of extremely high product varieties andlow product volumes. Achieving high and consistent geometricaccuracy in AM is therefore a daunting task because newproducts may not have been tried before, especially for thefabrication products with complex arbitrary shapes. This paperpresents a novel prescriptive methodology to predict and controlproduct in-plane geometric errors based on a limited numberof trial cases. Successful experimental validation indicates theprospect of direct digital manufacturing of arbitrary freeformproducts with improved precision.
