This paper aims at addressing thechallenges of performing prognostics when multiple sensors aresimultaneously monitoring the health status of a degraded unit.Specifically, the paper starts from proposing a new SNR metricthat numerically measures the signal quality of a degradationsignal. Then, a novel data fusion methodology that combines theinformation from multiple degradation signals is developed toconstruct a composite health index with the goal of maximizing theproposed SNR metric. The developed method is greatly beneficialwhen the degraded unit results from a single failure mode andoperates under a single environmental condition. There are several steps involved when implementing the method: 1) collectingthe historical degradation signals from multiple sensors; 2) characterizing the degradation patterns of these signals; 3) derivingthe optimal weights with the goal of maximizing the proposedSNR metric by using the eigendecomposition approach; and 4)constructing the health index that combines multiple sensor databased on the derived optimal weights.
