The quality of an assembled productdepends highly on the quality attributes of its component parts.For example, in battery manufacturing, the durability andconductance of bonds between the battery cells are criticallydetermined by the dimension of the battery cells, where thedimensional variation is essentially one of the major sources ofquality defects. In these cases, selective assembly could be utilizedto achieve high-precision assembly even with low-precision parts.In addition, the idea of employing selective assembly to maximizethe benefits can also be introduced to remanufacturing systemswhere the incoming parts exhibit various quality grades. Matching components with similar grades will potentially reduce wasteand lead to greater monetary benefits. Most selective assemblystudies assume reliable machines and infinite buffers. However,this may not be the case for many assembly systems. Therefore,in this paper, a two-level decomposition method is introducedto efficiently analyze selective assembly systems with unreliablemachines and finite buffers. Such a method provides a generictool to investigate the efficacy and efficiency of selective assemblysystems.
