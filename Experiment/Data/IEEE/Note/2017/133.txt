This paper attempted to tackle an issue derived from data-based decentralized process monitoring of industrial processes. In this paper, we proposed a modified multiblock PCA (MBPCA) algorithm for developing decentralized monitoring models, and integrate them with Bayesian inference to get unique probabilistic monitoring index for fault detection. The presented decentralized monitoring scheme provides a way to model the large-scale process data with the consideration of the specificity in individual block as well as the relevance among different blocks, which is partially ignored by most of the purely data-based decentralized monitoring methods. Furthermore, the comparison studies demonstrated that the proposed method is highly competitive for monitoring large-scale processes.
