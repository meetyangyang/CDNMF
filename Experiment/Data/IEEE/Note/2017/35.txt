In a microgrid, e.g., for a school campusor a residential community, a set of distributed energy devicesgenerate and store different types of energy such as electricityand steam to meet time-varying electricity and thermal demand.They should be coordinated through daily operation to reduceenergy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a novelmodel is established for operation to reduce daily energy andCO2 emission costs. By solving the problem, optimized operationstrategies are obtained. To consider capital and maintenancecosts in the long run, microgrid design is also critical. Toevaluate the lifetime cost including the reliability cost and theclassic components such as capital and fuel costs, a linear modelis established. By exhaustively searching through the limitednumber of selected combinations of device sizes, the optimizeddesign is found. The results show that the total energy andemission cost is reduced by the optimized operation compared with the selected heuristic operation, and microgrids have lowerlifetime costs than conventional energy systems. Implications forregulators and distribution utilities are also discussed.
