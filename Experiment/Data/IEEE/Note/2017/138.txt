Simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems and evaluating decision problems, since real-world systems usually do not satisfy the analytical models and thus are difficult to be evaluated. Simulation makes it possible to accurately simulate a system through the use of logically complex, and often nonmathematical models. Detailed dynamics of complex, stochastic systems can therefore be modeled. However, simulation efficiency is still a major concern for practitioners due to the computational expense of conducting simulation experiments and the slow convergence of performance. In this study, we propose a new budget allocation framework to improve the efficiency of simulation optimization algorithms. Given a fixed amount of computing budget, it specifies the size of solutions to collect and the number of simulation replications to run for each solution by balancing the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. It can be shown through numerical experiments that for the production line optimization and the assemble-to-order problem, two common simulation optimization problems in practice, the computing efforts can be reduced by approximately 25%â€“60% by incorporating the new budget allocation method.
