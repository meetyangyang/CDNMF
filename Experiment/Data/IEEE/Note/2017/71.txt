/i>\nâ€”The reduced filters and plans explored in this paper are of practical interest in several contexts;  including: 1) on robot platforms with severely limited computational power; 2) communication over low-bandwidth noisy channels; 3) a special instance of the previous case includes human-robot interaction settings where interfaces constrain information transfer; and 4) understanding the size and the structure of concise plans or filters for given problems provides insights into those problems (e.g.;  to assess the value of a particular sensor by comparing the size of filters with or without it.).
