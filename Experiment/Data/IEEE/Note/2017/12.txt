The majority of existing maintenancestrategies focus on fixed system structures, which scarcelyconsider changeable system structures derived from operationprocess rebuilding (OPR). Thus, this paper, which is motivatedby this problem, attempts to satisfy flexible needs in a keenlycompetitive market. This paper proposes a bilevel maintenancemethodology that is integrated with OPR to achieve costeffective and fast-responding system-level maintenance optimizations. Implementation of the proposed methodology involves thefollowing basic steps: 1) collect individual machine conditiondata; 2) prepare machine-level maintenance schedules accordingto a multiobjective model (maintenance cost rate, machineavailability, and operation profit rate); and 3) utilize a variablemaintenance time window to optimize system-level maintenanceaccording to OPR activities. The bilevel methodology can beeasily modified according to practical requirements, i.e., otherdecision-making objectives at the machine level and the maintenance time window range at the system level.
