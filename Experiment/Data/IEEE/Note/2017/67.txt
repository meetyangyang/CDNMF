Due to the larger wafer size and circuitwidth reduction, cluster tools often perform the lot switchingoperation with each pair of consecutive wafer lots. In addition,since most tools are operated with parallel chambers, concurrentprocessing with two different wafer lots occurs frequently. Suchtransient periods in operating tools make it hard to estimate thecompletion time of wafer lots. In this paper, we derive closedform expressions to obtain the completion time of wafer lots insingle-armed cluster tools with parallel chambers. We furthershow that the formulas can be used with processing timevariation or the FIFO rule. With the formulas, OHTs can besent just-in-time to tools to load or unload wafer cassettes, andwafer lots can be assigned while minimizing the transient periods.In addition, the estimated completion time can be utilized in theplanning and scheduling of wafer fabrication processes.
