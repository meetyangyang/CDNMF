The designers of a mobile RFID system where the moving tags pass the readerâ€™s interrogation region with constant speed have a challenging task for selecting the appropriate parameters. The parameters will be selected in such a way that the system will work most efficiently or the moving tags will be unidentified with minimum probability. The optimum number of frames plays an important role in the design of an efficient mobile RFID system and the computation of this parameter and the relationship with other related parameters have been presented in this paper. The efficiency of a mobile RFID system can be drastically reduced in the presence of random DoS attacking signals. We have presented the computation methods and results of the optimum number of frames in a mobile RFID system with and without the presence of random DoS attacking signals.
