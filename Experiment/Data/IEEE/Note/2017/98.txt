The strategic decision-making issues in flexible production system management are critical. Questions facing plant or enterprise teams are how manufacturers should plan and evaluate their system flexibility profiles in order to wisely invest in and upgrade their flexible equipment. Or which factory out of many they should choose from to launch a new product given different flexibilities of the plants. In order to answer these questions, we study production system flexibility measures in terms of matching production capacities and demands. Accurate estimates of demand shortfall and the service level are obtained. The results lead to measurements on how much demand shortfall a manufacturer generates when confronting its demand and production uncertainty. By taking advantage of such metrics, one can compare distinct improvement plans. To further understand such measurement, sensitivity analyses of service level with respect to reductions in setup time, downtime, and cycle time are carried out, and the impact of new product launch and product correlation on system flexibility is investigated. The results can be used to guide strategic system flexibility planning.
