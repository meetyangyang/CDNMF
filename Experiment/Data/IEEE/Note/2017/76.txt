 The (min,+) linear system theory usedin this paper aims at obtaining linear models for a subclass ofman-designed systems, such as automated manufacturing systemsor traffic networks. This theory has many analogies with theconventional linear system theory (for continuous systems) andit provides the basis to develop a specific control theory forman-made systems. More precisely, the theory of (min,+) linearsystems is well suited to systems where the prevailing phenomenaare synchronizations, delays, duplications, and batches. Thesephenomena arise, for example, in operations such as assembly/matching, cutting/lot splitting, and palletization/lot making.Among the possible representations, we can describe these systems by transfer functions obtained by the combination of a finitenumber of basic operators. This is analogous to block diagram inthe conventional system theory, i.e., a transfer function describesthe complete inputâ€“output behavior of a system. In the context ofmanufacturing systems, a transfer function describes the way a system maps an input flow of materials (raw part inputs) into anoutput flow (finished parts), without the necessity of simulationtools to predict this. Moreover, the transfer function thus obtainedcan be used to compute controllers in order to regulate theinternal flows of a system, for instance to decrease internal stocks.In the case of an automated system, the obtained controllerscan be implemented on a programmable logic controller assupplementary code. This paper focuses on the use of thesealgebraic tools in the model process of manufacturing systemsand, in particular, on their ability to describe splitting andmerging flows of materials.
