Automated electroplating lines are typical integrated and automated manufacturing systems consisting of processing machines and material handling devices. Automated electroplating lines are usually used for printed circuit boards (PCBs) production. The main challenge is to develop approaches to improve the throughput of the line. Since hoists are commonly the bottle neck resource in a line, multiple hoist are often used to balance the line. The improvement of the throughput can be achieved by scheduling hoist operations in lines better. This paper considers multi-degree cycles to improve the throughput comparing to simple cycles. The hoist assignment principle without overlapping is used to avoid conflicts among hoists. A mixed integer linear programming model is formulated to obtain optimal schedules. A number of randomly generated examples are tested by solving instances of the model using the commercial software ILOG CPLEX. Results show the benefits of multi-degree cycles.
