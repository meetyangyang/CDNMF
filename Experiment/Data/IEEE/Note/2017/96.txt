Large oilfields are evolving in time and space due to reservoir state dynamics, varying operating conditions, and new infrastructure. The advance of sensing and control technologies has enabled the automation of such systems; however, the effective use of these technologies rests on the optimization of the production system. To empower engineers to reach optimal operating decisions, this paper developed a methodology consisting of models and strategies for systemwide optimization. The methodology relies on the synthesis of piecewise-linear proxy models for production units and the underlying nonlinear phenomena, to obtain a formulation that is manageable, scalable, and robust for production optimization.
