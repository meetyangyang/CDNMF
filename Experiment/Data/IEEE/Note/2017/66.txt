Emerging sensing and information technologies have provided unprecedented functional data collectioncapacity from systems over time. It is important and challengingto model the relationships among these variables. Among manydifferent modeling alternatives, graphical models are powerfultools to characterize the underlying relationships among variablesin systems. However, traditional graphical models cannot directlymodel a system with a mixture of functional and scalar variables.The proposed model aims to address this challenge by proposinga functional graphical model. Based on simulation studies anda case study for a plasma spray manufacturing process, it isshown that the proposed method performs well under variousconditions.
