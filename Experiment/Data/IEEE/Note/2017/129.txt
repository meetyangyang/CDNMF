This paper is motivated by the optimization of manufacturing systems such as assembly lines and job-shops. The quantity of products which have to be stored or moved and the number and type of machines which operate the system have economical consequences. Therefore, the main problem for designers is to find a tradeoff between minimizing the cost of the resources and maximizing the systemâ€™s throughput. To this end, we formalize and address two problems. First, we aim to minimize the use of resources required to meet a desired throughput. Second, we aim to maximize the throughput with a given set of available resources. However, the existing results fail to provide practically effective and computationally efficient methods to analyze and solve the problems in such systems. The proposed iterative heuristic algorithms can find a proper schedule for a system, which is significant and useful to manufacturing engineers.
