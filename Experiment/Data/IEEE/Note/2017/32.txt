This paper proposes a method to controlthe nodal voltages and the frequency of a microgrid (MG) inislanded operation. The implementation of this control schemerequires defining a control logic for the inverters connecting thedistributed generation units to the MG. A centralized supervisingsystem has also to be deployed for the coordination of theiractions. This paper shows how the flexibility of this structureallows for the implementation of different resource managementstrategies.
