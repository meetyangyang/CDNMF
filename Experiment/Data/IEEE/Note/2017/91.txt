Finding a proper base position is pivotal for achieving automatic offline planning for a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform. We present an algorithm that leads to an appropriate base position for the manipulator by which the manipulator could reach all the target points with specific orientations and keep a stable velocity of the end effector. This will greatly facilitate the offline planning for mobile manipulator systems such as the painting system implemented in this paper. With no need to manually participate in the algorithm implementation;  operators can simply import the path-point data and obtain the optimized base position. The experimental results presented in this paper are encouraging in that the velocity of the end effector is more stable and the planning efficiency is highly increased.
