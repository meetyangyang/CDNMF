Heating and cooling systems for buildings present difficult energy management problems due to theinteraction of complex devices, such as chillers and thermal storages, and the dependence on uncertain variables, such as buildingoccupancy and external temperature. This paper addresses theminimization of the energy consumption in a building endowedwith a cooling system and exploiting a thermal storage unit(essentially a tank storing cool water) to drive the cooling systemmore efficiently. A further degree of freedom is introduced in the optimization process, related to a limited relaxation of theuser comfort request. The methodology explained in this paper isextendable to more complex microgrids, including, e.g., additionalelectric appliances, renewable energy sources, or cogenerationunits.
