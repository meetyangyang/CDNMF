Resource allocation plays an important role in constructing scalable and green VCDC. This work presents a novel and fundamental framework to achieve dynamic fine-grained resource allocation. It develops a dynamic fine-grained resource allocation model with non-steady states according to the external and internal workload of different resource-intensive applications in a VCDC. In order to meet the SLA requirements of Gold and Silver services for various applications while maximizing profit, this work proposes a dynamic hybrid optimization algorithm by combing particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a great potential to maximize the VCDC provider’s profit. The proposed framework can aid the design and optimization of industrial cloud data centers and practitioners’ understanding of SLA aspects of various applications.
