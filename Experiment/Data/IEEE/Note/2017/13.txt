Because of approximately 50 000 wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images for one patient, a clinicianusually has to spend about 2 h to view these images andmake a diagnostic decision on possible gastrointestinal diseases.Therefore, it is crucial to design an automatic computer-aidedsystem to assist clinicians to classify images with abnormalstructures. However, most WCE abnormality detection methods consider only one specific abnormality and the existingmultiabnormality classification results are far from satisfactory.Thus, we propose a novel automatic multiabnormality WCEimage detection scheme, namely, saliency and adaptive localityconstrained linear coding algorithm, by considering the localcoding bases adaptively and the saliency information about theimages. Results from comprehensive comparison experimentssuggest that the proposed computer-aided classification systemachieves improved accuracy.
