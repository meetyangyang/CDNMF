Variability in natural objects is usually several orders of magnitude higher than that for manufactured goods and has remained a challenge. As a result;  most solutions to inspection problems of natural products today still have humans in the loop. One of the factors influencing the success rate of color machine vision in detecting a target is its ability to characterize colors. When unrelated features are very close to the target in the color space;  which may not pose a significant problem to an experienced operator;  they appear as noise and often result in false detection. This paper illustrates the applicability of the algorithm with a number of representative automation problems in the context of food processing applications. As demonstrated experimentally;  the artificial color contrast and statistically based fast bounded box methods can significantly improve the success rate of the detection by reducing the standard deviation of both the target and noise pixels;  enlarging the separation between feature clusters in color space;  and more tightly characterize the feature color from its background. The algorithm presented here has several advantages;  including simplicity in training and fast classification;  since only three simple checks of rectangular bounds are performed.
