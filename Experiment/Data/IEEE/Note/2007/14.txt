Structural tools are provided for the analysis of models used in the context of fault detection and isolation for discrete event systems. The systems that are concerned are either manufacturing processes;  batch processes;  digital devices;  or communication protocols with single or multiple failures. Methods are proposed to decide;  in a systematic way;  if the considered failures can be detected and isolated according to the existing sensors. The obtained results can also be used by designers for sensor selection.
