Robots have been widely used in manufacturingautomation. This paper presents a unique Petri net formalism to modeland control deadlock problems in automated manufacturing systems whererobots are used as material handling devices. This formalism allows one toavoid the deadlocks that may arise due to the competition of part deliveryprocesses for robots. More important, it allows robots to be used as temporary buffers to resolve otherwise deadlock situations. The proposed Petrinet models and deadlock control method assume both theoretical and practical significance.
