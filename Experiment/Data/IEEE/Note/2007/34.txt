In today¡¯s markets, companies tend to compete with product costs and delivery times. Mass customization principles have emerged as ways of gaining competitiveness. To individualize offerings of products, some companies manage options and alternatives around the same product category. Large product portfolios allow customers to select products closely matching their needs, however, it usually implies a larger cost to the producer. The importance of demand for final products when allocating assembly operations in a supply chain is emphasized. The research reported in this paper demonstrates that for the same level of anticipated product demand, the level and mix of stock impact the customer delivery time. The latter implies that the same degree of customer satisfaction could be realized with different anticipated stock levels and costs. An assemble-to-order(ATO) case study is presented. The ATO production strategy considers a tradeoff between the size of a product portfolio and the assembly lead time. The concept of modular design is often used in support of the ATO strategy. Modular design impacts the assembly of products and the supply chain, in particular, the storage, transport, and production are affected by the selected modular structure.
