/i>\n - This paper designs a fast simulation-based methodology to compose a good scheduling policy from various dispatching rules of fab operations. The methodology innovatively applies DOE to estimate performance of dispatching rule combinations (policies) over various machines groups in a fab;  screens out good enough policy options by using OO over the performance estimation;  and allocates computation time intelligently to simulate potentially good options. Our study shows that OO-based DOE simulations require 2-3 orders of magnitude less computation time than those of a traditional approach. The high speedup enables fab managers to identify good scheduling policies from the many combinations of wafer release and dispatching rules.
