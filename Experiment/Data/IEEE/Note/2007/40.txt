- Petri-net (PN) models can be effectively used in the development and validation of industrial logic-control systems as long as well-structured modeling techniques are available that can be easily automated in a computer-aided design environment. This paper introduces a structured and modular novel design methodology based on PNs;  which constructs the logic-control model in an incremental fashion;  taking progressively into account the user's product-flow specifications;  in terms of composition constraints on the operation execution. Each step of the design process increases the model according to rules which guarantee that it holds specific well-definiteness properties. In particular;  the methodology prevents possible design mistakes from leading to deadlocks. From a practical point of view;  the design process fits the step-by-step specification method that is commonly adopted quite well;  with the great advantage of having immediate feedback on the formal correctness of the model at each step. Also;  given a suitable implementation in software packages;  the interaction with the user does not require specific knowledge of PNs. The actual control logic can then be obtained by adding the resource model to the product-flow model and detailing operations.
