This paper was motivated by observing sheetmetal parts in various shapes that are arranged on a rectangular sheet manually to minimize the usage of the sheet. The manual arrangements are highly dependent on one's expertise and experience but the results may vary from case to case. Existing approaches to arrange the parts automatically are usually time-consuming for dealing with parts in complicated shapes. This paper suggests a simple approach using a new decomposition method to describe the parts and the sheet;  and a part placing method to efficiently decide the position of each part in a sequence. The part sequences are automatically generated by a known searching algorithm. The proposed approach has been tested in many industrial cases and the results suggest its feasibility and efficiency. In future research;  we will address the cases requiring \offsets\ among parts.
