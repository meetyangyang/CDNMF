Cycle time reduction has constantly beena key focus of semiconductor manufacturing. Compared with simulation, queueing theory-based analytical modeling is much fasterin estimating manufacturing system performance and providingmore insights for performance improvement. Therefore, queueingmodeling attracts generous semiconductor research grants. Unfortunately, existing queueing models focus on simple extensions ofthe classical queueing theory and fail to question its applicability tothe complicated SMS. Hence, related researches have not been employed widely in the semiconductor industry. In this paper, we conduct a survey on the important works and also present some openproblems. We also propose a novel solution by relaxing a key assumption in the classical queueing theory. We are currently fundedby Intel to explore this potential solution, and we hope it can fosteran interesting research field for the years to come.
