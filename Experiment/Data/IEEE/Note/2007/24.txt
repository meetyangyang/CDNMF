This paper considers dynamic lot-sizing models with bounded inventory and outsourcing or backlogging decisions. Based on the forecasted requirements of a given item for each period of the planning horizon;  the problem consists of determining the quantity to be produced inhouse or to be ordered from a supplier and the quantity to be outsourced in each period to minimize a total cost over the considered planning horizon;  composed of the production or purchasing cost;  inventory holding cost;  and the backlogging cost or the outsourcing cost. These problems initially come from real-life crude oil procurement and often arise in many companies. In this paper;  we consider two models. In one model;  backlogging is allowed with a backlogging penalty while there is no possibility of outsourcing. In the other model;  all of the customer requirements are satisfied in time (i.e.;  without backlogging) but outsourcing is possible. For each model;  we develop an algorithm to find an optimal solution. The computation time of these algorithms can be bounded by a one or two degree polynom of the number of periods in the planning horizon;  which means that the computation time required to find an optimal solution is very short.
