The method presented in this paper aims to automate the inspection of nonaccessible pipe surfaces. The method was thought to be employed in the inspection of sewers; however;  it could be used in many other industrial applications and could also be extended to other shapes rather than tubular structures. A laser ring profiler;  consisting;  for instance;  of a laser diode and a ring projector;  can be easily integrated into existing closed-circuit television systems. The proposed algorithm identifies defective areas and categorizes the types of defects;  analyzing the successive recorded camera images that will contain the reflected ring of light. The algorithm;  that can be used online;  makes use of the deformation of the reflected laser ring together with its changes in intensity. The fact of combining the two kinds of data using artificial-intelligent algorithms makes the method robust enough to work in harsh environments.
