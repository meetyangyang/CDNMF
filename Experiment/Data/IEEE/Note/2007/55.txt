- This work was motivated by the requirement of remote monitoring and supervision of semiconductor manufacturing systems. In such human-in-the-loop and large-scale systems;  certain human operations may violate desired safety requirements and result in catastrophic failure. Moreover;  the overall complexity of most existing Petri net modeling and analysis approaches significantly increases with the size of the considered systems. This paper suggests a modular supervisory scheme for modeling and synthesis of supervisory agents using Petri nets. The proposed method contributes a promising tool for preventing abnormal operations from being carried out to semiconductor manufacturing systems which;  if appropriately modified;  may be also applied to other types of discrete event systems.
