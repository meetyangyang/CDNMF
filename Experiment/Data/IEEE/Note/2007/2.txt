The motivation of this research is to develop a geometric solution for the design automation of customized free-form objects;  which can greatly improve the efficiency of design processes in various industries involving customized products (e.g.;  garment design;  toy design;  jewel design;  shoe design;  and glasses design;  etc.). The products in the above industries are usually composed of a very complex geometry shape (represented by free-form surfaces);  and is not driven by a parameter table but a reference object with free-form shapes (e.g.;  mannequin;  toy;  wrist;  foot;  and head models). After carefully designing a product around one particular reference model;  it is desirable to have an automated tool for \grading\ this product to other shape-changed reference objects while retaining the original spatial relationship between the product and reference models. This is called the design automation of a customized free-form object. Current commercial 3-D/2-D computer-aided design (CAD) systems;  developed for the design automation of models with regular shape;  cannot support the design automation in this manner. The approach in this paper develops efficient techniques for constraining and reconstructing a product represented by free-form surfaces around reference objects with different shapes;  so that this design automation problem can be fundamentally solved. Although the approach has not been integrated into commercial CAD systems;  the results based on our preliminary implementation are encouraging-the spatial relationship between reference models and the customized products is well preserved.
