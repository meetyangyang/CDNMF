The design of autonomous multirobot systems with various applications;  such as in parts production or search and destroy operations in a military environment;  is of growing importance. Here;  we integrate economic and technical issues into an unified engineering design framework for the manufacturers of robots. Our approach leads to manufacturer design decisions that are robust relative to the market for a manufacturer's products. Robot component aspects;  such as sensors and communications as well as mission performance aspects;  can be captured and coupled into the design process. We use the design of intervehicle cooperation and robot group size to illustrate this approach. The practical significance lies in the fact that we take a broad perspective on engineering design;  one closer to the real world;  due to the considerations of marketplace economics. Moreover;  the approach provides a framework to study design choices that escape systematic analysis in other frameworks (e.g.;  group size).
