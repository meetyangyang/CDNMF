In a hybrid shop floor control system;  the objective of global system performance conflicts with the objective of a timely response to local disturbances. For a given disturbance;  there is a need to compare the cost (e.g.;  computation time) associated with supervisory level rescheduling against the potential improvement in system performance that this rescheduling can provide. If the cost of rescheduling is higher;  rescheduling at the subordinate level will be appropriate. Otherwise;  rescheduling at the supervisory level will be appropriate. In this paper;  manufacturing scheduling problems of various complexities are used to discuss the tradeoff between the objectives listed above. We then use these problems to show how to find an appropriate threshold value to trigger subordinate or supervisory level rescheduling. Limited classes of performance metrics are considered. Work is currently being carried out to extend the approach to broader performance metrics. It is believed that our results can be applied to other systems for which hierarchical structures are commonly used. Examples of such systems exist in the transportation;  health-care;  and defense sectors.
