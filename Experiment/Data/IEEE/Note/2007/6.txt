This paper is concerned with grasping an object by a robotic hand. This article address how to grasp the object;  namely;  how to position every finger on the object. Recently;  robots are desired to be used in housekeeping and in caring for elderly people. For this purpose;  robot (multifingered) hands are equipped with the robots as general-purpose end effectors. The robot hands are required to automatically move to accomplish such tasks. In this case;  the most fundamental issue for robot hands is to grasp the object. At home;  there are many various-shaped objects. Consider the case where the robot (hand) is commanded to perform a certain task;  such as putting the object into a box. In this case;  the robot (hand) must grasp such an object (of any arbitrary shape) with appropriate grasp positions for completing the task. Therefore;  the appropriate grasp positions must be calculated automatically. This article addresses a method to solve this problem. But to complete the grasping task;  the following problems remain: calculation and control of the appropriate grasping forces.
