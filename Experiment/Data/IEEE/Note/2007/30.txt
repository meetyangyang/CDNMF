Since the burst of the dot com bubble, many procurement professionals and purchasing managers have begun to question the ability of the Internet to redefine procurement processes within their firms. In this paper, we set out to show that this would be a misplaced sense of deja vu because the Internet, along with a milieu of decision technologies based on game theory and optimization, is proving to be a significant tool in the hands of procurement professionals. Sans all of the hype, the dot com phenomena has left useful ideas behind including that of e-platforms for online auctions. Building upon this core conceptual construct familiar to most procurement professionals, we set out to survey the exciting field of research that this has opened up with a vast potential for immediate and gainful applications. We review the existing state of the art in this field, track its recent developments, and classify the models available for different procurement scenarios. We also provide pointers to areas that require further fundamental as well as applied research which calls for the attention of not just academic researchers but also practicing professionals.
