Although this study is concerned with the cooling of a fleet of miniature robots, the results and solutions proposed here could potentially be applied to other distributed systems where cooling is necessary. More specifically, for the cases where cooling of individual units is not practical nor possible due to higher costs and/or technical constraints, to name but a few reasons, this paper proposes a global convection cooling approach of all units performed within a chamber. The experimental data can be used to assess the viability of this approach to other situations and help identifying potential issues prior to the implementation. Furthermore, the experimental data can be used to provide additional information on issues and challenges facing the optimal distribution of such units constrained to operate within relatively tight operating temperature ranges, and the limits of such approach including potential issues related to temperature fluctuations caused by local turbulences.
