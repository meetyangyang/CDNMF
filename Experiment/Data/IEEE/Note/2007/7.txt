 In recent times;  electronic marketplaces have provided an efficient way for businesses and consumers to trade goods and services. The use of innovative mechanisms and algorithms has made it possible to improve the efficiency of electronic marketplaces by enabling optimization of revenues for the marketplace and of utilities for the buyers and sellers. In this paper;  we look at single-item;  multiunit electronic exchanges. These are electronic marketplaces where buyers submit bids and sellers ask for multiple units of a single item. We allow buyers and sellers to specify volume discounts using suitable functions. Such exchanges are relevant for high-volume business-to-business trading of standard products;  such as silicon wafers;  very large-scale integrated chips;  desktops;  telecommunications equipment;  commoditized goods;  etc. The problem of determining winners and prices in such exchanges is known to involve solving many NP-hard problems. Our paper exploits the familiar idea of decomposition;  uses certain algorithms from the literature;  and develops two fast heuristics to solve the problem in a near optimal way in worst-case polynomial time.
