Scheduling a bottleneck station in ATMis challenging due to expensive equipment, high product mixture,and fluctuant market demands. It is desirable to maximize theequipment utilization and minimize machine conversion time ofthe bottleneck station. In practice, a manual scheduling methodwas utilized at an Intel chipset factory and the performance wasnot satisfactory. To this end, we develop a production scheduling system for a bottleneck station using the ACO technique.ACO is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that adapts thebiological metaphor of a colony of cooperating ants. The systemtakes into account business rules and prioritized objectives inATM. The scheduling system was successfully implemented andoperated in an Intel chipset factory in 2005. By leveraging thesystem in a production environment, we design and conductnumerical experiments to optimize the system parameter tuningstrategy. Comparing to a previously existing manual approach, theACO-based scheduling system reduced the machine conversion time of a bottleneck station by 20% and saved Intel millions ofdollars.
