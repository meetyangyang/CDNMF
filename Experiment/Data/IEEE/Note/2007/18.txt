- General guidance for monitoring a machine's performance is included below. Calculate the coherence parameter phi and establish the base-line temporal coherences of a machine operating in good condition for future reference;  or for a similar machine that is known to be in good operating condition. Continuously monitor the machine's rotational signals via accelerometer or microphone;  measuring the temporal coherences using the FFT-derived coherence parameter phi. Calculate/display the temporal coherence time histories of phi for the rotational signals. Analyze the phi coherence patterns. A constant thickness;  continuously nonrandom;  phi temporal coherence time history pattern;  indicates fault-free machine operation. A decreasing spread in the phi time history pattern with time indicates increasing temporal coherence of a rotational frequency component due to a mechanical fault. The frequency indicates which machine component is faulty. Possible problem: a fault associated with a bearing (e.g.;  a crack in a bearing race). A broadening phi time history pattern of a rotational frequency component indicates decreasing temporal coherence. Possible problems: need for maintenance;  worn out lubrication;  or foreign matter (dust;  grit;  sand) in the bearing.
