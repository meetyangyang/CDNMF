This work was motivated by the need to develop an intelligent and efficient RbR process controller;  especially for the control of processes with short production runs as in the case of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. A novel controller that is presented here is capable of generating optimal control actions in the presence of multiple time-frequency disturbances;  and allows the use of realistic (often complex) process models without sacrificing robustness and speed of execution. Performance measures;  such as reduction of variability in process output and control recipe;  minimization of initial bias;  and ability to control processes with high autocorrelations are shown to be superior in comparison to the commercially available exponentially weighted moving average controllers. The WRL-RbR controller is very generic;  and can be easily extended to processes with drifts and sudden shifts in the mean and variance. The viability of extending the controller to distributed input parameter sensing environments;  including those for which process models are not available;  is also discussed.
