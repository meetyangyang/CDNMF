Although transgenic organisms have been produced for the last 20 years, their full potential has not yet been realized. The power of the transgenic animal as a research tool lies in our ability to understand the functional consequences of gene expression or deletion during development. Producing organisms for these experiments is currently quite labor intensive and is inefficient for the reliable production of large numbers of transgenic organisms. Now that the genome is sequenced there is a pressing need to understand the functions of thousands of newly identified genes. Just as high throughput technology has revolutionized the human genome project, large-scale functional analysis can benefit from the use of automation and array technology. As a result the goal of this research is to understand the effect of force feedback in cell injection tasks and thereby use the results to improve the interface used by technicians to improve the outcome of biomanipulation tasks, particularly those leading to transgenesis.
