- This paper describes an analytic method for estimating the average time for the AMHS to respond to lots ready for movement in a 300 mm wafer fab. The analysis is based on a large-scale model;  requires standard solvers;  and provides a very fast and reasonably accurate alternative to high-fidelity simulation. It is intended to support the early stage of fab design/redesign;  allowing engineers to examine many different options before committing to the time and expense of simulation.
