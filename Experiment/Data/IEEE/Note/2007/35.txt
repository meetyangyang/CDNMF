A good design methodology is essential for the study of the optimal layout in an automated container terminal. Port designers need to select the most efficient automated-guided-vehicle (AGV) transportation system;  and to set the appropriate number of agents operating in the system. This study presents a hybrid design methodology and a cost-effectiveness comparison of the vertical and the horizontal transportation systems. Our proposed design methodology is able to derive the combinatorial optimal design solutions rapidly;  and at the same time pin point the bottleneck in the system. This proposed methodology can be easily applied to any transportation or logistics system;  provided the system can be divided into components represented as nodes in a graph. Our results demonstrate that the horizontal AGV transportation system is more effective than the vertical AGV transportation system under most demand scenarios.
