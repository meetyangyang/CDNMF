 Abstraction or unmodeled-dynamics can lead to nondeterminism that causes a system to transition to one of many states when certain events occur at certain states. For nondeterministic systems, specifying the usual state-sequencing constraints may not be adequate and state-branching constraints may also need to be specified such as: All paths contain a state starting from where all future states satisfy a certain property. Such a property is not expressible as language equivalence, but can be expressed using more general simulation equivalence. Simulation equivalence can specify all state-sequencing properties and the universal state-branching properties. The present paper studies the control of a (nondeterministic) system so that the controlled system satisfies a simulation equivalence specification. A main contribution is to show that as is the case with language equivalence specifications, the control problem can be solved polynomially. Specializations to deterministic systems and deterministic controls are also considered.
