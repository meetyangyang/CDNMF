Semiconductor manufacturing (SM) systems areone of the most complicated manufacturing systems. Usually, there areplenty of wafers for different products which follow specific processingroutes. Rather than job shop or flow shop system, SM is a reentrant systemin which the lots may visit some machines more than once for differentprocess steps. The reentrant characteristic intensifies the competition oflots for machines and significantly increases the waiting-in-queue time oflots. Heuristic scheduling strategies such as FIFO and SRPT are oftenused in wafer fabs. These strategies are simple and easy to use, but each ofthem only considers one particular aspect of the complicated schedulingproblem. The proposed CPD solves the scheduling problem with multiple objectives, such as reducing cycle time, increasing throughput, andavoiding WIP overstock.
