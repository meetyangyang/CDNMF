This paper has been motivated by the problem of designing reconfigurable modular logic controllers. Reconfiguration is important in manufacturing;  but it has also been an issue in the software design domain. There are software systems that currently exist;  such as active data bases or expert systems with very powerful reconfiguration capabilities enabled by event-condition-action (ECA) rules. This paper applies the ECA concept to the design of modular logic controllers. This paper begins by describing what an ECA logic system is and then focuses on how ECA logic systems can be implemented with modular control approaches. To this end;  two designs are considered. First;  modular finite state machines are used to construct ECA logic systems;  and a theoretical framework is built using this approach. Three qualitative measures for reconfigurability (modularity;  integrability;  and diagnosability) are presented and the controllers are evaluated using these measures. Second;  an implementation using the IEC 61499 function block standard is presented as it is a widely understood and accepted standard for modular control applications. Future work entails theoretical analysis using modular verification techniques that exploit a controller structure.
