Automated electroplating lines are commonly used in the production of many products, such as printed circuit boards. The productivity of these systems depends heavily on effective scheduling of the material handling hoists that move the products between the processing tanks. This paper studies the hoist scheduling problem in systems where the processing times in the tanks and the inter tank move times are fixed parameters. An efficient optimal algorithm is developed to solve the problem with any number of hoists. The resulting schedule can be programmed as programmable logic controller codes to directly control the hoist operations. The algorithm can also be used to develop heuristic solutions for multihoist scheduling in systems where the processing times may vary in given intervals.
