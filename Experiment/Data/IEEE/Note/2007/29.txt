This paper was motivated by the problem that pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras may change their poses from time to time to achieve better monitoring results. Whenever there is a change;  we need to recalibrate the extrinsic parameters again. In this paper;  we demonstrate a new and efficient approach to calibrate multiple PTZ cameras. The concept of our approach originated from the observation that people could usually make a rough estimate about the tilt angle of the camera simply based on some clues revealed in the captured images. Based on our approach;  we can simply use some A4 papers on a table to calibrate multiple PTZ cameras. In our approach;  there is no need to calculate the commonly used homography matrix. For real cases;  once a set of PTZ cameras is settled;  we can simply place a few simple patterns on a horizontal plane. These patterns can be A4 papers;  books;  boxes;  etc.; and the horizontal plane can be a tabletop or the ground plane. The whole procedure does not need specially designed calibration patterns and requires only a light computational load. In the near future;  we will work on the extension of the proposed approach so that we will be able to perform dynamic calibration when the PTZ cameras are under movement.
