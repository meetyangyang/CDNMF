We develop extensions to intuitiveclosed-form approximations for the mean cycle time in queueingnetworks. Such approximations can be used to analyze thetradeoffs between equipment utilization and cycle time in amanufacturing facility. The extensions incorporate issues ofpractical import that have not been modeled in the literature andwere motivated by the inability of existing models to accuratelydescribe the performance of manufacturing in IBM¡¯s 200 mmsemiconductor wafer fabricator. The utility of our extensions isthat, using automated data collection systems, we are able to wellmodel production tools and elucidate the sources of cycle time.
