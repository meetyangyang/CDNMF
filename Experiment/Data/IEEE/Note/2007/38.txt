Energy buy-back programs have grownin popularity in the last decade. For example, Wisconsin Electric(WE) introduced several so-called energy buy-back programsseven years ago, one of which is referred as power market incentives (PMI). Under the PMI program, WE pays participatingcustomers a premium for voluntarily reducing their electricity usewhen it is activated. Several interesting issues emerge from thissituation. The first is whether, from a manufacturing firm¡¯s viewpoint, it is worth shutting down a production system to participatein the program at a particular time during a peak period (whenthe incentive program is activated), and in which part (portion) ofthe peak period the firm should participate. The second issue ishow the firm should dynamically decide on its production policyover time in the presence of such an incentive program. In thispaper, we provide simple models to give insights into the nature ofthese problems.
