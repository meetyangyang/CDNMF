The work is carried out as part of the polymetallic nodule mining program of the Government of India. The technique of slip control is a specific requirement for a tracked vehicle used in the deep sea. Slip is common in many vehicles-tracked and otherwise. Examples are steam engines in the early days and ordinary cars while negotiating slush or snow/ice and dozers working in soft soil. While these are manually controlled by drivers who have firsthand knowledge of the environmental conditions;  in the case of a mining machine in deep sea;  it has to be completely automatic and;  hence;  is challenging. The knowledge generated in this work could be effectively used by practitioners in other related areas of automobile engineering for updating their expertise. Also;  similar techniques may be used for maneuvering vehicles sent to other planets.
