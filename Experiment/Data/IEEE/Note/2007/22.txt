In the last decade;  monitoring;  fault detection;  and diagnosis methodologies based on the use of discrete-event models have been successfully used in a variety of technological systems ranging from document processing systems to intelligent transportation systems. This paper was motivated by the problem of fault diagnosis for modular (distributed) dynamic discrete-event systems (DES). As a DES modeling formalism;  Petri nets offer potential advantages in terms of the distributed representation of the system and the ability to represent coupling of the system components. The systems studied in this paper are sets of modules coupled with each other through various system components and modeled using Petri nets. We present a distributed fault diagnosis algorithm which allows each module in the distributed system to diagnose its faults independently unless completion of a task requires the use of coupled components. In the case of coupling;  modules communicate with each other to accurately diagnose the fault. The distributed fault diagnosis algorithm recovers the monolithic diagnosis information at the cost of communication and growing communication overhead. To mitigate that problem;  we present an improved version of the algorithm that significantly reduces the communication overhead. Finally;  we introduce the software toolbox (written in Matlab and integrated with AT&T Graphviz) and we present a case study of an example of a heating;  ventilation;  and air-conditioning system where we use the software tool for modeling and analyzing the system.
