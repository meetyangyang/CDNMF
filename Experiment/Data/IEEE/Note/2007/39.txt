This research work focuses on a challenging rescheduling problem related to the production anddistribution of rapidly perishable goods. The approach presentedin the paper aims at achieving a compromise between four fundamental issues (quality of solution, search time, robustness toperturbations, and transparency of the decision algorithm) thatcannot be easily obtained with general-purpose solvers proposedto practitioners. The presented algorithm integrates three tools (amathematical programming model, a genetic algorithm, and a setof constructive heuristics) in a global metaheuristic reschedulingalgorithm. The approach does not provide guarantees about thecloseness to optimality of the solutions, but gives interesting resultson numerical experiments based on two large-scale industrial casestudies. Although the presented rescheduling method is tailoredfor a specific just-in-time supply problem, it may be profitablyextended to a number of similar production and distributionproblems by redefining the model constraints and objectives, andadapting the reconstructive heuristics accordingly.
