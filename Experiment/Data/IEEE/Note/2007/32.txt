Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging offers an instant, noninvasive inspection method for detecting biomedical abnormalities. However, the huge amount of hyperspectral image data often makes real-time computer processing a challenging task. This paper suggests a band selection method of hyperspectral images based on the recursive divergence for the automatic detection of poultry carcasses. This method avoids transforming the original hyperspectral images to the feature space. Instead, it maximizes the class separability by considering the correlation information of spectral bands. In this paper, we mathematically characterize the use of divergence for bands election. Also, a set of recursive equations for the calculation of divergence with an additional band is derived to overcome the computational restrictions in real-time processing. The method may be extended to detect other biomedical abnormalities as well. In future research, we will incorporate the spatial and spectral information of the data in the development of appropriate band selection techniques for the hyperspectral data processing.
