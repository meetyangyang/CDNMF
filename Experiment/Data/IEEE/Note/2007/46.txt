Biochip microarrays have been widelyused for genomics and proteomics research. Many methods havebeen proposed for massive microarray fabrication. Inkjet technology is one of the most promising approaches for industrial scalemicroarray fabrication. One challenge for industrial scale microarray fabrication is the automation of the production process.This paper intends to address this issue by presenting an industrialsystem that integrates biological fluid dispensing, robotic materialhandling, vision and computer control into a single automationframework. The presented automation functions may also beuseful in other laboratory automation systems.
