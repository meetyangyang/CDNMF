Kits are often reconfigurable in production but manufacturers could not take advantage of the kit reconfiguration due to the increasing complexity of the resultant production planning. In this paper, we report the first hierarchical modeland industrial implementation of a complete capacity planning solution with kit reconfiguration, which saves Intel millions of dollarsin kit purchasing. Since the methodology is a general mathematicalframework, it can be easily adapted by other industries in whichkits are reconfigurable for different products.
