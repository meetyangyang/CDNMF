In this paper, a concept for the generation of flexible control sequences for a partly automated disassembly system has been presented, which can cope with the disassembly object variety, different product conditions, as well as product amounts. Washing machines were chosen as an example for the product group domestic appliances. The approach is directed at the planning level and cell-control level. The concept for the generation of disassembly control sequences consists of a function unit for the disassembly control system. The procedure, which will be implemented in the module, considers the availability of disassembly tools and the technological feasibility of disassembly processes and tools. A modular control sequence will be generated by the programmed function unit. The developed control concept can also be applied for very small lot-sized manufacturing and assembly tasks.
