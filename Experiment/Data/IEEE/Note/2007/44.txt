Heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems constitute largest portion of energy consumption equipment. Eventhough safety is not a critical issue in HVAC industry, the complexity ofmodern HVAC systems, the operational and maintenance costs associatedwith the equipment are calling for sophisticated automatic fault diagnosistools. Among the HVAC components chillers are primarily known for significant energy consumption. Presently, very little of the existing researchon fault diagnosis of HVAC systems is aimed at chillers and suffers fromcertain drawbacks. The primary goal of this paper is to address these issues and develop a generic fault diagnosis tool applicable to any HVACcomponent. In this vein, we proposed a data-driven approach based onneural network and statistical tools for fault diagnosis, and nominal modeldevelopment. Since chillers are an example of a data-rich environment weadopted a genetic algorithm based approach for optimal sensor selection formaximizing the diagnosibility. The approach is also validated on an experimental data from 90-t centrifugal chiller provided by the American Societyof Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers and also has apotential for practical application.
