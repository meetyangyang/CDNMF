These days computer-aided design (CAD) and finite-element modeling (FEM) are widely used for sheet metal stamping;  especially in the automotive and aerospace industries. However;  fault diagnosis and die tryout still rely heavily on the experiences of the engineers/machinists on the shop floor. An existing diagnosis method compares the strain distribution calculated using FEM and the experimental strain distribution;  which is calculated from the measured deformation of the initial grid pattern. However;  this method is time consuming as it requires the initial grid pattern preparation by either chemical etching or laser marking. This paper presents a new method for diagnosing sheet metal stamping processes. The new method compares the thermal distribution calculated using FEM and the experimental thermal distribution result;  which can be acquired using an infrared (IR) camera. Therefore;  it is more convenient to use it on the shop floor. The thermal FEM can be found based on strain FEM. However;  the infrared image is 2-D and;  hence;  3-D thermal distribution reconstruction is often necessary. This paper includes several practical examples. Some practical concerns;  such as the conduction heat lost to the environment and the infrared camera viewing angles;  are also discussed.
