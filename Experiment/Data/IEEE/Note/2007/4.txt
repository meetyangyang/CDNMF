The results proposed in this paper allow: 1) building discrete event system models in which faults may arise; 2) testing the diagnosability of the model; and 3) implementing an online diagnoser. The modeling methodology helps to conceive in a natural way the model from the description of the system's components leading to modules that are easily interconnected. The diagnosability test is stated as a linear programming problem which can be straightforward programmed. Finally;  the algorithm for online diagnosis leads to an efficient procedure that monitors the system's outputs and handles the normal behavior model. This provides an opportune detection and location of faults occurring within the system.
