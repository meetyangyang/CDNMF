This paper is concerned with the parameter design and verification of a complex fixture that consists of more locators;  supports;  and clamps than needed for force closure. There are two essential issues related to the design problems: 1) the test on whether the workpiece can be in contact with all locators simultaneously (approachable) and 2) the test on whether the workpiece can reach the desired location smoothly (accessible). A procedure for system analysis and performance verification of the rigid complex fixture is outlined in this paper. In the procedure;  a linear programming with its dual formulation is applied to establish the sufficient condition for the stable state and to recognize the locators and supports. A performance index is provided to verify if a fixture is accessible;  and a quantitative test is used to check whether a fixture has force closure. In the future;  the linear and nonlinear compliance models of complex fixtures will be discussed and incorporated with this rigid model for the implementation of a complete analysis and design tool of the complex fixture.
