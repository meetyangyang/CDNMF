This paper presents a method for integrated production planning and scheduling in a three-stage manufacturing system consisting of a forward chain of three kinds of workshops;  which is common in such enterprises as producers of automobiles and household electric appliances;  as in the case of an autobody plant usually with the stamping workshop;  the welding and assembling workshop;  and the painting workshop. Herein;  the production planning and scheduling problems are simultaneously addressed in the way that a feasible production plan can be obtained and the inventory reduced. A batch splitting and amalgamating algorithm is proposed for balancing the production time of the production lines. And a case study of the integrated planning and scheduling problem in a real autobody plant verifies the effectiveness of our method.
