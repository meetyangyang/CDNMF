Speed of manufacturing is an important metric of factory performance;  yet it has long been a challenge to integrate its value into overall performance evaluation. However;  for many semiconductor products;  a predictable rate of decline in selling prices makes it possible to transform time value into monetary value. This study employs a novel method to incorporate a speed metric into economic efficiency evaluation and thereby provide a guideline for improving fab efficiency in manufacturing practice. Furthermore;  this study integrates factory productivity and cycle time into a relative efficiency analysis model that jointly evaluates the impact of these two factors in manufacturing performance. In particular;  we validate this approach with data from ten leading wafer fabs obtained by the Competitive Semiconductor Manufacturing Program and we discuss managerial implications.
