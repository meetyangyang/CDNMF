This work was driven by the need to estimate vehicular traffic at a large scale, in an online setting, usingcommodity hardware. Machine Learning algorithms combinedwith streaming data are not new, but it still requires deep expertiseboth in Machine Learning and in Computer Systems to achievelarge scale computations in a tractable manner. The StreamingSpark project aims at providing an interface that abstracts outall the technical details of the computation platform (cloud, HPC,workstation, etc.).As shown in this work, Streaming Spark is suitable for implementing and calibrating nontrivial algorithms on a large cluster,and provides an intuitive yet powerful programming interface. Thereaders are invited to refer to the source code referred in this article for more examples.This paper presents algorithms to sample and compute densities for Gamma random variables restricted to a hyperplane (i.e.,distributions of the form with independantGamma distributions). It is common in this case to use Gaussianrandom variables because of closed-form solutions to solve. If oneconsiders positive valued distributions with heavy tails, our formulas using gamma distributions may be more suitable.
