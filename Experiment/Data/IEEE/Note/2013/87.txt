This paper was motivated by the problem of how to automatically configure the guidance system of a flexible Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) operating as part of a Flexible Material Handling System (FMHS). The automatic guide-path design consists of calculating the shortest paths to supply material to or from warehouse and production lines. These routes are configured by defining positions from which to perform navigation and docking maneuvers. This work is focused on the automatic and robust configuration of the initial position from which to perform a safe and reliable load transfer operation. Adopting the Continuous-Curvature (CC) Steer method to generate high-quality drive-paths for accurate and precise docking operations, the problem consists of the automatic selection of the initial position from which to initiate the load transfer operation given a target position (docking station) and the representation of obstacles in the workplace. The most problematic issue is that while CC Steer method generates routes particularly appropriate to be followed by car-like vehicles, such trajectories can differ significantly from the expected ones under slight modifications of the initial position. This problem makes the selection of reliable waypoints that generate collision-free trajectories a demanding task. We use an unconstrained optimization method coupled with probabilistic techniques to perform a robust and automatic configuration of waypoints for load transfer operations.
