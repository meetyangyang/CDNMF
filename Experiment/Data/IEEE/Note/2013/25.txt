This paper was motivated by the need ofprecise manipulation and effective motion control of flexure-basedmicro/nano manipulators and a need of faster, sensitive, andextremely precise measuring devices. Ultra-precise manipulationis one of the very important techniques in the field of micro/nanoengineering. In general, flexure-based mechanisms driven bypiezoelectric actuators are the most commonly employed components for micro/nano manipulation. Generally, in the studies offlexure-based mechanisms, the emphasis has been mostly confinedto the mechanical design, kinematic modeling and stiffness analysis. Limited effort has been made to demonstrate an effectivemotion tracking control for flexure-based mechanism. In thisresearch, laser interferometry-based sensing and measurementsystem is proposed and implemented for the intelligent motioncontrol of flexure-based manipulator. As a part of this research, enhancement in the positioning accuracy and tracking performancewith the laser interferometry-based feedback is investigated.The focus is given to examine and characterise the sensing modality of the laser-based sensing and measurement system.The experimental results presented in this paper demonstrateeffective, precise and accurate position tracking of flexure-basedmechanism. Future research based on laser interferometry-basedclosed-loop control for precise and accurate motion tracking ofthe flexure-based planar mechanisms is under investigation.
