This study proposes a visual control scheme for themanipulation system. Through the image recognition, the distance betweenthe tip of a probe and a fish embryo is calculated in an image plane. Themanipulation system can be applied to an automatic operation. This studypresents the process and method for practitioners interested in developingan automatic process and controller design
