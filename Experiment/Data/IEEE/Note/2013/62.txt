It is very difficult to coordinate the motionrelation between multiple kinematic chains of parallel manipulators. Successfully addressing this problem will really achieve thepotential high-speed and high-accuracy performances of parallelmanipulators, and further produce great impact to the applications of parallel machine tools. The synchronization motion relation of the kinematic chains is developed according to the mechanism characteristic of parallel manipulators. Based on the synchronization motion relation, this paper presents a new coordination control method for parallel manipulators. The experimentalresults indicate that the tracking error and the synchronizationerror of parallel manipulators can be decreased greatly by usingthe coordination control method. The proposed method can realizehigh-speed and high-accuracy motion control of parallel manipulators, and it can be extended to other motion control systems withmultiple axes.
