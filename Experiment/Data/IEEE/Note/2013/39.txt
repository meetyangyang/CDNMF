This paper was motivated by the problem of intelligent system diagnosis and supervision. Indeed, by associating diagnosis and reconfiguration aspects, all built on the samemodel, we hope to contribute to the development of a global supervisory control system. This paper presents a new approach whichcombines the Generic Component Model (GCM) and the BondGraph Model (BGM). The GCM provides a systematic tool forfinding the different reconfiguration strategies of a system whenfaults occur. Within a given operating mode, a system is reconfigurable if there exist different versions of the services which allow toachieve its current objectives. These versions are ranked accordingto a preference relation. This allows an automated real time management of the system configurations. The BGM is proposed to describe the inner procedure on which the realization of a servicerests. Its structural properties are exploited to generate fault indicators. Even if the fault mode of a lower level component cannot always be identified, interesting results can be obtained on theavailability of the associate services and in the most of the cases, itis enough to evaluate the possibility the system has or not to achievean objective. The proposed approach is applied to design a supervision system representing the management of the operating modesand giving the conditions for reconfiguration of an intelligent andautonomous vehicle. The latter should be transferable on differentsizes of port terminals in order to transport goods from one specific place to another one in both normal and degraded operatingmode. The approach can be also applied to different kind of electromechanical systems. In future research, we will address the robustdecision making diagnosis based on Fuzzy Logic Methodology inorder to facilitate the identification of vulnerabilities by identifyingthe residuals thresholds changing through time.
