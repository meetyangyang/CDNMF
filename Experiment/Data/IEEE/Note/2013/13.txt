Network synthesis begins by specifyinga set of point-to-point quality-of-service requirements of latency,throughput and error-rate. For a ZigBee-based wireless network(one of the popular networks), we present a mathematical approach to its synthesis for a given set of service specifications alongwith the geographical placement. The approach formalizes thesynthesis problem that can be adopted for other types of networks,and guarantees its correctness as well as optimality.
