Routing strategies in MHS such as BHS atairports can be complex, and thus, their implementation is tediousand error-prone. Currently, these systems are simulated to validate their control strategies, and then implemented on real equipment. With this, however, only a limited number of test cases isconsidered, and hence, routing errors may stay undetected. Thispaper proposes an approach to automatically prove the correctness of routing strategies in MHS by means of formal verification.A main difficulty of the formal verification of real-world MHS isthe so-called state space explosion, i.e., the model to be verifiedhas too many states. To also apply formal verification to these systems, a compositional approach is presented which allows to verifysystem properties with regard to routing in a reasonable amountof time. A case study shows the application of the approach to theBHS of an international airport. A number of properties with respect to routing functionality have been proven automatically forthis system, for instance, no unclear or unidentified bags reach anairplane. Furthermore, the proposed approach is not restricted torouting only and can be extended for other system properties.
