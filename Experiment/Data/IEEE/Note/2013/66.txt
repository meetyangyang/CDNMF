The original motivation for this work derives from object recognition in autonomous driving, where it isdesirable to identify objects such as cars and bicyclists in naturalstreet scenes. We showed in previous work, so long as one can segment and track objects in advance of knowing what they are, it ispossible to train accurate object detectors using a small numberof hand-labeled examples combined with a large number of unlabeled examples. The key dependency of a model-free segmentationand tracking method was available because of the structure in theautonomous driving problem. This paper aims to make these techniques applicable in more general environments. In the near term,the methods presented here can be used for real-time, online, interactive object segmentation. This can ease the process of collectingtraining data for existing object recognition systems used in automation today. In the long term, improved implementations couldbe an integral part of semi-supervised object recognition systemswhich require few hand-labeled training examples and can produce accurate recognition results.
