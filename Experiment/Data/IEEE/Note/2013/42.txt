State estimation is an important problem in manyengineering systems. In discrete event systems, state estimation problemwas formulated and investigated as a detectability problem in our previouspapers. In order to ensure detectability of the system, we need some sensors to detect the occurrences of events. Activating a sensor, collecting andtransmitting data are important problems in practice. Sensors use preciousrecourses such as battery and bandwidth. In some instances, the activationof a sensor may shorten its life or cause its destruction. Therefore, it is important that we minimize the use of sensors by activating sensors as litteras possible. The problem can be formulated as minimal sensor activationfor detectability of discrete event systems. The results in this paper can beused to develop an online strategy to activate the sensors while preservingdetectability.
