Automotive battery manufacturing has become more and more important due to the need of alternative energy source to gasoline powered engines. Although substantial amount of attention has been paid to study both individual battery cells and the battery pack as a whole;  a battery model which includes interactions of all its components (cells;  joints;  external inputs;  etc.) is not available;  and the impact of manufacturing quality on battery performance has not been investigated. In this paper;  a virtual battery simulation framework is developed to evaluate battery performance under different circumstances;  involving the issues of cell capacity;  temperature;  driving profile;  the joint (manufacturing) quality;  etc. Such a framework can help battery design and manufacturing engineers to evaluate battery performance;  investigate the impacts of manufacturing practices;  and provide feedback for improvement.
