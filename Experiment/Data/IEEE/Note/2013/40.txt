In industrial alarm systems, a main problem isthat the number of alarms operators receive is much higher than they canhandle. Our paper was motivated by this problem. In order to reduce thealarm count without sacrificing accuracy and swiftness, techniques suchas deadbands, delay timers, and filters are commonly used. In our work,an optimal filter design method is introduced to improve the performance.We present an efficient algorithm to search for optimal linear filters. Anoptimal performance curve is also introduced to illustrate the performance.We provide some mild conditions under which the moving average filteris optimal; the conditions can be tested by some well-developed statisticaltests, thus removing the necessity to optimize linear filter parameters.
