Almost all the existing AFM only has onesingle tip as the end-effector, thus during nanomanipulation, the interaction force between the object and the tip can only be appliedthrough a single point. This often leads the AFM tip to slip over orslip away from the object, and makes it difficult to realize a postureconstant manipulation during nanorod manipulation. All of thesehinder the efficiency and effectiveness of manipulation based onAFM. In order to solve the problems, a new strategy for tip-based manipulation named nano-hand is proposed. In this approach, aset of positions are first predefined based on the kinematics modelof the object. The AFM tip is then moved to these positions to generate a short pushing action to the target object in a relatively highfrequency to mimic multi-fingered hand with single AFM tip. Finally, a robotic caging at nanoscale is formed. In this way, the problems caused by a sharp single tip manipulation can be solved intoa certain extent. The simulation and experimental results show astable and controllable nanomanipulation can be obtained throughthe developed nano-hand strategy.
