In this paper, we model a relatively new material-handling system (MHS) with over 50 installations in Europe using ananalytical model, instead of simulation. The analytical model is useful in estimating key performance measures of alternate configurations of the MHSquickly and accurately, thus making it a valuable tool in the “concepting”phase of warehouse design. Practitioners typically rely on simulation forthis purpose and because of the time it takes to develop, validate, test, andrun a simulation model, they are able to analyze at most one or two design configurations. The analytical tool developed in this paper can be usedto test hundreds of alternate design configurations quickly and efficiently,thereby allowing the designer to come up with a better final warehouse design than is possible with simulation.
