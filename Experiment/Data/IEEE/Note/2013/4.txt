Because of legislative pressure, moral responsibility concern, and cost reduction goal, more and more companies are eager to investigate sustainable manufacturing systemsthat jointly consider economic, environmental, and social aspects.In this study, a method is proposed to estimate the opportunity forreal-time energy control of manufacturing systems by adjustingmachines to lower energy consumption levels without sacrificingsystem throughput. The main data sets used include machine cycletime, energy consumption modes, buffer capacity and content, andfailure history.
