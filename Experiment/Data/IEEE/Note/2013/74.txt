This paper is motivated by our previousfindings that cardiovascular diseases, e.g., myocardial infarction,alter cardiac electrical activity in space and time. However, mostof existing approaches focused on the characteristics of time-domain ECG signals (e.g., Q wave, QT interval, ST elevation/depression, T wave). This paper suggests a novel spatiotemporal warpingapproach to quantify the dissimilarity of disease-altered patternsin 3-lead space-time VCG signals. We optimize the embedding ofeach space-time VCG recording as a feature vector in the high-dimensional space that preserves the dissimilarity distance matrix.In the practice, when a new VCG recording is presented, the pattern dissimilarity will be measured against the database of N patients. Then, a new row and column will be obtained in the warpingmatrix, and a new feature vector will be embedded in the high-dimensional space. Finally, the classification model will predict cardiac conditions with this feature vector.
