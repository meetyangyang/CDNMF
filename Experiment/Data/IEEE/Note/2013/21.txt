e-Markets, such as auctions, are useful tools forscheduling resources among independent participants (agents). We proposea requirement-based bidding language which concisely and naturally expresses scheduling requirements. The key benefit of adopting this languagein the design of agent-based scheduling systems is reduced computationalcomplexities, which makes the systems more responsive to large scale, dynamic, and distributed scheduling problems.
