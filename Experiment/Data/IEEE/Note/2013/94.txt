Engineering data reuse with the incorporation of modeling knowledge is important in product design. In this paper, a new model retrieval method is proposed in which two challenging issues are addressed. First, pen-based sketching is widely gaining popularity for communicating design ideas. To accommodate this emerging trend, a method that can match a possibly partial free-form sketch to existing detailed 3-D CAD models would be of tremendous use to product design teams. Second, in a human-centered design environment, design tools should have a capacity to adapt to usersâ€™ individual habits. By using a statistical user profile model to continually learn their drawing habits, the CAD model retrieval method proposed in this paper presents a new and effective solution for user-adaptive model retrieval.
