Systems constructed from a combinationof automated separation processes can target multiple desirablematerials, refining them to specified levels of purity and recovery.The performance properties achieved by these separation systemsaffect the profitability and environmental benefit of material recycling. Current separation system modeling and optimization techniques are inadequate for capturing the behavior of separation systems for recycling, particularly systems processing multiple materials. The model presented in this paper addresses this issue byproposing a multimaterial process performance model that cancapture the behavior of any type of separation process handlingany material mixture. These separation parameters, captured fromliterature, physical modeling, or experimentation, are used, alongwith configuration data, to produce mass balance equations describing the flow of each material within the system. One limitation of this model is that it assumes fixed stage performance. Othertypes of processes used in real material recycling systems, such ascomminution, are addressed preliminarily in this paper, but further stage modeling will be necessary to combine these types ofstages with separation systems in future models.
