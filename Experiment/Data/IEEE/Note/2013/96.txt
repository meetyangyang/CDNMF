Usually, RFID systems can only identify tag within their range. Therefore, the layout of the reading zone is crucial to identify the tags of interest and prevents other tags in the proximity from being read. Identifying and localizing tags simultaneously has many potential applications. This paper presents a method of UHF RFID tag localization. It aims at mobile RFID readers as handheld or mounted on vehicles. If the RFID antenna trajectory is known, it is possible to localize a RFID tag relative to that trajectory with an accuracy of a few cm. The antenna trajectory can be given by vehicle localization systems, inertial measurement units or special fixtures.
