The steelmaking process, processing hotmetal to steel with a well-defined chemical composition and solidifying the steel into slabs, is usually the bottleneck in iron and steelproduction, and thus effective scheduling methods are crucial toimprove productivity of the production system. This paper models the steelmaking scheduling problem as a complex hybrid flowshopincluding three successive stages (steelmaking, refining, and continuous casting) with each stage having multiple parallel machines.The objective is to minimize the earliness/tardiness penalty andthe average sojourn times. We develop an effective artificial beecolony (ABC) algorithm that applies job permutations to represent individuals, and present a new neighboring solution generation method for both the employ and onlooker bees, and propose two enhanced strategies to balance the exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, a heuristic method is presented to generate a good initial solution at negligible computational effort, andtwo improvement procedures are provided to improve a schedulebased on the problem-specific characteristics. The effectiveness ofthe proposed ABC is demonstrated by comparisons against theadaptations of other well-known and recent metaheuristics. Sincethe scheduling problem in steelmaking process is very complex,in some situations buffers capacity and/or transporting capacityare limited and have to be considered. This work can be extendedto these practical problems by considering the buffers capacityand/or transporting capacity in the mathematic model. In addition, the application of the proposed ABC can also be generalizedto other hybrid flowshop scheduling problems.
