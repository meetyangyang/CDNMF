- This paper presents computational toolsnecessary for integrating optical tweezers with microfluidic chambers. These two techniques are complementary in nature and combining them enables us to realize a method for fast and accurateplacement of microparticles. The method presented in the paper isespecially useful for accurately placing cells in an array for biological experiments.
