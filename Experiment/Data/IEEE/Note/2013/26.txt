Micro/nanosystems research and development incorporates a large variety of tools and processes inorder to accomplish high precision fabrication, assembly, testingand characterization. A very common component in these tools ishigh precision positioning units (robots) that are a combination oflinear and rotary subunits (stages). Their role is to position microor nanocomponents, substrates or wafers in an accurately andrepeatable manner. Current state-of-art positioners typically spanfew inches to many feet in size. Although they are able to deliverthe required precision, range of motion, and dexterity, their sizeinhibits the merger of multiple units under a common platformleading to throughput limitations. This paper presents an attemptto develop a new class of miniaturized robots that span no morethan a few cubic millimeters in size, while delivering a subsetof the capabilities as traditional macroscale equivalents. Thetradeoffs between robot size, stiffness, range of motion, dexterity,and precision is taken to a new level where the robots are no more than two or three orders of magnitude larger than the smallestparts being manufactured.
