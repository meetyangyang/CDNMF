Control of a flexible manufacturing plantin order to produce a set of part types in a determined production cycle time is a challenging problem. In addition, the problem ismore complicated if energy efficiency is considered as an importantkey in the plant control design. This study provides methods whichtackles this complex problem for an industrial size of a pallet-constrained flow shop. The outcome is an optimal switching controlstrategy, which reduces energy consumption for idle processingmachines and maintains a desired throughput for the flow shopplant.Index Termsâ€”Energy model, flow shop plant, heuristic algorithm, optimization, pallet system.
