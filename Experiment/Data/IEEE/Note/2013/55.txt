Reducing demand on HVAC and lightingsystems by effectively using free natural resources is a good wayto conserve energy. This paper presents an integrated control ofHVACs, lights, shading blinds, and natural ventilation to minimize the total daily energy cost. A novel model is established tocapture the key interactions among the above devices. To overcome computational difficulties and obtain effective strategies in a timely manner, a price-based coordination methodology is developed to manage couplings among rooms that share an HVACsystem with a limited capacity. Interactions of these devices is thenresolved within each room by using stochastic dynamic programming. These strategies are further refined to obtain heuristic rulesfor shading blinds and natural ventilation, and simplified optimization strategies for HVACs and lights. The methods are scalable andshown to result in significant energy cost savings as compared withselected traditional control strategies.
