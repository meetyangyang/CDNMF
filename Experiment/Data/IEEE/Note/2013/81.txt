 Alarm systems have been recognized ascritical assets of industrial plants for safety and efficient operation. However, operators of industrial plants often receive far morealarms than they can handle promptly. Many alarms belong to thecorrelated alarms that almost always occur within a short time period of each other. Detecting and handling the correlated alarmscan improve the performance of alarm systems. This paper proposes a novel method to detect whether two industrial alarm signals are statistically correlated. The proposed method is applicableto alarm signals in various industrial sectors, including power andutility, process and manufacturing, and oil and gas, and is one ofthe fundamental tools in advanced alarm management systems.
