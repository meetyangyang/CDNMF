In this paper, we report on a formallanguage for knowledge representation that is used in theROBOEARTH system, a web-based knowledge base intended to belike a “Wikipedia for robots.” The objective is to enable robots toshare information about how to perform actions, how to recognizeand interact with objects, and where to find objects in an environment. The developed language allows to store such informationin a format that supports logical inference, so that robots can forexample autonomously decide if they have all prerequisites neededfor performing a described action. In laboratory experiments,the system has been applied to the exchange of pick-and-placestyle activities between two mobile manipulation robots. We arecurrently extending the representation towards more fine-grainedaction specifications.
