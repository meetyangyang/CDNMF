Mill load measuring instruments based on the acoustical signal have become a mature market product for dry ball mill in cement plant and power plant. They have been used to control the load of the dry ball mill successful. Although such instruments are also used in the wet ball mill of the mineral grinding process, only material to ball volume ratio (MBVR) can be monitored effectively. The shell vibration signal is more sensitivity and less disturb than acoustical signal. The instruments based the shell vibration signals have been developed in the dry ball mill and semi-autogenous (SAG) grinding mill. In practice, load of wet ball mill is judged by experts using multisource information. That is to say, wet ball mill load can not be measured accurately. MBVR, pulp density (PD) and charge volume ratio (CVR) parameters inside the mill have direct relationship with the mill load. In this paper, we use the useful information extracted from different signals to measure load parameters inside the ball mill.
