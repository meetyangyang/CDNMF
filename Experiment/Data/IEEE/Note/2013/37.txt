This work draws upon the necessity oftesting and evaluating industrial robotic safety systems. With aplethora of existing collision avoidance methods (and many morecurrently in the pipeline), there is a clear and present need foran assessment basis to gauge speed and separation efficacy. Thispaper presents a comparative set of metrics based on separationdistance, sensor uncertainty, and robot velocity and mass. Toolsare provided for system performance and failure assessment. Applying the metrics directly, intelligent robot systems can recognizeunsafe operating conditions and respond accordingly. Postprocessanalysis of logs and calculated values identifies the conditions andcircumstances for which the safety of the system is at a minimum.
