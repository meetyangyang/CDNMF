Product returns in remanufacturing arehighly uncertain in quantity and condition, resulting in much variation in the set of operations (i.e., RPR) necessary to restore the returns to specifications. For instance, products that originally havethe same configuration may need different repair methods due tounpredictable structural changes or functional defects during theirutilization phase. Depending on the degree of damage, products,going through the same repair method, might need different iterations on certain operations. As these factors exist in a real remanufacturing cycle, how to effectively model and analyze the dynamics of RPRs becomes essential for remanufacturing production planning and control. This paper undertakes this challengeand develops four GERT-based RPR models that mathematicallyrepresent and analyze the behavior of remanufacturing operationsthrough probabilistic measures. More importantly, the relationships between those measures and other system parameters critical to production planning and control (such as inventory controlfor due-time performance and time buffer size for bottleneck control) are investigated through numerical examples. Given the importance of modeling and analysis in the design and operation ofremanufacturing, the key contribution of our research findings isthe four RPR models that, for the first time to the authorsâ€™ knowledge, explicitly consider the underlying uncertainty in remanufacturing and its impact to processing planning. The easy integrationof this development with other well-established inventory and bottleneck control models can successfully overcome a deficiency inthose existing control mechanisms that ignores remanufacturinguncertainty, thereby making the integrated method more applicable to real industrial settings.
