The scheduling method developed in this paper is designed for scheduling robots used in semiconductor production. The method is able to efficiently represent the state of the manufacturing system and uses this to find an optimal schedule to maximize productivity. The same approach can be used for other manufacturing systems with discrete events. The main advantage of this method is that it can fast find an optimal schedule based on the current state of the system. A long-time horizon can be used because of the high efficiency of the algorithm with respect to the number of jobs. However;  the method is best suited for manufacturing systems with few buffers and limited degrees of freedom;  in other words highly interconnected systems.
