With advances in information andsensing technologies, the past decade has witnessed an increasingly growing research interest on various aspects of degradationmodel-based prognosis from the observed signals by sensors. Thisis (at least partly) caused by its importance in a variety of fieldssuch as maintenance, inventory control, and public health surveillance and management. The current widely adopted degradationmodel-based prognostic techniques focus more on linear andobservable degradation process. However, the nonlinearity of thedegradation process existing extensively in practice cannot be ignored by the practitioners in degradation model-based prognosticpractice, especially for the case that nonlinear degradation datacannot be observed directly. Motivated by this observation, wepropose a prognostic model for hidden and nonlinear degradationprocess, and we summarize our main results in a few points: 1) ageneral nonlinear model with a state-space form is presented tocharacterize the hidden and nonlinear degradation process; 2) theanalytical form of the remaining useful life (RUL) distribution isobtained approximately, in which the uncertainty of the estimationfor hidden state is incorporated, and this leads to easy implementation and fast computation and thus is of practical significance;and 3) the real-time RUL estimation can be realized by reestimating the hidden state and the model parameters jointly by EKFand EM algorithm. Since we derive the general conclusion whichis free of the forms of nonlinear state function and observationfunction, the practitioner can choose some frequently used modelsand then compare the fitness with the actual data to determine thebest appropriate nonlinear model for RUL estimation. Overall, theapproach developed in this paper is a new prognostic techniqueand can be used to schedule maintenance activity and to evaluatefuture spare parts demand so as to mitigate the operating risk ofthe equipment in service.
