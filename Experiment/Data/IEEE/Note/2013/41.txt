In an industrial plant, alarms are designed to inform the operator about any fault or abnormality in the operation. However, alarm systems are not always designed, implemented, and maintainedproperly. This usually results in an excessive number of enunciated alarms,most of which are false or nuisance. Specifically, during a plant upset, operators receive far more alarms that they can handle (hundreds or eventhousands of alarms in a short period of time). This is known as an alarmflood or alarm shower. Our study shows that in some cases, alarm floodsfollow similar patterns. As a result by studying and classifying flood patterns, it is possible to find the root cause of an abnormality based on thehistory of the plant and previous similar floods. This allows the operator toreact to a plant upset at the early stages of or even before an alarm flood
