Firms worldwide;  responding to the threat of government legislation or to concerns raised by their own consumers or shareholders;  are undertaking initiatives to reduce their carbon footprint. It is the conventional thinking that such initiatives will require either capital investments or a switch to more expensive sources of energy or input material. In this paper;  we show that firms could effectively reduce their carbon emissions without significantly increasing their costs by making only operational adjustments and by collaborating with other members of their supply chain. We describe optimization models that can be used by firms to support operational decision making and supply chain collaboration;  while taking into account carbon emissions. We analyze the effect of different emission regulations;  including strict emission caps;  taxes on emissions;  cap-and-offset;  and cap-and-trade;  on supply chain management decisions. In particular;  we show that the presence of emission regulation can significantly increase the value of supply chain collaboration.
