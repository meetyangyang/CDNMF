The focus of the work in this paper isan application of a new process monitoring and fault diagnosismethod to an industrial cold rolling continuous annealing processline (CAPL). First, to make use of the knowledge on the divisionand sequence of process variables, in particular the knowledgeon sampling locations, a multilevel principal component analysis(MLPCA) is proposed for decentralized fault diagnosis. Secondly,the proposed diagnosis scheme is applied to the CAPL, whileprocess knowledge on the transportation of the feed material is considered to help interpret the fault due to defective raw materials.The multilevel diagnosis approach is recommended for industrial process monitoring and fault diagnosis of large scale sequential manufacturing processes. Particularly, the developed diagnosisscheme in a multilevel manner is recommended for complex processing units that can be decomposed into separate sections andsubblocks in sequence. The multilevel scheme is extended to a general fault diagnosis framework with more than three levels shouldthe process characteristics demand it.
