Automatically and accurately predictingthe stay time of mobile users at a location is very important in enabling service providers to offer their customers with the desiredservices. This work for the first time develops two novel predictionstrategies by using historical contextual information and the resulting STP system by using machine learning algorithms. Such asystem can be easily implemented in a smart phone that possessesthe GPS and other sensors. This work also examines such issues asprediction performance, memory requirements, and energy consumption of the developed system. The research results show thatit can be readily deployed for practical applications.
