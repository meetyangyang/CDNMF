Computer models built based on practicalsystems usually involve some unknown parameters that need tobe calibrated to improve the accuracy and predictive capabilityof the computer models. Take the new outbreak of the novel influenza A (H1N1) pandemic as an example. A disease transmissionmodel is built to simulate the spread of the virus in order to findthe best strategy to control its spread. Within this disease transmission model, the illness attack rate which is unknown in practiceneeds to be calibrated before the model can be used for analysis.One typical way is to calibrate manually. However, there is oftenlittle historical data for a new pandemic and manual manipulation of multiple input parameters in order to calibrate the modelto historical data requires fairly detailed knowledge of the model,including the code, limiting the capability for users to adapt themodel to new populations and diseases. Hence, an automatic calibration method is desirable to obtain an accurate attack rate thatcan quickly adapt and update the attack rate with new incomingdata. This paper proposes an automated approach based on SAthat can search for the optimum calibration parameter values accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, it also considers the effectsof randomness in the data and simulation on the calibrated parameters and provides an approach to quantify and account forthese uncertainties in the subsequent application of the calibratedmodel for prediction. This enables modelers and decision makersapplying calibrated simulation models to more accurately accountfor the overall uncertainty of the system to better assess the systemperformance.
