Motivated by a real automotive paintingshop, we consider the management of multiple energy systems inthis paper and pay special attention to the storage devices. The optimal scheduling is challenging due to the random fluctuation inboth the demand and the renewable power generation, the correlation among multiple systems, and among stages. We model thescheduling problem as a MDP and provide two approximate solution methods, namely, dynamic programming with value functionapproximation and mixed integer programming with mean valueapproximation. The second method is shown to provide good fastsolutions, and then is applied to optimize the capacity and to pickthe combination of the storage devices. We hope this work bringsinsight to energy savings in the automotive painting shop and can help practitioners to choose the appropriate storage devices and tobetter utilize the existing storage devices.
