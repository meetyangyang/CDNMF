This work is motivated by the demandfor optimal power management and control of distributed generators in a power network. Some of them rely on such renewableenergy sources as wind and the sun and thus exhibit high uncertainty in their power outputs. Existing studies focus on computingoptimal power flow without considering the uncontrollable generatorsâ€™ failure scenarios. This paper presents an optimal power flow(OPF) problem in which the failure conditions of distributed generators are considered in power networks, and swarm intelligencealgorithms to find its power output solution of controllable onlinegenerators. The work then shows how such algorithms can be usedon an IEEE 14-bus system when some generators break down. Future research should develop novel algorithms to solve OPF problems under generator-failure scenarios with time-variant powersources and apply them to large-scale power networks.
