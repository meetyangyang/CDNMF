-The decidability of any analysis of a reactive software (such as the correctness analysis) is guaranteed whenthe software possesses a finite-state equivalent model. A contribution of the paper is that it identifies a class of reactive software possessing such a property. Also, for a reactive software outside theidentified class, the paper presents an abstraction algorithm thatterminates with a finite-state equivalent model if and only if oneexists. Examples are presented to illustrate the results reported inthis paper.
