In an aging society, the cellular manufacturing system is difficult to be maintained. Accelerating the training process of the novice operators is the fundamental solution. In this paper, an assemblyskill-transferring method was proposed, which consists of three steps: 1) represents skills by the natural human language; 2) compiles skill candidates; and 3) selects skill based on the correlation. In this way, the assembly skills which the skilled operators and the novice operators lay different emphasis on can be extracted. Transferring these kinds of assembly skills can improve the novicesâ€™ assembly performance rapidly.
