Compared with the conventional articulated manipulators, a cable-driven robot has more obvious advantages in the energy consumption, operating speed, and movementsecurity. With these features, cable-driven manipulators are suitable candidates for humanoid arms to perform intrinsically safemanipulations. The main drawback of cable actuation is a reducedaccuracy, which must be fully compatible with the addressed environments and tasks. In this work, the kinematic calibration issueis presented to improve the motion control accuracy. It is realizedby the following two ways: (a) seven encoders are installed into thepassive joints to directly measure their angular displacement and(b) taking advantages of the redundant sensors employed in each ofthe modules, an integrated two-level self-calibration is conductedwithout using any external measurement instruments. The effectiveness of the proposed self-calibration algorithms is evaluated vianumerical simulation and experimental.
