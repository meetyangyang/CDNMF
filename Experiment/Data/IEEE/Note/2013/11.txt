Energy conservation becomes increasingly important for manufacturing plants. Instead of qualitative discussions, this paperdevelops a simulation based overall energy consumption estimation framework based on the energy analysis program EnergyPlus for certain manufacturing plants where the environmental conditions would not affect theenergy consumption of the production processes. The proposed frameworkcould help to quantitatively identify some energy conservation opportunities related to the facility and its climate control. Activated by the fact thatcurrently many industrial building designs do not incorporate energy efficiency and thus result in high building energy cost in the long run, thispaper also studies a building design problem minimizing the annual energy cost based on the overall energy estimation framework. Our method provides a tool that can be used relatively easily but generates satisfactoryresults.
