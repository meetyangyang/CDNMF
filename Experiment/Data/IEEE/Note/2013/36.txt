Failure detection is a crucial problem inautomation systems and received a lot of attention in the past fewdecades by researchers and practitioners. This paper is motivatedby the problem of fault diagnosis in real large systems that exhibit intrinsic distributed nature and non determinism. Hence, thepaper generalizes a previous fault detection strategy presented bythe authors in order to face two aspects of real systems: i) the nondeterminism caused by different events sharing the same sensorand ii) the distribution of the monitor and detection strategies byexploiting the modularity of the system and the growing communication fixtures. The system is modeled by Petri net modules thatshare information by some common places that are not influencedby non observable events. Future research aims at specifying distributed diagnosers able to perform fault detection in large systemswith more generic model settings.
