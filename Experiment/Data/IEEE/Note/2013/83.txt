This paper was motivated by an urgentissue on developing smart control to systemically and real-timelyhandles the problems of security, stability, and economical efficiency in present complex power systems. This paper suggests anovel two-level hierarchical hybrid control that consists of the logiccontrol strategies and the continuous controllers. The main contribution of this paper is to develop the upper level logic controlstrategies in an online manner based on information fusion technique of real-time dynamic information in order to switch controllable devices into apposite operational mode when there are largedisturbances occurring. Others rather contributions are to determine energy management strategies based on multiobjective optimization method, as well as to design lower level local controllersbased on multiple Lyapunov stability method incorporating linearmatrix inequality (LMI) techniques. The hybrid control is flexible and feasible for engineering applications. Preliminary simulationexamples indicate that this scheme is feasible but it has not yet beenincorporated into a real system nor tested in practical operations.In future researches, we will address the physical experiments ofthe proposed scheme and apply it into a real power system. Moreover, the hybrid control can be also extended to other complex hybrid systems, such as traffic and spaceflight systems.
