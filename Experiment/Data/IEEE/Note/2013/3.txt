- This paper develops an effective analytical tool to evaluate the performance of production systems with time-varying parameters of machine reliability. Using this tool;  production engineers and managers can predict the performance of the production systems in real-time with high accuracy. In addition;  based on this tool;  production operators can determine the machine startup and shutdown schedule based on the current status of the line and production requirement. Numerical experiments show that significant energy savings can be obtained by applying effective machine operations schedule.
