This work was motivated by the outstanding repetitive operation pattern and the high safety requirements of high-speed railways. By utilizing the repetitive operationfeature of a train, iterative learning control strategy is applied toimprove control performance by learning repetitive information.To avoid excessive speed, which is regarded as a severe unsafefactor for the high-speed train, an overspeed penalty is addedas a state constraint. To keep safe headway between adjacenttrains, the adjacent trainsâ€™ information is used to construct thecoordinated iterative learning control strategy. To further enhance the applicability, the corresponding control scheme undertraction/braking force constraint is also presented. In addition,this approach is a data driven model-free control method. Theabove method can also be applied to other repetitive operationsystems with state constraint, input constraint, or requirement ofcoordination operation. Although the feasibility and effectivenessof this ILC-based train control method has been proved throughthe rigorous theoretical analyses without requirement of the traindynamics model as long as some mild reasonable assumptions aresatisfied, and the simulation research as well, the field experimentshave not been carried out yet. In our future research, we will focuson this issue and address some other practical concerns, such asthe operation-depended uncertainties and disturbances in trainoperations.
