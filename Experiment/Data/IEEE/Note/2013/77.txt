Detecting system failures is essentialprior to any failure tolerance action. For stochastic discrete-eventsystems, the property of S-Diagnosability allows one to detectany system failure with arbitrarily small error bound and withinbounded delay. Thus, S-Diagnosability should first be assuredto enable the design of online detection scheme. This paper contributes by reducing the complexity and increasing the accuracyof checking S-Diagnosability properties.
