Production P&D are two important decision making levels for improving the production efficiency of mineral processing. Traditionally, the P&D problem are treated individually in the mineral process plant. However, the productionplan resulted in the higher level may be impracticable for scheduling in the lower level. In this paper, we establish a simultaneousmodel by mathematically characterize the production indicators (PIs, e.g., the concentrate yield, the concentrate grade, the concentration ratio, the metal recovery and the production cost) and conditions (e.g., limits for the equipment capacity, the energy resourceconsumption, the quality requirement and the raw material combination) with a different time scale to integrate both levels. Wedevelop a solution methodology based on two-level decompositionto optimize the indicators by generating overall plan in the upperlevel and feasible schedules in the lower level. We then show howthe proposed method can effectively provide efficient raw ore combinations for the DMs by the IP technique, and how the proposedhybrid algorithm can improve solution quality and speed. A casestudy suggests that the proposed approach can enhance the PIs andgenerate better feasible plans and schedules than a popular methodused in our earlier work. In future research, we will improve theproposed procedure for faster solution by parallel computationand incorporate it into a decision-making supporting system forthe DMs.
