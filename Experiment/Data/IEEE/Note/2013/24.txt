Kidney failure is increasing exponentiallyaround the world, so there is an urgent need to develop a systemthat is capable of blood filtration for the patients with kidneydisease. A MEMS-based hemofiltration system has been presentedhere that consists of four major parts like blood extraction/insertion, blood filtration, drug delivery, and electronic circuit. Thepresented hemofiltration system could be appropriate to filter theblood of the patients effectively due to accuracy, pain diminution,less side effects, ease of use, and controlled discharge.
