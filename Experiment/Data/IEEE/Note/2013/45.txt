Human breast tissue is by nature heterogeneous,and in the samples we studied, epithelial tissue is formed by groups of functional breast epithelial cells that are surrounded by stromal tissue in a complex intertwined way. Therefore, sampling a specific cell type on an unstained specimen is very difficult. To aid us, we use digital stained imagesof the same tissue annotated by a certified pathologist to identify the region of interest (ROI) at a coarse magnification and an image-guided positioning system to place the unstained tissue near the AFM probe tip. Usingour setup, we could considerably reduce AFM operating time and we believe that our setup is a viable supplement to commercial AFM stages withlimited X-Y range.
