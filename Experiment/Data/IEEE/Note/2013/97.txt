The designer of an RFID system with constantly moving tags faces the problem of assuring that every passing object is identified with very high probability (reliability). When several readers interfere with each other this problem is even more challenging because their inventory rounds (frames) must be multiplexed in time. We propose an efficient procedure to compute the reliability of the system, allowing a designer to determine not only the most suitable configuration, but also the operational limits of the system for a given reliability objective, e.g., the maximum velocity of the objects or the maximum number of tags per unit of length at each readerâ€™s coverage area. The model is limited to scenarios with constant physical parameters (velocity, trajectory, tag distribution, etc.).
