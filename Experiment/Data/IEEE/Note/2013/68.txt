We describe efficient and accurate algorithms for ray-shooting problem, i.e., finding the intersectionbetween a ray (a line emanating from a point) and a convex object.Its major applications in robotics include computation of thedistance between two convex objects and optimization of contactforces for multifingered grasping and multilegged locomotion.The algorithms are efficient because they employ geometry-basediterations instead of general-purpose numerical optimizationsuch as the active-set algorithm in MATLAB. They are accuratebecause we do not have to apply polygon approximation to objectshapes in distance computation or to friction cones in contactforce optimization. In distance computation, for example, this factmeans that we can directly use the parametric representation ofthe object surfaces such as NURBS.
