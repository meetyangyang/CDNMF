-UHF RFID systems with multiplereaders are commonly installed in many scenarios, where readersare placed in strategic places for checking specific areas. In thesescenarios, the reader interferences occur and they can degrade theperformance of our system. An efficient anticollision scheduler isnecessary for avoiding and minimizing these interferences, andthe current standards and regulations do not propose any efficientsolution. In this work, a new scheduler is proposed to get the bestperformance of a typical UHF RFID system with multiple readers.Our proposal is compatible with the global standard and thecurrent European regulations and is designed to be implementedin any commercial UHF reader in the market without extrahardware cost.
