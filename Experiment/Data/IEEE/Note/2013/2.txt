Semiconductor manufacturing facilities,also known as wafer fabs, consume a large amount of electricity indaily operation. Integrating renewable energy into the wafer fabsalleviates the greenhouse gas emissions, reduces the utility bills,and improves the energy security. We propose a grid-connectedDG system comprising wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, a netmetering module, and a substation. A quantitative approach is developed to guide the wafer fab to choose the energy technology andthe generation capacity, aiming to minimize the system cost, whilemitigating the carbon footprint.
