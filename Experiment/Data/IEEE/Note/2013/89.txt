Effective operation of straddle carriers is very important for container terminal managers to increase the productivity and reduce the operational cost of container transportation at automated terminals. This study develops a multiobjective model and an exact algorithm for the task allocation of container transportation using autonomous straddle carriers. Based on different optimization requirements, the optimal schedule and cost obtained by the presented multiobjective model and the exact algorithm can help the terminal operators to evaluate the performance of the operation of straddle carriers in terms of container transportation. The study can also provide an effective and flexible operational scheme for terminal managers.
