Industrial automation programming anddesign is still based on PLCs. Forty years after their introduction,they are still the most prevalent implementation platform for automation systems in many industries. After 1992, their success increased a lot with the introduction of IEC 61131 standard whichreduces the number of languages available on PLC platform. However, with the tools available in IEC 61131 it is not easy to developcomplex distributed control systems. This paper proposes the introduction of new software and methodological tools yet availablefrom industry and research to build control applications. This allows the synthesis of the controller from a formal definition of thecontrolled systemâ€™s behavior and from the control specification butat same time as much as possible IEC 61131 compliant.
