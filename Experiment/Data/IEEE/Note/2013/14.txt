Semiconductor manufacturing fabs tendto reduce wafer lot sizes, down to several wafers in a lot, and hencemake frequent lot changes. Furthermore, dummy wafers forcleaning or tuning chambers are often inserted between regularwafers. Nonetheless, most cluster tool scheduling works assumesteady production of identical wafers. We therefore need to havean efficient scheduling method that can handle frequent changesof wafer types and can minimize chamber idle times betweenwafer changes. Since the processing sequence between lots ispredetermined by a fab level scheduling system, we only need to schedule a new lot by considering the schedule of the preceding lotin progress. The prevalently used backward and swap sequences,which are known to be good for cyclic production of identicalwafers, cause deadlocks when two different wafer types are concurrently processed. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that thosesequences give optimal schedules when small lots are processedsequentially. Moreover, as compared with them, our proposedscheduling method can increase the throughput by about 5%â€“20%and hence the tool utilization as much. The proposed schedulingmethod may look complicated and difficult to implement and requiring a mathematical background. However, the whole processfrom modeling a Petri net for the scheduling problem to solvingthe scheduling problem and even to implementing the schedulein a tool controller can be automated. We already developed aprototype software tool for the purpose.
