The use of integrated UHF RFID technology embedded inside plywood could bring significant benefits to the plywood industry. At the moment, identification and tracking are done manually or by using bar codes on large shipments of plywood. Manual identification can lead to misreads and external bar codes are easily detached or damaged. In this paper, we propose a solution to directly inkjet-print RFID tags on veneer. After printing, they can be embedded inside plywood. As a result, individual plywood boards are identifiable and traceable during their whole lifetime, even in their end product form. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of passive UHF RFID technology in the plywood industry, explains the tag fabrication procedures and presents the measurement results of plywood-embedded tags. Results show that the tags are readable from several meters, even inside thick plywood boards. Thus, embedded RFID technology could be utilized by the industry as well as by the end users of plywood as an efficient and reliable automated identification method for plywood boards and plywood-made products.
