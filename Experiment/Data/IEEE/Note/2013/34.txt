This paper proposes a computationalmodel of object-based bottom-up visual attention for robots.This model can be used for several robotic applications, suchas detecting unusual objects, tracking unusual objects, objectrecognition, selection of landmarks, exploration of unknown environment, localization and mapping in the unknown environment,and human-computer interface. Compared with space-basedbottom-up visual attention model, this proposed object-basedmodel can achieve the complete object region and is robust tonoise and spatial transformations. The complete object region canprovide more information such as shape and size. The robustnesscan further guarantee the computational performance under avariety of conditions. Thus, this model has great advantages in avariety of engineering applications.
