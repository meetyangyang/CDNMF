This work was motivated by the need fora means for robots operating in unstructured environments to robustly grasp and manipulate a wide range of objects using a multipurpose hand. To date, one of the most difficult tasks for a general-purpose hand has been grasping small, thin objects, whichare typically found resting on a flat surface such as a table. Thesize of the object and the presence of the backing surface make itdifficult to establish contact with the object resulting in a stablegrasp. In previous work, we have shown how proper attention tothe passive mechanics of the hand, including mechanical compliance and underactuated differential transmissions, can enable robust, open-loop “power” grasping of large objects. In this paper,we extend the same concept to “precision” grasping of small objects with the same demonstrated robustness and simplicity.
