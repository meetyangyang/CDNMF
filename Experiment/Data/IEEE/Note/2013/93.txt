A modern manufacturing system requires the use of sensors and actuators whose quantity is largely decided by its supervisory controller. Clearly, more complex controllers imply higher overall implementation cost and failure probability. This paper proposes an effective method to reduce size and thus the implementation cost of a supervisory controller. In the Petri net model, each transition is associated with observation and control cost that represents the implementation cost of a sensor and an actuator at certain physical positions. A mathematical programming approach is proposed to effectively determine the controller with the minimum cost. It is applied to automated manufacturing systems (AMS) with complex operations. The experimental results prove its effectiveness and efficiency.
