-Consider a building in which the roomsare separated by sensors that detect crossings, such as turnstiles(or laser tripwires, pressure-sensitive floors, etc.). If the number ofoccupants in each room is known initially, it is easy to use the datafrom the turnstiles to keep the population of each room up-to-date.However, if the number of occupants in each room is not knowninitially, the data from the turnstiles can be used to determine thepopulation in each room. This paper approximates how long it willtake to accumulate the data needed to determine these populations.
