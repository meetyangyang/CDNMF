- This paper describes the method for stress-sensing using the thin layer Silicon-on-Insulator Field-Effect Transistors (SOI-FETs). This method is characterized with adjustable sensitivity and wide working temperature range and is expected to apply in strain gauges;  pressure sensors;  accelerometers;  and cantilever force/displacement sensors. In the paper we take the application in accelerometers for example. A structure of double-clamped beam with a mass at the center has been fabricated on the substrate of a SOI wafer. Based on the devices;  we have measured the characteristics of the sensitivity;  the noise floor and the working temperature;  which is critical in some applications such as military;  automobile;  nuclear;  and well-logging industry application.
