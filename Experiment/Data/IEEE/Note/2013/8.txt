This paper was motivated by the problemof remanufacturing of energy battery packs for electric vehicle application. The methodology and policy also apply to various industries where there exist end-of-life products with modular structureand great promise of reuse. Optimal control policies consideringboth assembly complexity and quality uncertainties have not beeninvestigated in an integrated framework in existing research. Inthis paper, we propose module substitution as an option during reassembly and make optimal decisions on the reassembly strategyfor fulfilling multiple classes of orders. The results of this workdemonstrate the benefits of jointly managing returned product inventories of various quality levels. For larger scale problems, twoheuristic policies are proposed for efficient and reliable solutions.Managerial insights from the results will help manufacturers tomake decisions on their remanufacturing and inventory systems.
