Due to their high speed and high dynamics, parallel manipulators have been recognized as goodcandidates to conduct 4-degree-of-freedom pick-and-place operations. However, how to design a suitable parallel structureis not an easy job. Up to now, only a few parallel manipulators(e.g., Delta and Quattro) have been successfully applied in real applications. A novel class of parallel mechanisms capable of thedesired motion is proposed, which have the simplest topologicalstructure. This paper shows that a parallel manipulator mayundergo a different motion type given a different joint axis layout.In order to utilize the workspace effectively, an approximationof the generated workspace to the prescribed regular workspacewould be desirable. The regular workspace share, the ratio ofthe prescribed regular workspace to the generated workspace, isproposed to measure the approximation. We thus optimally designa representative parallel manipulator, the 4- parallelmanipulator, by considering two design objectives, the regularworkspace share index and the global condition index. The optimization can produce multiple optimal solutions, which providesthe designers freedom of choice according to practical demands.
