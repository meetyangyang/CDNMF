In practice, engineers rigorously examinea constructed pallet system for a safe running and fulfillment ofrelated objectives. This examination demands a lot of time and effort and may show some defects that force them to redesign, reconstruct, and reexamine the system. These defects are occurredbecause current design and control strategies are not precise androbust enough to satisfy operation level objectives, as well as thesystem design specifications. To significantly reduce the defects andsave engineering times and costs, this paper provides a formal toolto characterize a robust control under which a cyclic pallet systemsafely and smoothly runs and gives a desired throughput. Moreover, the realized control is optimal and sustainable from this pointof view that it minimizes the force load on the system drive unit andenhances its lifetime.
