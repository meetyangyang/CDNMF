The LNM in hybrid and complex systemsprovided in this paper is easy to implement and potentially applicable for fault diagnosis in any complex system. This method isvery suitable where many different sensors and signals are considered, regardless of whether its nature is discrete, continuous, orboth. In this case, the method is implemented in a subsystem of awind turbine, showing the advantages and facilities of application.
