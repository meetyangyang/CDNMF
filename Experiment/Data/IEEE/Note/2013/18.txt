This work is motivated by the need toschedule complex semiconductor wafer fabrications. To find goodscheduling decisions under complex production constraints and toaddress the preference of performance criteria are always a bigchallenge for wafer fabrication managers. This paper presents asolution that consists of a simulator and a scheduler. The formercarries out virtual running of a fabrication plant to acquire necessary production data for scheduling decision generation. Withhelp of an advanced hierarchical model, various production activities, e.g., lot release, production routing, and machine repair, can bewell reflected in the simulator. Thus the authenticity and validityof data obtained can be guaranteed. The scheduler, which takes thesimulator as the performance evaluation support, can generate thesuitable scheduling rule combination involving both machine selection and lot selection. On practical demand, the proposed solutioncan be further updated due to the changing preference of performance criteria and/or expanded rule candidates.
