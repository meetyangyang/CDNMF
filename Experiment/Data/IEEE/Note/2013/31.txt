Most manufacturing industries havesought to maintain a desired productivity and quality whileneglecting energy consideration. Although many practitionershave realized the importance of improving energy efficiency,there was lack of a systematic method to enhance energy savingwithout negatively impacting productivity. The existing energysaving methods in practice are based on “trial and error” and thetrue impacts in terms of real energy savings and the influence tonormal production are difficult to quantify. This paper providesa systematic method for energy saving opportunity identificationduring production operation. Furthermore, practical strategiesof energy saving opportunities are provided through case studies.This quantifiable method utilizes measurable plant floor data foreasy implementation, validation, and improvement.
