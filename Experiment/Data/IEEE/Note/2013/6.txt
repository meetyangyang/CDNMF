-In robotic manufacturing systems, muchenergy is wasted due to an adopted minimum time policy for robotoperations. This paper presents a method for producing energy efficient operations as well as an optimization model for schedulingthese operations in a robot cell. Implementation requires a flexiblerobot controller which allows manipulation of speed and acceleration profiles. The results are also of interest to industrial robotmanufacturers, who have full control over the robot controller andwould like to offer energy efficient solutions to their customers.
