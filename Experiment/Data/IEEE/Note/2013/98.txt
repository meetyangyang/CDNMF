This paper was motivated by the problem of automatic recognition of physical human activities using on-body wearable sensors in a health-monitoring context. Three wearable sensors (accelerometers) are placed at the chest, the right thigh and the left ankle of the subject. The studied activities concern the static ones, the dynamic ones as well as transitions between those activities. Since the goal is to recognize human activities from only the raw acceleration data, the acquired acceleration signals are seen as multidimensional time series with regime changes due to the changes of activities over time. The activity recognition problem is formulated as a problem of multidimensional time series segmentation. Segmenting the time series according to different unknown regimes over time is equivalent to classifying the acceleration data into one set of activities; each activity being associated with a regime. The proposed approach does not require any annotation of the raw accelerations by experts to learn the model parameters. However, it assumes that the number of activities is known. This assumption can be a constraint in a context of exploratory data mining where the aim is to automatically cluster a large amount of data into different group of activities. To tackle this limitation, a selection criterion can be used to determine the number of the groups of activities.
