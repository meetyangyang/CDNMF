This work is a step towards the design ofan instrumented knee prosthesis which can provide the medicaldoctors with useful information about its condition and function.This information, including the forces and movements of theprosthesis, is crucially useful for early detection of defects such asligament imbalance, wear, any decreased range of motion whichmay need clinical action. Using the combination of kinematicand force data, researchers can provide clinicians with diagnostictools to detect defects or harmful wear, while there is still theopportunity to correct the gait patterns and avoid irreversibledamage to the prosthetic joint. In this study, the system includes aset of sensors that measure the forces and movements of the joint. To provide such a system, we designed a sophisticated sensorysystem, supplementary electronics to prepare the data to be sentout via wireless communication and powering units. In the currentpaper, we showed the preliminary results obtained in differentareas of this multidisciplinary research. The measurements ofknee rotations and force, via the designed measurement system,have been completed and showed satisfying accuracy. The components for transmitting power and reading the sensory informationhave been designed, simulated and are under fabrication. Incontrast to previous works on instrumented prostheses, where theprosthesis design was totally changed, our design just modifies apolyethylene part of the prosthesis. This feature makes our designflexible enough to be easily modified for any commercialized kneeprosthesis. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first workpresenting a simultaneous internal measurement of forces androtations in a knee prosthesis, while previous works only focusedon force measurements.
