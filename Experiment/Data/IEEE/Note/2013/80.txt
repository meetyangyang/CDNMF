This paper deals with the uncertaintymanagement problem of product disassembly. Based on suchuncertainty, this work establishes some chance constrained programming models for disassembly cost and proposes stochasticsimulation algorithms based on NN and GA-NN to solve them,respectively. Previously, such a problem is handled through amethodology based on probabilistic planning and expected valueanalysis, which is ineffective without considering the chanceproblem of completing a disassembly task. The goal of this workis to analyze the disassembly uncertainty feature from the perspective of chance constrained programming. Both theoreticaland simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approachcan perform effectively the quantitative analysis of a disassemblyprocess. Such results can help decision makers perform betterjudgments when a disassembly process of a used, returned, problematic and or obsolete product is executed.
