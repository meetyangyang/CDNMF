Most industrial products are complex assemblies made up of multiple manufactured products—organized as Bills-Of-Materials (BOMs)—that are produced in a shared manufacturing facility with possibly multiple functionally identical machines. There are a few rigorous approaches to deal with these kinds of problems in the literature. The job-shop scheduling problem has been extensively addressed, but these problems do not provide for any relationship between the multiple manufactured parts. In an assembly scheduling problem, the completion time of a child component becomes the release time of the parent part; hence, the multiple jobs become connected in a tree structure defined by the BOM. The second aspect that has been less considered in the scheduling literature is multiple, functionally identical machines—a common occurrence in industry. This paper takes on these two challenges and solves this problem using a LR approach and associated heuristics. Industrial strength problems of about 300 operations and 10 work centers are solved in a few seconds using this approach to near-optimality, while commercial strength mixed integer programming solvers are unable to find useful solutions in an hour.
