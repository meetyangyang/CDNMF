Traditionally, tactile sensing focuses onusing collocated tactile sensors to recognize objects. However, it isnot always practical to place tactile sensors at the location of contact. We demonstrate a new way to detect and localize surface features using the dynamical response of a robotic finger or sensor.This approach facilitates tactile object identification in scenarioswhere tactile sensors might not be practical.
