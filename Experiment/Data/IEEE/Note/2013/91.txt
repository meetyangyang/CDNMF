A blocking flowshop problem has important applications in plastic, steel, chemical, and many other industries. In the blocking flowshop, no intermediate buffer exists between machines due to technical requirements or the process characteristics, and the zero buffer setting is also different from no-wait setting for more than two machines. This paper aims to minimize makespan for the flowshop scheduling problem with blocking, which can lead to a high throughput, and it is very important in situations where a simultaneously received batch of jobs is required to be completed as soon as possible. We propose an effective memetic algorithm (MA) including advanced techniques like a heuristic-based initialization, a path-relinking-based crossover operator, a referenced local search, and a procedure to control the diversity of the population. The effectiveness of the proposed MA is demonstrated by extensive comparisons against the best existing methods for the considered problem, as well as with several adapted hybrid genetic algorithms originally designed for the regular flowshop problems. However, in some situations, setup times of machines and transporting times of jobs cannot be negligible. This work can be extended to these practical problems by considering the constraints in the objective function. In addition, the application of the proposed MA can also be generalized for other combinatorial optimization problems including no-wait flowshop problems, hybrid flowshop problems, flexible job-shop problems, and many others.
