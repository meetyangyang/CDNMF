To try and recover ground motion measurements from the on- accelerometer in a smartphone, one shouldtake into account the additional variables in the environment inwhich the measurement was taken. Such variables include that thedevice may be moved by the user rather than the ground, that theaccelerometer may record internal phone vibrations rather thanexternal effects, and that the absolute orientation of the devicecannot be determined from the accelerometer readings alone. Thisreport gives practical procedures and algorithms to address these newly introduced issues. We provide a three-step-loop procedureto only actively sense for significant ground motion when it isreasonably certain the phone is not in active use. We also give anumber of filtering techniques to apply to the raw accelerometersignal, such as isolating frequencies relative to seismic groundmotions, removing potential internal resonance of the device inthe output signal, and detecting whether a device has undergonesignificant disruption from forces not pertaining to ground motion.Since the cardinal direction (north-south-east-west) and coordinate location are needed to determine fault movement properties,we give a procedure to recover absolute position and absoluteorientation from a combination of accelerometer, compass, andGPS information. By comparing the performance of the devices’accelerometer readings against high-fidelity accelerometers onshaking tables, we demonstrate that the resolution of the devices’measurements show potential for ground motion estimation.
