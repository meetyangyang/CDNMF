Lithography is a major bottleneck insemiconductor manufacturing. This paper addresses the scheduling of litho machines and reticles over a day for high-volumeand low-variety lots to meet daily targets of different products. Ascheduling formulation with novel modeling of resource setups,reticle expirations, and future stacking layer load balancing ispresented. The problem is solved by using a standard commercialsolver that exploits problem linearity. Near-optimal schedules,however, are difficult to obtain efficiently for practical problems.Through detailed analyses, it was discovered that the difficultyis caused by certain constraints in the formulation. A two-phaseapproach is therefore developed. In the first phase, a simplifiedproblem with complicating constraints dropped is efficientlysolved to reduce ranges of decision variables. The problem withthe full set of constraints is then solved in the second phase witha much reduced decision space. This method can obtain near-optimal schedules for practical litho machine scheduling problemswithin reasonable amounts of computation time.
