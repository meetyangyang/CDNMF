The purpose of fault diagnosis in multistation assembly processes is to identify the root causes of thelarge dimensional variation of the assembled products, such asworn and/or malfunctioning fixtures. In real manufacturing environments, the number of sensors will frequently be less than thatof process faults. This scenario results in non-existence of a uniquesolution mathematically and thus creates an obstacle for faultdiagnosis. This paper developed a fault diagnosis methodologyby using the concept of sparse solution, which is consistent withthe engineering interpretation, i.e., the probability of less processfaults occurring is always higher than that of more process faults.With this method, even if the number of sensors is less than thatof process faults, the process faults can still be identified. This newapproach surpasses existing methods because even if only partialprocess/product information is available, the process faults related to the partial process/product information can also be identified.The developed methodology provides a highly effective tool offault diagnosis for quality engineers to solve dimensional qualityissues in large and complex manufacturing systems.
