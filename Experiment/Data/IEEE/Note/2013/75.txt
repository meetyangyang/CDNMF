Brachytherapy treats cancer by delivering radioactive sources proximal to cancer sites via needles.Current methods use standardized fixed mechanical templatesthat force needles into parallel arrangements that may preventneedles from reaching prostate volumes blocked by the pubic archand often require needles to puncture sensitive organs. Skew-line (nonparallel) arrangements of needles can reach targets under thepubic arch and avoid sensitive organs. However, these arrangements cannot be achieved with standard templates, motivatingthe use of automation. We present a human-centered automationsystem that integrates state-of-the-art needle and dose planningalgorithms with a modified needle insertion robot. Results suggestthat the robot can achieve precision and accuracy comparable tothat of expert human physician. This approach has applicationsto brachytherapy treatment for other organs and to other needleprocedures such as biopsy and anesthetic injection.
