Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities require dispatching rules with good operational performancewhen facing a changing and uncertain environment. This workproposes an adaptive dispatching rule (ADR) to satisfy such requirement. Its advantages are to link its own parameters with duedate of a job, workload of a machine, and occupation time of ajob on a machine; and to adjust its weighting parameters in termsof real-time system status information, e.g., the ratio of hot jobs towork in process (WIP) and the ratio of jobs with one third of photosteps left to WIP in a fab. Thus, it can tune its parameters over timeand is, hence, adaptive to a changing environment. The simulationresults based on a real fab validate and verify the effectiveness andadaptability of the proposed ADR. It can be readily deployed to apractical fab.
