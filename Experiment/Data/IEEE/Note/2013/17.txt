The research in this paper is motivated bythe following practical problems. After a failure occurs in a manufacturing system, can engineers determine the state of the systembefore the failure? If the output of a computer system is unexpected, can engineers go back to find the state of the system sometime before? The answers to these problems require that we findthe initial state of a system. The initial state in this context is interpreted generally as the state at some past time. Obviously, it isdesirable that engineers can always determine the initial state of asystem. However, depending on the nature of the system, this mayor may not be possible. If engineers can always determine the initialstate of a system after some finite observations, then the system isstrongly I-detectable. Strong detectability can be checked using thealgorithm proposed in this paper. We can answer the above questions in manufacturing and computer systems by checking strongdetectability. In some engineering systems, the initial state can bedetermined along some trajectories of the system, but not along alltrajectories of the system. We can use weak I-detectability to dealwith such situation.
