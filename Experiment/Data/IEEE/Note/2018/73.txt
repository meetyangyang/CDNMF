- Sharing economy is of great importance for realizing green consumption and sustainable development in our human society. Sharing economy enterprise calls for intelligent system design for service-demand matching in the current big data era. In this paper;  we design the accelerator based on ONoC to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. By processing computation tasks on parallel cores using our algorithm;  the task-core mapping can be performed with high speed and reliability. The simulation results - based on the trace file of Amazon Mechanical Turk - can well guide the practitioners to design a more clever and reliable product by quickly calculating the optimal service-demand matching.
