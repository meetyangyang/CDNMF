This paper presents a comprehensivesolution for integrating mesoscale ensemble weather forecastingin aviation aid, including probabilistic weather data analysis,mission (route) planning, and mission risk evaluation with simulations based on real data. This paper proposes a flexible andcomprehensive solution that is based on real mesoscale ensembleweather forecasting data with two different variables, which canbe easily extended and scaled to multiple variable cases. Theanalysis can integrate inputs from meteorologists, operators, andcommanders, so that the knowledge of experts from differentdomains can be combined to arrive at the decision best forrisk management of aircraft or systems. The proposed methodis generic and can be applied to various applications, such asmotion planning problems in the manufacturing process that areaffected by multiple factors.
