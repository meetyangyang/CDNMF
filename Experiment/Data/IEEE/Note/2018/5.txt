/i>—An SEA is developed by placing an elastic element into the actuator; this elasticity gives SEAs several unique properties including low mechanical output impedance;  tolerance to impact loads;  and passive mechanical energy storage;  which makes it suitable for human–robot interaction. The performance of existing SEAs is highly dependent on the stiffness of a single spring. To overcome the limitations;  a novel SEA with two-stage stiffness was proposed in our previous work. This paper suggests a continuous tracking control method for the proposed compliant actuator. Although the overall stiffness is discontinuous;  the transition between different control modes for two springs is smooth and automatically realized. Experimental results show that the output force of the actuator is bounded. In future research;  uncertainties in actuator dynamics will be considered;  such that system identification or calibration is not required.</p>.
