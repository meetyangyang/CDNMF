This paper focuses on the developmentof a site-specific sprayer solution. The developed device aimsto reduce pesticide application by spraying individual targetsspecifically by setting the diameter of the spraying according tothe shape and size of the target. The core of the paper is a detaileddescription of a spraying device able to change its sprayingdiameter according to the detected target. A working procedureto calibrate and validate such a device is included. We believethat such a device can be used in modern agriculture and can becombined with a robotic sprayer navigating autonomously alongcrop fields. Such a device will contribute to reduced pesticideapplication.
