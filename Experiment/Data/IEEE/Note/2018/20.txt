This paper was motivated by theproblem of calibrating a laser sensor and a positioning device(robot arm, CMM, etc.) in a robust and fast manner. Specifically,the calibration is to derive the transformation by aligning thesensors coordinate system to the positioning devices coordinatesystem. The proposed calibration procedure consists of two parts:manual data collection and automatic transformation calculation.During manual data collection, users only need to select fourdifferent data; whereby each data contains of two positions withthe same orientation. Then, the desired transformation will bederived automatically. The calibration is designed in an efficientand robust way whereby: 1) data collection is done using a simpleplanar disk placed in arbitrary orientations; 2) minimum humaninteraction required; 3) tolerant to noise in the sensor data;and 4) easy implementation by following a proven and standardprotocol.
