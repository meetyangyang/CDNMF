This paper introduces an automaticmethod for micromanipulation using visual information frommicroscopy. We design an automatic workflow, which consistsof: 1) self-initialization; 2) vision-guided manipulation; and3) assisted targeting, and demonstrate versatile deployment of the micromanipulator on a portable microscope camera setup.Unlike existing systems, our proposed method does not requireany tedious calibration or expensive setup making it mobile andlow cost. This overcomes the constraints of traditional practicesthat confine automated cell manipulation to a laboratory setting.By extending the application beyond the laboratory environment,automated micromanipulation technology can be made moreubiquitous and expands readily to facilitate field study.
