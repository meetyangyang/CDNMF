Robotic systems are increasingly used in logistics facilities, such as warehouses and container terminals. Nonetheless, achieving improved efficiency in this context poses several challenges in terms of real-time execution, coordinated resolution of robot conflicts, and adaptation to unpredictable events in operational environments. This paper examines a problem related to the coordination of a team of autonomous robots operating in a container handling facility, where containers need to be transferred from the storage area to a loading station. The considered topology involves containers arranged in lanes for efficient storage, but imposes limitations on the movement of autonomous robots. Such a topology is commonly found in container terminals where straddle carriers have to transfer containers from a storage yard to quay cranes or trucks and vice versa, but have limitations on moving on the same or even adjacent container lanes. To address this problem, we develop a novel method that efficiently assigns containers to robots and defines appropriate timings for collective coordination of robot movements. We illustrate that the proposed method provides very efficient results (within 5% from the optimal) for multiple configuration scenarios. Even more importantly, the method is suitable for real-time execution as it solves problems with hundreds of robots/containers within a few milliseconds; this further offers the ability for solution adaptation in dynamically varying environments, e.g., in situations of robot delays or breakdowns.
