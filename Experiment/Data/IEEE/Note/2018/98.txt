Detecting system failures is essential prior to fault mitigation. For stochastic discrete-event systems, the property of stochastic diagnosability (S-Diagnosability) allows one to detect any system failure with arbitrarily small error bound and within bounded delay. This paper contributes by revising and extending the results in the previous work by Chen et al., 2013, regarding the verification of S-Diagnosability.
