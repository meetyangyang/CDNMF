This paper was motivated by the need of implementing multichannel profile detection for Raman spectra to realize in-line process monitoring and quality control of continuous manufacturing of carbon nanotube (CNT) buckypaper. Existing approaches, such as the mixed-effects model or the smooth-sparse decomposition method, cannot separate defective information in random effects effectively. This paper develops a penalized mixed-effects decomposition which decomposes Raman spectra into four components: fixed effects, normal effects, defective effects, and signal-dependent noise, respectively. The first three components can be applied to monitor the fabrication consistency, degree of uniformity, and defect information of buckypaper, respectively. With this new approach, several quality features can be monitored simultaneously and the algorithm based on the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method can satisfy the computation speed requirement of in-line monitoring. This paper provides a solid foundation for in-line process monitoring and quality control for scalable nanomanufacturing of CNT buckypaper. Furthermore, the developed methodology can be applied in the decomposition of other signal systems with fixed, normal, and defective effects.
