Manufacturing systems are facingincreasing pressure to reduce energy consumption, as globalcompetition, sustainability, and green processes are becomingmore prevalent. Although most of the research efforts on manufacturing energy saving have focused on developing individualenergy efficient machines, it can be more cost-effective to improveenergy efficiency through better control of the energy usage ofthe whole production system. Therefore, this paper presents asystematic method to improve system energy efficiency with aminimal negative impact on production. This paper continues thework by Chang et al. by extending the scope of energy savingopportunity theory from serial production systems to generalserialâ€“parallel production systems. It also develops analyticalmethods based on Markov chain models to estimate the energysaving opportunity accurately.
