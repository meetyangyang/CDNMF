Electroplating and chemical surface treatment lines with automated material handling hoists are commonplace in electronics, semiconductor, and many other manufacturing industries. In an uncertain environment, hoist rescheduling plays an important role in improving the productivity and reducing the impact of disruptions. This paper presents a hoist scheduling algorithm to deal with dynamic job arrivals by considering the impact of the disturbance incurred by rescheduling. Our algorithm can generate a better schedule with smaller total completion time and slighter disturbance than the existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm runs in polynomial time and can be used to control hoist operations in practical electroplating lines. A comparative analysis provides useful insights on the implementation of rescheduling approaches and policies to industry practitioners.
