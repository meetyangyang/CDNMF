This paper describes an approach to control and to automate dexterous precise positioning systems based on multiaxes piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). Two problems have motivated the approach investigated in this paper: 1) the presence of nonlinearities (hysteresis and creep);  of badly damped vibration and of cross couplings in the multiaxes PEAs and 2) the lack of convenient sensors to feedback control them. Therefore;  this paper proposes multivariable and complete feedforward control approach that does not require external sensors. This sensorless control architecture permits a low-cost and a high integration feature additionally to the fact that it is of great interest in applications at small scales where implementation of real-time measurement system is often difficult.
