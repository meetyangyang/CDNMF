Studying the Zebrafish larva as a modelorganism, is very useful in developmental biology, toxicology, andpharmacological testing—due to the similarity in the responseto various drugs, easiness of breeding, high throughput, lessercost involved, in vivo testing, and reduced bioethical concerns.The traditional approach of manually counting the heart beat ofthe larvae kept under a microscope is tedious. Automating theprocess using videos of the larvae placed under a microscopeis therefore important. The existing approaches are either notcompletely automatic or involve expensive equipment and/ormodifying the larvae (biological intervention) such that the heartexpresses fluorescence protein, and are not designed to handleeven minor motion. We consider completely automating theprocess of estimating the heart rate from nontransgenic zebrafishlarvae—avoiding any kind of manual intervention. The solutionto the preceding lies in automating: 1) the determination ofthe ROI that adapts to the location and size of the larvae, camera zoom, and image resolution; 2) the tracking of the ROIto handle drifting larvae; and 3) estimation of HR throughappropriate signal processing, to add to the robustness of themethod, including the handling of mild motion. We present acompletely automatic and robust HR estimation algorithm, whichworks automatically to estimate an adaptive ROI, followed byindependent component analysis. The method works even inthe presence of minor motion of the larvae, including drift.We plan to extend this paper to studying heart rate variability—an important method of quantifying the neural control of thecardiovascular system as well as identifying several pathologies—and certain types of arrhythmia.
