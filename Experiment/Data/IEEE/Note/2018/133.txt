This paper is motivated by the issue of controlling a crane system when double-pendulum swing effects are excited and present. The double-pendulum effects can happen in many practical scenarios and make the crane manual operation very challenging. Moreover, most existing crane control approaches are developed based upon single-pendulum crane models and they may not work normally in the presence of the double-pendulum phenomenon. In addition, usually, the model parameters, including rope length and trolley/hook/payload masses, are not exactly known in practice, which may badly degrade the performance of the control approaches requiring exact model knowledge. Toward this end, we suggest a new control method for cranes suffering from double-pendulum effects to achieve satisfactory performance. The presented control method is robust against parametric uncertainties and it can suppress the double-pendulum swing, reduce the trolley overshoots, and improve the efficiency. Preliminary physical experiments carried out on a double-pendulum crane hardware test bed indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In our future work, we will apply the suggested control approach to industrial crane systems to improve their working efficiency.
