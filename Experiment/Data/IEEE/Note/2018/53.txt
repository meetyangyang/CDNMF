This paper suggests a novel trajectoryplanning approach for dynamic and uncertain environments.Existing planning approaches generally deal with uncertaintiesby performing collision checks using enlarged bounding shapesfor the given confidence levels, which are conservative and tendto compute less optimal trajectories or fail to find feasibletrajectories. In this paper, we suggest a new collision probabilityapproximation of a robot and obstacles. Our approach guaranteesthat the computed probability is an upper bound on the actualprobability. We then present a trajectory planning algorithmbased on our probabilistic collision detection, and a practicalbelief space estimation algorithm. In our experimental results,we demonstrate that our approach can compute more efficienttrajectories than the prior approaches, while our approach hasa similar level of safety. Our experiments assume Gaussiandistributions for the environment uncertainties, and we willextend our algorithm to non-Gaussian distributions in futureresearch. Recently, we have extended our approach to generalconvex polytopes and improved the speed and accuracy ofthe collision probability computation using bounding volumehierarchies.
