During precision fingertip grasps, adaptive hands tend to move the object upon contact, to an equilibrium configuration determined by the elasticity of the mechanismand the forces exerted on the hand-object system. Such a behaviormay be undesired for certain tasks (e.g., when grasping a fullglass of water, the in-hand object perturbations may spill thewater). In this paper, we propose a methodology for adaptivehands that derives stable minimal effort grasps, computes thepost-contact parasitic object motions, and eliminates them usingcompensatory motions of a robot arm.
