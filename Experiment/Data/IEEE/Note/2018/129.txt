This paper presents an algorithm to solve a difficult class of bimanual manipulation planning problems where a movable object can be moved only when grasped by two robots. This problem arises naturally when manipulating a large and/or heavy object such as a piece of furniture and is therefore essential to industrial automation. The algorithm first precomputes a certificate, a set of robot motions to move the object between different placement classes that helps guarantee that the algorithm will find a solution to any planning query whenever one exists. This certificate is then used to quickly construct a solution trajectory to a planning query and can be reused under the same environment. The algorithm has been empirically verified through software and hardware experiments on a number of large pieces of furniture. An open-source implementation is provided.
