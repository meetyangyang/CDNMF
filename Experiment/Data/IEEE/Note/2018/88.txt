Here we consider a practical metrologyproblem encountered in semiconductor manufacturing, namely,design of a wafer measurement plan where measurements haveto be taken from several sites across a wafer surface in order tomonitor the accuracy and spatial consistency of a given processing step. A methodology is presented for designing a dynamicmeasurement plan for this scenario that minimizes the numberof sites that need to be measured while maintaining an acceptablelevel of process visibility in terms of wafer profile reconstructionaccuracy and the ability to detect previously unseen processbehavior. Our approach can significantly reduce the numberof sites that need to be measured on each wafer enablinggreater throughput on metrology tools. While developed for wafermetrology in semiconductor manufacturing, the methodology canpotentially be applied to the design of measurement plans for anysurface whose variation exhibits strong spatial correlation.
