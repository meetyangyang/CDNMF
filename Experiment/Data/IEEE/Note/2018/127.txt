This paper is motivated by the problem of allocating dry bulk materials in the stockyard of a small import terminal. In current approaches for allocating materials, the storage capacity cannot be considered, and this could lower the terminal profit resulting from delaying the vessel in the terminal when a finite storage capacity is considered. This paper suggests a new approach from a hybrid system perspective that captures the dry bulk terminal operation dynamics. In this paper, we mathematically describe the process of allocating materials into different slots in the stockyard using a hybrid dynamical model and propose a model predictive controller to maximize the terminal operation profit. We then show how the slot size influences the economic performance and analyze its associated computations by conducting simulation experiments involving a case study. Simulation experiments also suggest that this approach achieves significantly more economic benefits compared with current approaches. In future research, a large intermodal terminal will be investigated whereby incoming and outgoing materials of different transport modalities need to be coordinated properly.
