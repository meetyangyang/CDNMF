Failure prediction is a topic of greatinterest in various industry sectors. Predicting these events ischallenging not only because of the advanced techniques involvedin signal processing but also the availability of these signalswith proper quality. Specifically in the aeronautical industry, theavailability of signals for failure prediction may rely on in-flightdata transmission systems. The usage of such systems can leadto prohibitive costs when transmitting large quantities of data.As a consequence, most commercial aircraft monitoring systemscan only send a small set of failure messages indicating that thesystems are failed or, in some cases, that they achieved an intermediate degradation level. This paper proposes an adaptation of a state-of-the-art failure prognostics algorithm (particle filter)that uses intermediate degradation messages to predict failureinstants. The method is tested with real commercial aircraft dataand the impact of the number of intermediate degradation levelsis analyzed.
