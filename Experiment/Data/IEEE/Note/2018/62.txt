This work deals with a sequence modeling and planning problem of product disassembly. It establishes anovel dual-objective optimization model for product disassemblysubject to multiresource constraints. Previously, such a problemis handled through a methodology based on the optimizationof a single objective, i.e., disassembly time or cost. The resultant solution is insufficient without fully considering disassembly resources, e.g., labors and tools. Also, in an actual disassemblyprocess, a decision-maker may want to maximize disassemblyprofit, as well as minimize disassembly time. This work considers both objectives and proposes scatter search to solve disassemblyproblems. The results demonstrate that the proposed approachcan solve them effectively. The obtained solutions give decisionmakers some desired choices to select a right disassembly processwhen an actual product is disassembled.
