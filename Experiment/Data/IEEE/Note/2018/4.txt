The main motivation behind this papercomes from the very need for automatic positioning of objectsinside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to perform dynamicanalysis and structural characterization. Mostly, the positioning tasks are exhibited by skilled operators via teleoperation.Nevertheless, it is still a difficult task to repeat, and henceautomatic strategies are indispensable. This can be tackled upto an extent using microscopic vision information. However, theregular vision-guided strategies with integrated feature trackingare hard to use with SEM due to multiple instabilities associatedwith the imaging process. To address this issue, this paperpresents an image frequency-based positioning stage controllerthat does not require any visual tracking and is capable ofdealing with electronic images provided by SEM for automaticnanopositioning. The presented results illustrate the capability ofthe method to handle various perturbations and demonstrate itsperformance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and repeatability.Due to the existence of orthographic projection, the proposedmethod is limited to control depth displacements. This can beresolved by combining it with visual servoing-based autofocusmethods.
