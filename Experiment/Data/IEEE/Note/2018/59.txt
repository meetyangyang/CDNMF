To ensure higher product quality andsafe operation of batch process, process monitoring has becomean essential issue in the manufacturing process of a great dealof modern industrial plants. This study hence presents a novelmonitoring method for complex batch processes with frequentoperation characteristics. The present method can model strongnon-Gaussian distribution data. For complex batch processeswith frequent operations, the data follow serious non-Gaussiandistribution due to random operations. Multiscale neighborhoodnormalization method is proposed to transfer non-Gaussian distribution data to Gaussian distribution so as to build multivariatestatistical model. When online monitoring, the method showsfast model matching speed. Meanwhile taking into account thedynamic characteristics of the process, the MDPCA method ischosen to establish the model. Experimental results show thatthe present monitoring method can get higher detection rates,lower false alarm rates and shorter delays of fault capture thanthe conventional method.
