Gaussian mixture model HMM(GMM-HMM) is an efficient and easy-to-implement tool formode identification of dynamic industrial processes. These virtuesof GMM-HMM mainly come from the use of Gaussian emitting distribution, which allows closed-form derivatives to becomputed for the expectation and maximization (EM) estimation of mode parameters. The main novelty of the proposedcopula mixture model HMM (SPCMM-HMM) is twofold; itsemitting distribution also belongs to the exponential family, thusenabling efficient estimation of parameters through an exactEM procedure; meanwhile, it is also capable of characterizing complex dependence structures among process variables.However, the proposed SPCMM-HMM has more model parameters compared with the GMM-HMM. It excels in situationswhere the operation of the process system being monitored ishighly integrated (with complex process variable interactions)and abundance of training data samples is available. In thispaper, the interactions between process variables in both casestudies are complex due to the implementation of multiple closedcontrol loops, and a large amount of training data samplescan be easily generated from simulation. The performance ofthe SPCMM-HMM is shown to be consistently better thanthat of the GMM-HMM under such settings, which are fairlycommon in modern industrial processes. Nonetheless, if theprocess system being considered is only designed for a simpleoperation or there is a scarcity of training data samples, theGMM-HMM is still the preferred method as it is less prone tooverfitting.
