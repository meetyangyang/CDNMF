This paper addresses the problem ofmotion planning and control for automation of surgical tasks.In surgical tasks, it is necessary to manipulate objects underconditions where positions or shapes of objects often changeduring the task. Thus, trajectories for surgical tasks need to beplanned and updated according to the change in the conditionsin real time. In this paper, we propose a framework for learningboth spatial motion and force profile from human experts. Theproposed system can plan and update task trajectories in realtime and robustly control the contact force under dynamicconditions. On the other hand, generalization of trajectories islimited to the conditions, which are close to the conditions wherethe demonstrations were performed. In the future work, we willinvestigate reinforcement learning approaches in order to enableautonomous improvement of the performance.
