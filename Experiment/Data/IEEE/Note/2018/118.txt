This paper was motivated by the current deficit to automate maintenance tasks in manufacturing systems. Today there exist many automatic methods for fault detection, but there is no possibility to restore the desired state. A typical application is the replacement of a defective component or service tasks such as refilling of cooling lubricant in machine tools. The focus of this paper is to provide automatic planning concepts for robot systems which deal with this problem. For this, a task planning algorithm is proposed which uses CAD and vision data. The advantage of this method is that it works on a contact analysis, based on a discrete approximation of the disassembly space, allowing a fast determination of possible robot manipulations. Also, a new preprocessing concept for path planning is developed which enables the adaptation of the stepsize of the path planner, based on the local occupancy of the environment. Through this, it is possible to drastically reduce the required planning effort.
