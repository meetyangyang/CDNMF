Once a grasp of a given object has beenchosen, our method has multiple possible applications. First, itcan be used to determine how the choice of a preload (i.e., thetorques applied to the joints as the grasp is created) affects thestability of the grasp. Second, once a preload has been chosen, ourmethod can be used to determine which external disturbances canbe resisted solely through passive effects, without further changesto the commands sent to the motors. We believe this approachis particularly relevant for the large family of grasping devicesthat are not equipped with tactile or proprioceptive sensors, andare thus unable to sense external disturbances or to control jointtorques, but are still effective thanks to passive resistance effects.
