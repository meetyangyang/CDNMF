This paper was motivated by the problem of improving the control performance for the doubly fedinduction generator (DFIG). Because of its advantages, suchas high energy efficiency, low acoustic noise, variable speedoperation, and reduced converter rating, DFIG has emerged asa promising solution for the wind power generation. However,existing DFIG controllers have limitations, such as difficult totune the parameters, inefficient to handle constraints, and donot consider the discrete operation of the power converters.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a newDFIG control scheme based on finite-control-set model predictivecontrol (FCS-MPC), which has the abilities of online optimalcontrol, explicitly handling constraints, and directly generatingthe switching signals for the power converters. A computationallyefficient algorithm is proposed to reformulate the FCS-MPCproblem as a linear program, thereby significantly reducingthe computational efforts and rendering the proposed schememore practical for implementation. Simulation results validatethe effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. This schemecan be implemented in the field-programmable gate array, whichwill be our future work.
