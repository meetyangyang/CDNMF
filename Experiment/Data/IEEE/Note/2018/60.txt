The study finds the optimal processparameters for the grinding of hardened mold steel in ananofluid/ultrasonic atomization minimum quantity lubricationsystem. At present, grinding hardened mold steel is a costlyand time-consuming undertaking, because it lacks an efficientlubricating method. The study considered grinding force ratio,grinding temperature, and surface roughness as single-qualitycharacteristics for gray relational analysis and fuzzy inferenceto calculate multiple performance characteristic indexes. Theseindexes identified the optimal parameter combination for grinding hardened mold steel. The results suggested that the proposedlubrication system is highly effective in this regard.
