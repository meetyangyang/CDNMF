While looking for ways to improvethroughput and increase efficiency in nondestructive imagingapplications, the NonDestructive Testing and Evaluation Groupat the Los Alamos National Laboratory decided to take a lookat automation opportunities. Digital radiography and computedtomography are time-consuming processes, making them idealcandidates for robotic solutions. Radiography applications oftenrequire several images to be acquired from different angles anda lot of time they have to be very precise so that the featureof interest is identifiable and the resulting image meets theclientâ€™s requirements. With the robot acting as the motion controlsystem, the imaged part can be placed directly in the beam pathand oriented in six degrees of freedom. The robot can achievesignificantly higher levels of precision than a human and has the ability to adjust the part while the source is active. The systemalso reduces levels of radiation our staff is exposed to, as the robotis setup to handle radioactive and hazardous parts. Not only doesthe robot move parts more precisely and with higher resolutionthan humans, but it also adds additional flexibility in the typeand nature of images that the lab can produce. Future work willinvolve using this system for advanced automated scans such asachieving evenly spaced views around a sphere autonomously,since this system has not yet been used for more advanced scansbeyond helical scanning. A tightly linked feedback loop betweenthe robot and imaging code in which the imaging code wouldautonomously communicate to the robot what additional viewsare needed to reduce imaging error can also be explored.
