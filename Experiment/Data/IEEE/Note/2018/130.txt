This paper is motivated by the redesign of helicopter cowling of a Canadian aircraft company using concepts of design for assembly. Though we could reduce the number of parts using advanced composite materials and manufacturing processes, obtaining a feasible assembly for the new assembly structure required a lot of computation time. Hence, the researchers studied the existing literature on assembly sequence generation methods and their limitations, and came up with efficient automated optimal sequence generation method.
