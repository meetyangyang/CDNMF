A multiagent system evolution as continuum deformation is a novel idea for avoiding interagent collisionand collisions of agents with obstacles, while a capability tomanage large deformations (expiation or contraction) is provided.This idea becomes more interesting if deviations of agentsfrom desired positions defined by continuum deformation vanish during evolution when agents only access neighboring agent stateinformation.
