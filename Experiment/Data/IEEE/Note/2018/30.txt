Currently, construction project planningdoes not explicitly consider safety due to a lack of automatedtools that can identify a planâ€™s safety level before its execution.This paper proposes an automated construction safety assessmenttool which is able to evaluate the alternate construction plansand help to choose considering safety, cost, and deadlines.Our methodology uses discrete-event modeling along with motionplanning to simulate the motions of workers and equipment,which account for most of the hazards in construction sites.Our method is capable of generating safe motion trajectories andcoordination policies for both humans and machines to minimizethe number of collisions. We also provide safety heatmaps as aspatiotemporal visual display of construction site to identify riskyzones inside the environment throughout the entire timeline ofthe project. Additionally, a detailed sensitivity analysis helps tochoose among plans in terms of safety, cost, and deadlines.
