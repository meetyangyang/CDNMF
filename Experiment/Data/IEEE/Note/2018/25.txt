In this paper, we tackle the problemrelated to temperature measurement in microfluidic devices,especially but not only concerning cell culture environments. Eventhough it would be desirable to place a temperature sensor asclose as possible to the location of interest, practical limits usuallyprevent this; for instance, limited space and requirements foroptical monitoring. To overcome these problems in microfluidicdevices, we present a novel indirect temperature measurementapproach using the system identification method. The idea is tocreate a model that estimates temperature on the area of interestusing measured outside temperature. Because it is required tomeasure both model input and output signals for the modeldevelopment, we first fabricated a temperature sensor plate,combined it with our heating system, and measured required temperatures on several experiments. Then, we developed third-orderdiscrete state-space models using measured temperatures andSystem Identification Toolbox in MATLAB. Model performanceswere examined and compared with measurements. Furthermore,we created a closed-loop Simulink (from MATLAB) model, andshowed how desired temperature could be controlled using onlymeasured outside temperature and the developed model. In thefuture research, we will implement the designed closed-loopsystem to our cell culture system to precisely control temperaturein the cell area.
