Though directly applicable to general business process discovery, this paper is motivated by our collaboration with the company HEVA (Lyon, France) and health practitioners on patient care pathway discovery. The French hospitalization database that contains hospitalization history of all patients is used for this purpose and our goal is to determine the most meaningful process model of the patient hospitalization history. The hierarchical event structure of this paper provides a natural way of representing relationship between hospitalization events and is readily obtainable from the classical ICD-10 codes. The formal mathematical model and our optimization algorithm allow the end users to best balance between the faithfulness of the process model and its complexity. A case study of cardiovascular patients is presented to show the capability of the proposed approach to clearly capture the major patient pathways before and after the implementation of defibrillators. The results of this paper are highly valuable for doctors and public health decision makers, as crucial information is provided on patient care pathways for any selected cohort.
