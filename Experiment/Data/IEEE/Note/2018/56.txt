Fabric defect detection is central toautomated visual inspection and quality control in textile manufacturing. This paper deals with this problem through a learningbased approach. By opposite to several existing approaches forfabric defect detection, which are effective in only some typesof fabrics and/or defects, our method can deal with almost alltypes of patterned fabric and defects. To enable both detectionand localization of defects, a fabric image is first divided intolocal blocks, which are representative of the repetitive patternstructure of the fabric. Then, statistical signatures are calculatedby modeling the distribution of coefficients of an RCT usingthe finite MoGG. The discrimination between defect-free anddefective fabrics is then achieved through supervised classificationof RCT-MoGG signatures based on expert-labeled examples ofdefective fabric images. Experiments have shown that our methodyields very good performance in terms of defect detection andlocalization. In addition to its accuracy, inspection of imagescan be performed in a fully automatic fashion, whereas onlylabeled examples are initially required. Finally, our method canbe easily adapted to a real-time scenario since defect detectionon inspected images is performed at the block level, which canbe easily parallelized through hardware implementation.
