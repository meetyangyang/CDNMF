In the proposed method, extrinsic calibration parameters can be estimated during the localization process without any initial manual precalibration procedure. Besides, an IMU is small and inexpensive, so small AGVs in warehouses, or mobile manipulators in factories are good applications for the proposed method, where they require a certain level of localization accuracy. The localization module using the proposed method can be mounted anywhere in a robot without restrictions. The initialization procedure has been executed for a few seconds with arbitrary movement in the field of view of the first frame, then the initial gravity and velocity vector, and extrinsic parameters, which are estimated during the initialization phase, are applied to a general SLAM problem.
