Wafer processing of circuits with extremely small circuit widths is subject to contamination by residual chemicals within chambers. Therefore, in leading fabs, 50%âˆ¼80% of cluster tools for etching, wafer cleaning, chemical vapor deposition, and physical vapor deposition processes clean chambers each time a wafer is processed. Such cleaning operation complicates tool operation and hence makes conventional scheduling rules inefficient. Our proposed simple modifications of the conventional backward sequence significantly improve the throughput rate of cluster tools. They are easy to implement.
