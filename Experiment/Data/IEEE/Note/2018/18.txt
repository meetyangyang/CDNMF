Data-defect inspection is an importantprocedure of data preprocessing for a real industrial process.This paper presents a data-defect inspection method withkernel-neighbor-density-change outlier factor to identify theoutliers, and addresses the challenges associated with thestrong correlation and the nonlinearity of the industrial data.The proposed method calculates the outlier factor for each object,which quantifies how outlying it is. The outlier factor is basedon the density difference between the object and its neighbors. The larger the outlier factor of an object is, the higher the outlierness of the object is. The proposed method could be wildly usedin an industrial complex data set with different density regions.In the industrial field, engineers can deal with the objects withhigh outlier factor values based on the actual requirements.
