The amount of discarded electronic waste (e-waste) is increasing rapidly, yet efficient, nondestructive, automated methods to handle the waste have not been developed. Many e-waste products such as laptops use fasteners that need to be removed. In this brief, we focus on removing screws from laptops in a nondestructive manner in order to not damage the laptop, so its parts can be recycled. Due to the vast amounts of laptop models, it is necessary to create a method that will automatically recognize the locations of these fasteners. This brief presents a prototype robotic system that integrates force and vision sensing to automatically locate and remove screws from various models of laptops. The methodology presented in this brief is applicable to other e-waste products with a casing attached by screws. A current limitation of this brief is the robotic system that has to investigate all potential hole locations found by the vision system, although some of these locations may not correspond to valid screw locations. This brief can be extended to include a memory feature that will remember the locations of the screws for cases with similar laptops that are handled by the system to improve the processing time.
