This paper proposes an algorithm tosolve a geometric problemâ€”find whether a given formation ofplanar points can constrain (or cage) a planar shape. Users canuse the proposed algorithm to actuate a formation of roboticfingertips to perform caging-based grasping tasks or use theproposed algorithm to actuate a formation of mobile robots toperform cooperative transportation tasks. The algorithm inheritsthe merits of caging and helps users to avoid explicit forceanalysis. It offers robustness to avoid uncertainty in the tasks.The code of our work is in the supplementary material.
