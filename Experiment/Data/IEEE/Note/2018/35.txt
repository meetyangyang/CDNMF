In this paper, the problem of humanbalance control assessment is analyzed through the segmentation of the multidimensional time series of the center ofpressure (CoP) displacement measurements during orthostaticpostures of healthy and Parkinsonian subjects. The proposedmodel for automatic temporal segmentation is a specific statisticallatent process model that assumes that the observed stabilometricsequence is governed by a sequence of hidden (unobserved)states or conditions. More specifically, the proposed approach is based on a specific multiple regression model that incorporatesa hidden Markov process that governs the switching from onecondition to another over time. The model is learned in anunsupervised context by maximizing the observed data loglikelihood via a dedicated expectationâ€“maximization algorithm.We applied it on a real-world automatic CoP displacementexcursion segmentation problem and assessed its performance byperforming comparisons with alternative approaches, includingwell-known supervised static classifiers and the standard HMM.The results obtained are very encouraging and show that theproposed approach is quite competitive, though it works in anentirely unsupervised fashion and does not requires a featureextraction preprocessing step. The present findings could helpclinicians to better understand the motor strategies used by thepatients during their orthostatic postures and may guide therehabilitation process.
