Distinguishers and approximations are alternatives to simplify modeling and reduce synthesis cost in SCT, grounded on the idea of event-refinements. However, this approach may entangle the modular structure of a plant, so that LMC does not keep the same efficiency. This paper shows how distinguishers and approximations can be locally combined such that synthesis cost is reduced and LMC advantages are preserved.
