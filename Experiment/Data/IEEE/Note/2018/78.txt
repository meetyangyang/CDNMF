This paper is motivated by the problemof monitoring and diagnosis of compound faults in rollingbearings at the early stage, which are seldom considered inexisting methods. In this paper, we propose a new approach byusing statistical signal detection method and wavelet transform tohandle the fault signals. This work aims at monitoring vibrationsignals and diagnosing fault types. Our simulation results showthe proposed approach outperforms existing methods, especiallyat an early stage. Our future work will aim at improving themethodâ€™s sensitivity in distinguishing faults similar to each other
