/i>—Signal recovery methods are capable of extracting information from collided signals. In this paper;  we introduce and analyze a signal recovery method based on the voltage histogram of the received signal. Both the original signals and the number of collided signals are recovered. The information of tags is used by our novel algorithm to increase the system throughput in DFSA-based anti-collision algorithms. The recovered signals allow our algorithm to directly obtain the tag identifier. By determining the number of collided signals;  our algorithm is able to calculate an accurate estimate of the total number of tags in the reader’s field. With signal recovery and an accurate tag count;  our algorithm is able to reduce the total number of slots needed to identify all tags;  thereby increasing the throughput. We present a novel frame length optimization method that increases throughout by shrinking the number of slots;  thereby intentionally causing collisions and reducing the total number of empty slots. In addition;  we present a hardware implementation of our novel method that is suitable for integration into RFID readers. When the signal strengths of the tags in collision in the in-phase or quadrature path are not close to each other;  the performance of our method is much better than that of the traditional method in which the collision signal is treated as ineffective and ignored.</p>.
