Accurate performance diagnostics and effective improvement methods are critical to manufacturing operation and management. Most existing efforts are devoted to analyzing the performance of a whole production line rather than considering the complexity of each station/work cell in the line. This paper zooms into a composite work cell with a material handling gantry and focuses on the performance diagnostics of the lay-up station in a composite work center. The methods presented in this paper can be extended and applied to other manufacturing work cells comprising the similar gantry structure. We build a mathematical model to analyze the characteristics of the gantry system such as gantry cycle and waiting time. The evaluation of system production loss, which directly adopts sensor data from the factory floors, provides a quantitative tool for production engineers to monitor and control the system in real-time operation. In addition, the performance diagnostic methods based on production loss attribution and bottleneck identification are developed to guide the decision makers to improve the production system under different resource conditions. The methods are developed based on a work cell with only one gantry under a fixed gantry moving sequence. In the future research, we will extend the study to the systems with more gantries and more complex gantry moving policies.
