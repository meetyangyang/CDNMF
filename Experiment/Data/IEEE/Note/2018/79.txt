- This paper proposes a fast;  robust classification method for online sensor data classification. The proposed method is designed to cope with high levels of sensor outliers. The robustness of the method and its computational efficiency make it particularly appealing for online sensor data classification in challenging field conditions in which the presence of sensor outliers causes practical difficulties for most existing classification algorithms.
