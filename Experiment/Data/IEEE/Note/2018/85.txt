This paper was motivated by the problem of constantly climbing parking needs in major cities. Thispaper suggests a new approach for intelligent parking space sharing, allocation, and pricing from the integrated market design andauction perspective based on Internet of Things/cloud technological architecture. The proposed mechanisms are effective in termsof strategy-proofness and efficiency, leading to remarkable systemprofitability. Reasonable agents’ cost saving, bidders’ value, andex post budget balance for the platform can also be guaranteedin a big city with larger population. Several key managerialimplications have been gained. First, a public platform shouldchoose the integrated mechanism that realizes higher agents' cost saving. Second, agents should be encouraged to rent their privateparking slots to the platform for reaching more agents' welfare.Third, the platform should leverage his owned public parkingspaces to achieve higher system profitability and agents’ costsaving. Fourth, compared with Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction,the simpler first-price auction may lead to higher cost saving foragents in some cases even if it cannot realize allocative efficiencyand incentive compatibility. Finally, the platform’s profit willincrease and the agents’ cost saving will decrease with the percentage of no show. Preliminary simulation experiments suggestthat this approach is feasible but it has not yet been incorporatedinto a prototype system nor verified in real-world applications.Regarding future work, some other factors such as transactioncosts, parking uncertainty, and release of traffic congestion canbe included in the proposed mechanism. Our integrated pricecompatible top trading cycles and chains [e] and one-sidedVickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanisms can exploit the allocationand pricing problems in B2B e-commerce logistics, on-demandtraffic fleet management, and ridesharing optimization.
