This paper presents a numerical routinefor homotopy path planning that can be implemented easily usingdifferent programming languages or programs like C, C++, andMaple CAS software, among many others. The aim of this paperis to introduce a numerical algorithm suitable to be implementedin different platforms even with low hardware resources. Themain advantage of this method is that it is not probabilistic andit is easy to implement by any engineer with basic knowledgeof numerical methods. The numerical simulations show that it ispossible to resolve in milliseconds environment maps composedby several hundreds of obstacles.
