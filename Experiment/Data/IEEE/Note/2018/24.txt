For indoor robot localization, an effective filtering algorithm can improve the accuracy significantly.Existing and commonly used filtering approaches suffer fromweak robustness to the imprecise a priori knowledge of noisevariances used, unsatisfied performance when dealing with sudden behaviors of robot, and large online computational load.This paper suggests a new practical method to estimate thecurrent state using finite past measurements with a finite impulseresponse filter gain computed off-line. By testing it withinthe coupled ultrawideband/inertial navigation sensor localizationframework under different operating conditions, we demonstratethat the proposed method can effectively overcome the aboveproblems, providing fast, accurate, and reliable estimation in apractical environment.
