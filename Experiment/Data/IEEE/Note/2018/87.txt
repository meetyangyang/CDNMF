Scheduling of multicluster tools has recently attracted attention in the growing semiconductor manufacturing industry. Most conventional studies on multicluster tools focus on cyclic scheduling to minimize cycle time with swap strategy. The challenge addressed by this paper is to derive a deadlock-free schedule for multicluster tools with noncyclic operations. We propose a simple deadlock prevention policy that can be applied to large-scale timed Petri net (PN) model of general multicluster tools without enumeration of siphon computations or solution of mixed integer programming. A timed PN model is developed for noncyclic operations of dual-armed multicluster tools with a dual ath. The computational results show that the approximately 10% of the total throughput of the proposed method is better than those of the conventional methods. It enables more efficient operations for noncyclic scheduling under transient periods including cleaning operations.
