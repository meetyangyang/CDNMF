The method described in this paper canbe used to discover subgroups of agents and their behaviorpatterns based on spatialâ€“temporal data of all agents in thegroup. The subgroups are formed by agents that behave similarlyor complementarily for a certain task. The behavior patternsof the subgroups are expressed in the form of signal temporallogic statements. These are logical statements about the numberof agents in the subgroups that are in certain states duringa certain time interval. For example, if there are more thantwo blue agents in the region, then within 2 h, there will bemore than three red agents in the same region. The behaviorpatterns inferred using this method can be used in: 1) analysisof group behavior while performing a task, e.g., in sports tacticalanalysis and 2) prediction of future group behavior under similarsituations.
