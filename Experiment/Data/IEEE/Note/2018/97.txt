Additive manufacturing (AM) processes have attracted much attention and showed many advantages over the traditional subtractive manufacturing processes. However, the product quality issues make AM intractable for high-quality parts in industrial applications. This paper aims to address the quality issues by modeling both quantitative quality variables, such as dimensional accuracy, and qualitative quality variables, such as the binary (go/no-go) indicator for surface conditions. Both offline process setting variables and in situ process variables are used in the model as predictors. Such a model is important for systematically quality evaluation of AM parts, and provides the basis for future process monitoring and control. The merits of the proposed method are demonstrated with simulation studies and a case study in a fused deposition modeling process.
