The internal tool-temperature fieldaround the tool/chip interface during cutting offers essentialinformation to monitor tool-wear and ensure surface-qualityparticularly in finishing cuts, which is difficult to be monitoredbecause of the stringent real-time requirements (including lowcost and high accuracy) in harsh working environments. Thispaper presents a potentially low-cost solution that combinesnoncontact surface temperature measurements with high-fidelity physics-based computational models for monitoring the internalpeak temperature at the tool/chip frictional contact during cutting. This physics-based method requires only a small number ofpreselected features, and uses thermal isotherms and streamlinesto detect and substitute any occlusions in the IR images. Themethod does not rely on high-resolution (HR) images to inferthe steep temperature gradient near the tool-tip where the peaktemperature occurs, and thus can be implemented with a relatively low-cost IR imager. Unlike traditional least-square methodsthat bases solutions to a heat-conduction partial differentialequation (PDE), the ANN is trained with precomputed physicsbased models based on a novel dual-field (far-field and near-field)approach. The ANN-based method not only eliminates the needto solve the time-demanding PDE in real time, but also effectivelyaccounts for parameter variations due to the uncertain frictionalheat-fluxes at the contact interface during cutting.
