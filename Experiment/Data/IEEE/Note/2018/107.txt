Motivated by the need to keep humans safe when working alongside robots, our earlier work proposes a method of trajectory planning where the robot certifies each movement as safe before it performs it. For this to prove that unsafe collisions cannot occur, an overapproximative prediction of the human is needed, meaning that no possible future position of the human is outside the predicted region, or reachable occupancy. However, making this prediction both small enough (so that it does not include unreachable regions) and fast enough for real-time use is not straightforward. We find the limits of human motion by asking a range of test subjects to perform movements as fast as possible. We calculate the reachable occupancies based on these limits and show that our predictions are indeed overapproximative, fast, and not wasteful of volume. One can then use the aforementioned approach to guarantee safety; future challenges are reliably sensing the humanâ€™s pose and implementing our approach on an industrial robot.
