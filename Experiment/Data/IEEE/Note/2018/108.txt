Identification is an approach to obtain the models of an existing closed-loop discrete-event system from an observed I/O sequence, discovering both sequential and concurrent processes within the same system. The result is an understandable and compact model that approximates the observed behavior and can be used for reverse engineering. To get better insight on the behavior of the system, splitting it into subsystems and studying distributed models might be easier. Besides, identifying smaller subsystems reduces the computational cost. The main contribution of this paper is therefore a partitioning approach for distributed DES identification. Only the knowledge of the I/Os and the observed I/O sequence are required to provide a partitioning adapted to reverse engineering and compact distributed models, in reasonable computation times.
