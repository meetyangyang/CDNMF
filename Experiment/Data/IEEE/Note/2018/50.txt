This paper presents an opposite problemof immobilization or caging. Given two interlocking parts, onlyone of which may be cut into pieces. How can we unimmobilize or uncage one from another? We explore this problem in twoaspects: the lower bound and the upper bound on the numberof pieces that the divisible part must be cut into. This paper isan early theoretical exploration of this problem. We verified ourmethods in a virtual 2-D environment instead of building physicalstructures. Extension of this paper to 3-D could have manyapplications, including robot self-assembly, 3-D fabrication modeldesign, search-and-rescue, packaging, and robotic surgery.
