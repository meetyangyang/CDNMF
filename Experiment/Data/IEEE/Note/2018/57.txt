The series-machine system is pervasivein industry and it usually operates under type-II failure mechanisms (i.e., the breakdown of a machine does not make any otherseries machines forced down). Nevertheless, the existing researchon type-II failure mechanisms is very limited. Thus, the efficiency and other performance measures of such systems are,in general, approximately evaluated based on type-I mechanisms (i.e., the breakdown of a machine could make all other seriesmachines forced down). However, the error of this approximationmay be large and unacceptable. In this paper, a unified approachis proposed to analyze the efficiency of the series-machine system.Due to the difficulties in deriving closed-form expressions undertype-II failure mechanisms, algorithms are developed to calculatethe efficiency of the series-machine system. Theoretical resultsensure the effectiveness of the algorithms
