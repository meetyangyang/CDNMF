This paper concerns high-level intelligent automation of unmanned vehicle operations in the context ofundersea inspection and maintenance. The objective is to providea robust long-term autonomy, enabling the vehicle to make itsown decisions about how to prioritize goals and use its resources.Plans to achieve large numbers of goals over time are constructedautonomously by a planning system using models of activity andresource consumption. In order to avoid running up againstresource bounds in a way that would compromise robustness,models of resource consumption are conservative. An importantaspect of long-term autonomy concerns how unused resourcesthat accumulate over time because of conservative assumptionscan be used to increase overall utility. The approach we describeis deterministic: we do not model uncertainty or allow the plannerto reason with contingencies. Instead, we focus on how to exploitresource intelligently to obtain the best available utility, in away that does not undermine the reliability or predictability ofoperational behavior.
