The traditional Mura visual inspectionmethod can address only medium-sized Mura defects, such asregion Mura, cluster Mura, and vertical-band Mura, and is notsuitable for small Mura defects, for example, spot Mura. Theproposed accurate Mura defect visual inspection (AMVI) methodcan accurately and simultaneously inspect not only mediumsized Mura defects but also small and large Mura defects. Theproposed outlier-prejudging-based image background construction (OPBC) algorithm of the AMVI method is employed toimprove the Mura true detection rate, while the proposed regiongradient-based level set (RGLS) algorithm is used to reducethe Mura false detection rate. Moreover, this method can beapplied to online vision inspection: OPBC can be implementedin parallel processing units, while RGLS is applied only to thecandidate regions of the inspected image. In addition, AMVI canbe extended to other low-contrast defect vision inspection tasks,such as the inspection of glass, steel strips, and ceramic tiles.
