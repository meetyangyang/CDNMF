Designing the operational control architecture of a critical process, such as a power plant, is anextremely time-consuming task that requires, in particular, to finda suitable and minimum-cost set of industrial controllers to whichthe numerous control functions can be assigned and thereafterimplemented. This design task is currently performed by expertswho imagine, evaluate, and compare different solutions. Hence,several iterations of the assignment process are necessary duringthis task. The practical aim of this paper is to automate thisprocess to facilitate and speed up architecture design. This paperhas been made in the frame of a cooperative research projectwith a company, which designs and implements control systems ofpower plants. Nevertheless, the generic results that are presentedin this paper can be used for other critical processes (oil, chemicalprocesses, and water management) where a large number ofcontrol functions with different impacts on safety are to beassigned to controllers, because the proposed heuristic scales well.
