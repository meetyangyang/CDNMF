This paper is motivated by the problem of observing the state of traffic in a highway setting from Lagrangian sensors. These are sensors that travel with individual vehicles rather than the traditional sensors that remain at fixed positions. There is much literature written on traditional sensors, but currently, there is development on what additional value Lagrangian sensors can provide. Lagrangian sensors recently became plausible, and readily available with the growth of smartphones. The problem that is studied is how much of the traffic behavior can be inferred from different numbers of the Lagrangian sensors. A traditional mathematical model for traffic flow is studied in the Lagrangian coordinates. The concept of observability and condition number is used to analyze how much and how well the sensors can capture traffic information. This problem is studied with idealized vehicle behavior, but this paper will be extended to cope with more realistic driving behaviors in the future.
