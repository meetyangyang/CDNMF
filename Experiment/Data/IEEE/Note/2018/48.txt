A commonly used industrial gripper isthe parallel gripper. While it is well suited for grasping objectsthat have parallel edges, it is less suited for objects with morecomplicated geometries, and it relies on high coefficients offriction. This paper considers the robust grasping of polygonalobjects using equilateral three-finger robot hands. Such handsare mechanically simple, and enable grasping objects withcomplicated shapes without relying on contact friction. To safelygrasp an object, the hand is first brought to a caging configurationaround the object. Once the object is caged, it cannot beaccidentally ejected from the hand, and the fingers can be closedsafely until an immobilizing grasp is reached. To reach a specificimmobilizing grasp, the fingers are placed in the three cagingregions associated with that grasp. This paper proposes a methodthat is both physically intuitive and computationally simple,to compute these caging regions. Although this paper considers grasping polygonal objects using frictionless point fingers,the proposed method can be used for grasping nonpolygonalobjects using identical disc fingers, by expanding the object bythe finger radius, and then approximating the expanded object bya polygon. Fingerâ€™s center can then be treated as a point finger.Frictional jamming of the fingers can overcome using rotatingfingers or slightly vibrating the hand.
