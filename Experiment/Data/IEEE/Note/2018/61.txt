The problem of tracking a surgicalsuture thread was addressed in this paper. Since the suturethread is highly deformable, any tracking algorithm must berobust to intersections, occlusions, knot tying, and length changes.The detection algorithm introduced in this paper is capable ofdistinguishing different threads when they intersect. The trackingalgorithm presented here demonstrates that it is possible, usingpolynomial curves, to track a suture thread as it deforms,becomes occluded, changes length, and even ties a knot in real time. The detection algorithm can enhance directional thinfeatures, while the polynomial curve modeling can track anystring-like structure. Further integration of the polynomial curvewith a feed-forward thread model could improve the stability androbustness of the thread tracking.
