Perception, motion planning, grasping,and robotic system engineering have reached a level of maturitythat makes it possible to explore automating simple warehousetasks in semistructured environments that involve high-mix, low volume picking applications. This survey summarizes lessonslearned from the first Amazon Picking Challenge, highlightingmechanism design, perception, and motion planning algorithms,as well as software engineering practices that were most successful in solving a simplified order fulfillment task. While the choiceof mechanism mostly affects execution speed, the competitiondemonstrated the systems challenges of robotics and illustratedthe importance of combining reactive control with deliberativeplanning.
