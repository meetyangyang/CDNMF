Determining whether a robot manipulator can cover a range of movement in a Cartesian workspaceunder joint limits and collision constraints is typically addressedby an engineerâ€™s intuition and trial and error. This paper presentsan algorithm to solve this problem systematically. The methodoptimizes a mapping from workspace to joint space to minimizethe number of discontinuities. The resulting maps can be used toselect continuous inverse kinematic solutions to follow workspacepaths, and their visualizations can aid in workcell design, robotselection, and robot placement.
