This paper is motivated by the problemof how to choose appropriate parameters for models used indeformable object manipulation. Existing approaches use timeconsuming data collection and analysis methods to generatemodels for a given object and/or task. In contrast, our approachcan be applied to multiple deformable objects or tasks withoutthis time-consuming model generation step, learning what modelsare useful during the execution of the task itself. This enablesthe faster development of systems for a wide range of tasks,including those where a priori data collection is not possible.In this paper, we are only considering the modeling and controlaspects of deformable object manipulation. These ideas can thenbe integrated with sensing and planning systems for commercial/industrial applications. We briefly discuss some methods andconsiderations for such an integration at the end of this paper
