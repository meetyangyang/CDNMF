Model discovery is useful to performreverse engineering of ill-known systems. The algorithms proposed in this paper build 1-bounded PN models, which areenough powerful to describe many discrete-event processes fromindustry. The efficiency of the method allows processing verylarge sequences. Thus, an automated modeling tool can bedeveloped for dealing with data issued from real systems.
