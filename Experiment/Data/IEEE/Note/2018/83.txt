This paper provides an open source;  extensible;  3-D database for dissemination to the robotics and graphics communities. Model-driven methods are proliferating;  and they need to be applied;  tested;  and validated in real environments. A key idea we have exploited is to have an innovative and novel use of simulation. This database will serve as infrastructure for developing advanced robotic machine learning algorithms. We want to address this machine learning idea ourselves;  but we expect the dissemination of the database to other researchers with different agendas and task applications;  which will bring wide progress in this area. Our proposed methods;  as mentioned earlier;  can be easily applied to interrelated areas. One example is that the 3-D shape-based matching algorithm can be used for other objects;  such as bottles;  papers;  and food. After integrating with other robotic systems;  the use of the robot can be easily extended to other tasks;  such as making food;  cleaning room;  and fetching objects;  to assist our daily life.
