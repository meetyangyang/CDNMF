Time-of-use (TOU) pricing is widely implemented in many countries around the world, which provides variable electricity price over time. An appropriate response to the TOU policy can significantly reduce energy expense. This paper proposes an improved mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach for the parallel machine scheduling problem under TOU tariffs to minimize the total electricity cost based on a recently published model. The proposed approach can be easily implemented by using a commercial MILP solver such as IBM ILOG CPLEX. The optimal schedule could help decision makers reduce energy cost while maintaining high production efficiency.
