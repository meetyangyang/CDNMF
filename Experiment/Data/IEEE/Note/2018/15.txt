This paper presents a viable approachto autonomous aerial transportation using multiple aerial manipulators equipped with a multidegree-of-freedom robotic arm.Existing approaches for cooperative manipulation based on forcedecomposition or impedance-based control often require a heavyor expensive force/torque sensor. However, this paper suggests amethod without using a heavy or expensive force/torque sensorbased on closed-chain dynamics in joint space and rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT) that generates the desired trajectoryof aerial manipulators. Unlike conventional RRT, in this paper,our method can also avoid an unknown moving obstacle duringaerial transportation by exploiting RRT and dynamic movement primitives. The proposed planning and control synthesisis tested to demonstrate performance in a lab environmentwith two custom-made aerial manipulators and a commonobject.
