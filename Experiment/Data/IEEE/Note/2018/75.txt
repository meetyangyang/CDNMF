This paper reports a practical solutionfor station allocation for public bicycle sharing systems (PBSSs).PBSSs have increased tremendously in recent years and becomepopular in many countries. They complement the bus and subwaysystems and contribute to better environment and lifestyle. On theother hand, they cause some serious issues with their planningand operations. The station allocation for PBSSs is one ofits fundamental challenges as it greatly affects investment and running costs as well as customer satisfaction. Note that thestation allocation for PBSSs should be addressed based on aunified dynamic model taking into consideration the transitionof passengers, PBSS, and urban public transportation systemtogether. Thus, a dynamically synthesized, physically realizable,and satisfactory solution for station allocation of PBSSs issignificant for the success of practitioners. This paper proposes aframework to analytically obtain the station allocation of bicyclesharing systems based on a new accessibility criterion associatedwith detailed planning requirements and on a hybrid min-plusmodel corresponding to an integrated public transportationsystem. Furthermore, an algorithm for obtaining the minimumnumber of bicycle stations is presented for ease of actualimplementation in applications and demonstrated with numericalsimulation on the systems in two cities, Ningbo and Hangzhou.It should be pointed out that our optimization formulation isindicative, and alternative formulations with other objective functions and constraints are possible. But, the proposed accessibilityas the most fundamental constraint of transportation systemsshould be included in any formulation.
