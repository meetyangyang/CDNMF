Lung cancer is the primary cause ofcancer deaths in the U.S. It has a very low five-year survival rate,and only a small percentage of lung cancer cases are diagnosedat an early stage. Particularly, the diagnosis-to-treatment processis a long, complex procedure in which patients experiencesubstantial delays. Thus, reducing diagnosis-to-treatment timeis critical, as prolonged waiting times may lead to advancedcancer stage and/or decreased survival rates. In this paper,to analyze the diagnosis-to-treatment process for lung cancer patients who receive surgical resections, a novel analytical methodis introduced. First, five critical steps in diagnosis-to-surgeryprocess are considered: 1) chest X-ray and/or CT scan; 2) diagnostic biopsy; 3) noninvasive staging; 4) invasive staging; and5) surgery. Then, we decompose the complex care delivery processinto multiple serial processes, where each process represents aunique sequence of diagnosis steps that patients may go through.To evaluate the system performance, formulas to calculate themean and variability of waiting time during the diagnosis-tosurgery process are derived. An approximation algorithm isdeveloped to evaluate the probability to finish the diagnosis-tosurgery process within a desired or given time interval, referredto as waiting-time performance. In addition, to identify thebottleneck waiting time whose improvement will lead to thelargest reduction in overall waiting time, we present simpleindicators based on the data collected on the clinic/hospital floor.Finally, we introduce a case study at Baptist Memorial Hospital.It is shown that the steps between chest X-ray and/or CT scanand diagnostic biopsy and the steps between noninvasive stagingand surgery are the most critical ones. Such a method provides aquantitative tool for the analysis and improvement of lung cancerdiagnosis-to-surgery process.
