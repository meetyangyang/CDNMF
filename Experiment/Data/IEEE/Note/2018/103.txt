 Task scheduling is one of the challenging problems in cloud computing;  especially when deadline and cost are considered. As an important actuator;  virtual machines (VMs) play a vital role for cloud task scheduling. To meet task deadlines;  one needs to save the time of creating VMs;  task waiting time;  and executing time. To minimize the task execution cost;  one needs to schedule tasks onto their most suitable VMs for execution. We propose a cloud task scheduling framework based on a two-stage strategy to do so. It precreates VMs according to historical scheduling data;  therefore saving time for tasks to wait for creating VMs. It matches tasks with their most suitable VMs dynamically;  therefore saving their execution cost. Under the premise of meeting task deadlines;  it minimizes the waiting time of VMs to schedule tasks;  thus minimizing the cost to be paid by users who utilize VMs. The readily deployable algorithms are designed and illustrated to improve cloud task scheduling and execution results in comparison with those using traditional methods.
