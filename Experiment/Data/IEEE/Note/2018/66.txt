This paper investigates the profit maximization problem for a green data center (GDC) while meetingdelay constraints for all admitted tasks. Previous task scheduling algorithms do not jointly investigate temporal variation inrevenue, green energy, and price of grid. Thus, they fail to meetthe delay constraints of all admitted tasks. In this paper, a newapproach that overcomes drawbacks of existing algorithms isproposed. It is obtained by using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that solves a constrained nonlinear optimization problem.Simulation results show that compared with several existingalgorithms, it increases both throughput and profit. It can be readily incorporated into real-life industrial GDCs. The futurework needs to investigate the repair/failure effect of GDCs onthe proposed time-aware task scheduling.
