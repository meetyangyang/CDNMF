For automation applications in manufacturing where object models are precisely known, “energybounded cages” are a robust approach to robot grasping inthe presence of gravity or friction. This paper presents asynthesis algorithm for planar instances, where the object canbe modeled as a planar extrusion and the motion occurs in thevertical or horizontal plane. We also present experiments withrobots and a website with code and data.
