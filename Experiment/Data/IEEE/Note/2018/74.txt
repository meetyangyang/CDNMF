This paper is inspired by the problem of shared subway shuttle bus dynamic route planning for the “last mile” scene;  and it is also applicable to other scenes;  including commuting scenes;  urban transportation hub scenes;  and destination scenes of the tourist market. Shared bus operation routes at such scenes are usually aimed at trips with fixed destinations. Existing approaches to planning routes are generally designed for traditional transportation;  such as traditional buses and taxis. In this paper;  we propose a novel two-stage dynamic route planning approach (SubBus) based on the operation characteristics of shared subway shuttle buses. We perform a resident travel behavior analysis to improve the accuracy of travel requirement prediction. After that;  we combine the prediction results and station properties to gain shared bus optimal routes. We then display how to apply SubBus to optimize shared bus operation status based on crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data generated by Panda Bus Company. We keep a continuous collaboration with the company to optimize the approach details and experimental effects;  which demonstrate that our approach can generate effective routes for shared subway shuttle buses to optimize operation status on the “last mile” issue.
