Automated stowage planning has become a trend as the number of mega-scale containerships being deployed has increased drastically over the past decade. Due to the nature of the problem, it is impractical to expect the best stowage plan within a limited amount of time, and hence, many heuristics have been devised to reduce the solution space. Many heuristics algorithms share a common coreâ€“repeatedly selecting a stowage slot and a container (selection mechanism) and evaluate whether all of the constraints are satisfied. To improve the efficiency, most studies aim to reduce the number of locationcontainer pairs being considered. We consider an alternative approach that improves the efficiency of the constraint evaluation engine. Specifically, we show how to improve the efficiency by strategically reordering the sequence in which the constraints are evaluated. With the improvements on the efficiency, the stowage algorithm is one step closer to being able to generate solutions in real time. This may enable the shipping companies to take lastminute shipment order and react to changes in demands quickly.
