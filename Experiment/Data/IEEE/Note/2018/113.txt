More and more robotic applications involve contact with at least partially unknown environments. As a consequence, they require control approaches that go beyond the traditional position control. In particular, information about contact forces and torques has to be taken into account. However, integrating additional sensing equipment to obtain the required force/torque information is often technically challenging and expensive. Cartesian contact force and torque estimation allows obtaining force/torque information solely from available sensors. The estimation technique can be regarded as a virtual sensor, and hence this brief deals with a key technology enabling force controlled robotic applications such as assembly, grinding, and deburring without the need for expensive additional sensing.
