The work presented here was motivatedby an industrial problem of micromilling. In micromilling,chatter, known as self-excited vibrations, is one of the criticalissues as it gives rise to a lot of production problems, deterioratingthe machined surface finish, decreasing the machining efficiency,and has an adverse effect on tool wear and tool life. Therehas been tremendous work done on the investigation of chattermechanism and chatter suppression. Appropriate upfront designsof the machine tool, fixturing, spindle, choosing appropriate toolgeometric angle, and spindle speed control are the means forsuppressing chatter occurrence. Recently, with the advent ofpiezoelectric devices, more and more attention is attracted to theapplication of piezoelectric actuators (PZTAs) for micromillingsystems. PZTAs have the prominent characteristic of fast expansions with small response time. With an electrical voltage applied,the PZTA can expand and reach its nominal displacement onthe order of microseconds and a pushing or pulling force can beexcited with large accelerations, so that the position of the milling tool can be maneuvered to suppress the chatter effect. In thispaper, we attempt to control the unstable regenerative chatter inmicromilling by employing two PZTAs as active control elementswith the developed adaptive controller, where the uncertaintiesof the dynamics of cutting are approximated by neural networks.The time-delayed effect of chatter is addressed by the Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii functional. The stability proof of the closed-loopsystem, the convergence analysis, and the simulations indicatethe developed control approach is sensible. In the future work,we shall focus on the hysteresis effect of the PZTAs and theimplementation of the developed theoretical work to a practicalsystem.
