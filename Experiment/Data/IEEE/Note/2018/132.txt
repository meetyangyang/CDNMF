Stability is a vital factor for the safety of the ship and the goods inside. At a terminal, when a berthed container ship receives loading and unloading operations performed by quay cranes (QCs), it is required that the ship stability criterion does not exceed a certain threshold. In practice, ship operation managers are keen in minimizing the shipâ€™s turnaround time via an efficient QC schedule for loading and unloading containers without leaning the ship to one side. The schedule is then implemented by automatic scheduling systems or simulation tools in the terminal routines. This paper presents some practical stability constraints and integrates them into the traditional QC scheduling model. The results show that by considering the stability constraints, the ship will become more stable, but the turnaround time will not be affected significantly. We believe that the introduction of ship stability constraints can not only fill in the gap between the research on QC scheduling and the real-world ship handling practices but also enrich the studies on logistics planning and port operations.
