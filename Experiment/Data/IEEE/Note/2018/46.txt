Providing capability for rapid responsiveness, enhancement of product quality, and production atlow cost are the three main objectives for the wide manufacturing firms. Fixtures are widely used across manufacturingand assembly processes, and they are closely linked to allthese three objectives. Todayâ€™s manufacturing enterprises faceunprecedented challenges to control costs and to deal with anever increasing number of product variants and smaller lot sizes.All these facts raise high demands on computer-aided intelligentfixture design. Case-based reasoning (CBR) method, tacklingnew problem by using the solution of similar past problems orthrough revising the previous solution, gains popularity amongresearchers and practitioners. However, existing CBR methodsput more focus on CBR framework design while the caseretrieving, the key process of any CBR methods, still relies onsome basic feature attributes comparison. This would inevitablyreduce the overall effectiveness of the CBR method. In view of that, this paper proposed a graph method for case retrievalbased on comparing maximal common subgraphs (MCSs).Dictated by fixture functional requirement, a constraint (to matchmachining features and/or other user defined requirement) hasbeen imposed during the MCS search process. This constraintturns out to be quite useful in term of reducing search space andincreasing computation efficiency. Robust algorithms have beensubsequently developed to implement this technique. Graph is apowerful tool to analyze structured object, the proposed methodcan handle some bespoke and complex fixture design cases. Thepresented method is intuitive and flexible and can be integratedinto existing CBR frameworks to improve the allover effectivenessof current intelligent fixture design.
