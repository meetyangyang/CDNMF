Current industrial robotic inspectionapproaches largely consist of a manual control of robotic platformmotion to desired points, with the aim of producing a number ofstraight scans for larger areas, often spaced meters apart. Thestructures featuring large surface area and multiple obstaclesare routinely inspected with such manual approaches, whichare both labor intensive and error prone, and do not guaranteeacquisition of full area coverage. The presented system addressesthese limitations through a combined hardware and softwareapproach. Core to the operation of the system is a fully wireless,differential drive crawler with integrated active ultrasonic wheelprobe, to provide remote thickness mapping. Automation of thepath generation algorithms is produced using the commercialCAD/CAM software algorithms, and this paper sets out anadaptable methodology for producing a custom postprocessorto convert the exported G-codes to suitable kinematic commandsfor mobile robotic platforms. The differential drive crawler is used in this paper to demonstrate the process. This approachhas benefits in terms of improved industrial standardization andoperational repeatability. The inspection capabilities of the systemwere documented on an indoor mock-inspection scenario, withina motion tracking cell to provide quantitative performance figuresfor the approach. Future work is required to integrate the onboard positioning strategies, removing the dependence on globalsystems, for full automated deployment capability.
