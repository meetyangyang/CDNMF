Tolerance is a matter of everyday life to manufacturing and assembly engineers and designers. It directly impacts the product quality and production costs. Driven by the clientâ€™s ever-increasing variety needs, more and more deformable parts with complex surfaces have been entering into production in the past decade. However, existing degree of freedom (DOF) concept-based models, surrounding the idea of six DOFs of a rigid body, have difficulty in handling. While the decomposed type of models may help provide useful insight into the geometric variation, they are dependent on reliable measurement data, which may not be readily available. Motivated by the idea of deforming a manufacturing part indirectly through reshaping its surrounding (purposely designed) parametric space envelope (PSE), this paper proposes a novel spatial model for tolerancing. The proposed model is intuitive and is able to provide insight into geometric variations by visualizing them. Due to its novel model design, the proposed method can handle some fairly complex parts and surfaces (be it parametric or implicit) and is able to take into account form errors. The base curve to construct the PSE can be a Bezier curve, which is commonly available in computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing systems and is familiar to many practitioners (designers and engineers). This could substantially lower the application hurdle and open up a potentially wide application for the proposed method.
