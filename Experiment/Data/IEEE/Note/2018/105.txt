Motivated by the popular auction-based dynamic pricing in the modern Internet business, this paper proposes a Vickrey–Clarke–Groves auction-based approach for multigranularity service composition in order to overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches, e.g., unpredictability in service pricing, and lack of economic efficiency. The proposed approach instantiates a composite service in an economically efficient way and it offers service providers with the incentives to honestly declare the true costs of their concrete services in the bids. In the experiments, compared with fine-grained service composition, the proposed approach reduces the social cost and user payment of service composition by 6.8% and 11.2% on average, respectively, and it also shows superiority over the firstprice auction-based approach.
