In order to support precision farming technology and agricultural automation, it is very essential to estimate the nutrient content in plants to prevent over fertilizing that will harm environment. Furthermore, the existing method to determine nutrient content in leaves is destructive as well as time consuming and requires special expertise to operate expensive devices. A number of methods have been developed to estimate nutrient content in leaves nondestructively based on the color features of the leaves. Most of these methods, however, are conducted in a controlled environment with artificial lighting. Such methods are not practical and need various equipment. We propose a low-cost, simple, and accurate technique to estimate nitrogen content in wheat leaves by analyzing RGB color of the leaves images. In this paper, we found that the developed DSELMs fusion has enabled better performance in normalizing images and is faster than other neural network types, i.e., backpropagation-based multilayer perceptron and original extreme learning machine. In image segmentation step, the established DSELM shows good performance to recognize and distinguish wheat leaves from other undesired background images. Furthermore, the developed weighted DSELMs have demonstrated enhanced ability in estimating nutrient content.
