Service recommendation accuracy formashup creation is often limited due to poor quality of servicedescriptions. Mashup descriptions contain valuable informationabout functions and features of its component services, whichcan be leveraged to enhance descriptive quality of originalservice profiles. Based on the assumption, this paper proposes anovel two-phase service recommendation framework to facilitatemashup creation. Specifically, our approach reconstructs serviceprofiles by extracting appropriate words from historical mashupdescriptions. Then, a novel service recommendation algorithmis developed by exploiting popularity and relevance measureshidden in the reconstructed profiles. Moreover, we propose therules of dominant words discovery and employ it to further refineour algorithm.
