Traditionally, chiller plant operation is often based on rules. For example, the number of active chillers is the minimum number that satisfies cooling requirements, and chilled water supply temperature is constant. Chiller power consumption is a nonlinear function of chiller cooling load and chilled/condenser water supply temperatures. Energy is wasted since chiller efficiency is low with fixed supply temperatures, and sometimes energy consumption of two chillers is less than that of one chiller. To save energy, chiller plant optimization with good decision variables such as the number of active units and chilled/condenser water supply temperatures is studied. The problem is challenging with high nonlinearity caused by considering such temperatures as decision variables. Furthermore, with discrete variables (e.g., the number of active chillers), the problem is combinatorial. To efficiently solve the problem for high-quality solutions, a novel decomposition and coordination approach is developed. Complexity and nonlinearity of a subproblem are reduced drastically after decomposition as compared with the original problem so that appropriate nonlinear methods are used to solve the subproblems. The results show that the solutions are near-optimal with short computational time and the approach is scalable. Additionally, major energy savings are achieved as compared with benchmark strategies. The approach provides a new and powerful way to solve chiller plant optimization problems and beyond.
