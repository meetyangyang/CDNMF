Control software development can beconsidered one of the challenges in automation field for achievingleadership in the future economic market. This work presentsa model-driven engineering-based approach making use ofboth automation and software engineering methods and techniques for developing automation control systems. The framework implements the methodology for industrial automationsystems (MeiAâ€¢) for guiding developers through the development phases and generates the analysis and design documentation using domain terminology, the design documentationthat involves the minimal units of design, and the programorganization units in one-to-one correspondence with the minimalunits of design. From a practical point of view, it should behighly emphasized that developers of automation projects benefitfrom more structured designs, reduced number of errors, andimproved project documentation.
