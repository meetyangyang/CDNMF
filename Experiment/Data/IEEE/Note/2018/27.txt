Building indoor occupancy is essentialto facilitate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)control, lighting adjustment, and geofencing to achieve occupancycomfort and energy efficiency. The significance of this paperis the proposal of a paradigm of sensing that results in aparsimonious and accurate occupancy inference model, whichholds considerable potential for energy saving and improvementof HVAC operations. Parameters of the model are data-driven,which exhibit long-term stability and robustness across all theoccupantsâ€™ experiments. The proposed framework can also beapplied to other tasks, such as indoor pollutants sourceidentification, while requiring minimal infrastructure expenses.The data set and algorithm code are available to assist thecomparison study.
