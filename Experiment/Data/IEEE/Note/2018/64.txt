A constant-force stage can producea constant output force without using a force control. It isattractive for biological micromanipulation. This paper presentsthe design and testing of a novel constant-force flexure stage. Theconstant force indicates a zero stiffness for the mechanism. Thestage mechanism is devised using modified leaf flexure (MLF)to achieve positive-stiffness structure. Bistable beams are usedto design negative-stiffness structure by making use of theirpostbuckling characteristics. Two bistable beams and two MLFsare combined together to construct a zero-stiffness structure.A conventional stage is also fabricated for comparison study.The performance of the proposed constant-force stage has beenverified by simulation and experimental studies. Results indicatethat the developed stage system has great superiority overconventional one in terms of reducing driving force, increasingmotion range, and reducing force fluctuation. Experimentaldemonstration of bio-micromanipulation has been presented toreveal its potential applications.
