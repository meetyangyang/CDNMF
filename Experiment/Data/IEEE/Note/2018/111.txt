The proposed SUIO-based approach achieves robustness in FD against disturbances, noises, and modeling uncertainties (e.g., linearization errors) either by decoupling or by bounding their effect on the residuals. Moreover, this approach allows FI by generating a set of structured residuals decoupling the effect of faults. The authors think that this method can be used for processes that operate around equilibrium points. In this case, we can linearize the nonlinear systems into linear systems with bounded unknown inputs and then apply the proposed method. Moreover, an important feature of this method is that it can overcome the design condition of the standard UIO approach, which means that it could be applied to a larger number of applications.
