This paper was originally motivatedby the stylus path planning problem in sweep scanning oncurved surfaces (which is a new surface inspection technology),though it is also applicable to shape registration and matching.Traditional coordinate measuring machine inspection of curvedsurfaces depends heavily on manual intervention, resulting ina very slow and tedious process and the acquired data areprone to inconsistency due to the discontinuous nature of theoperation. In contrast, sweep scanning adopts a configuration ofa deflectable stylus mounted on a motorized articulating headwith two rotary axes inside, which enables the stylus tip tofollow a continuous path without having to leave the surface.The head itself is mounted on an xyz table. During a sweepscanning, the head slowly moves on the xyz table (which is heavyand has stringent dynamic constraints due to its large mass)along a nominal path, while the stylus (which is extremely light)quickly oscillates in a direction transverse to the path of the head.The proposed curved reflection axis offers to be a powerful algebraic model for generating a nominal head path for sweepscanning. The reported work is preliminary though, especiallyin terms of covering the entire surface and also considering thespecific length of the stylus, which will be our future work.
