The goal of this paper is to improvethe estimation and optimization of the network-level reliabilityperformance of industrial wireless sensor networks (WSNs) tosatisfy their strict control requirements. In harsh industrialapplication scenarios, many factors affect radio link quality, suchas RF transmit power, communication distance, and randombackground noise. Existing link quality estimation approachesmainly focus on providing a smoothed estimation of radiolink quality without any solution for optimizing communicationreliability to satisfy certain requirements. This paper suggests anew approach in which WSN nodes are used to measure andestimate the parameters of the scenario in which the nodeswill be deployed and then to estimate and optimize the worstcase reliability (which is a lower-bound value rather than asmoothed value) to ensure that the network is qualified. Througha real-world case study, we demonstrate how to estimate thelower bound on reliability and how to optimize the reliability by computing the maximum deployment distance between nodesas an example. The experiments suggest that this approach isfeasible.
