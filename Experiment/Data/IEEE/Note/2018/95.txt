This paper was motivated by the problem of automatically updating digital maps in a manner of mobile crowdsensing. Existing approaches can update stores in maps through a manual survey or update roads automatically from mobile crowdsensing data. Since the store information is a crucial component in digital map, this paper suggests a novel approach to automatically update stores in digital maps through mobile crowdsensing. This is necessary, in general, because the accuracy of digital map will directly affect the quality of various location based services. Therefore, the system proposed in this paper is useful for engineers and developers to obtain precise digital maps for localization, navigation, automatic drive, etc.
