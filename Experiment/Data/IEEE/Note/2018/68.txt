As design of experiment techniques havebeen widely used in practice to automate the systematic datacollection and experimental procedures by perturbing the systemin order to better understand the relationships between thefactors, here, we provide practitioners a counterpart approachfor systematic expert knowledge elicitation. It can be used incombination with a imperfect data set, while the data couldprovide a starting point and further inform the expert knowledgeelicitation by prioritizing the information queries. The data andexpert knowledge gathered will be fused to learn the relationshipsbetween the factors with the estimation of the uncertainties.
