Semiconductor manufacturing systems are among the most advanced and complicated manufacturing systems. Their key equipment is highly automated robot-based cluster tools. With wafer residency time constraints;  wafer revisiting;  activity time variation;  chamber cleaning requirements;  and failure-prone process modules (PMs);  it is very challenging to schedule and control them. This paper surveys their modeling and scheduling methods. Scheduling them requires one to schedule their robot tasks and processing activities simultaneously. Owing to wafer residency time constraints and the lack of buffers among PMs;  it is difficult to conduct their optimal scheduling. This paper presents a thorough review of the state-ofthe-art research results about modeling and optimal scheduling of clusters tools and indicates the future research directions.
