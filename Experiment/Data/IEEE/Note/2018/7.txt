The automated steering and manipulation of multiple nanowires would enable the scalable assemblyof nanodevices for a variety of applications. This paper presentsan electric-field-based design for simultaneous motion planningand control of multiple nanowires in liquid suspension. Thedesign uses a set of electrode arrays to drive and orient multiplenanowires from their starting locations to targeted locationsunder electrophoretic forces. The motion control of multiplenanowires in fluid suspension is first presented to steer thenanowires simultaneously along the given trajectories. Then,we present a two-stage motion planning algorithm to generate the total shortest distance trajectories for all nanowireswhile avoiding collision. We present extensive simulations andexperiments to demonstrate the motion planning and controlof multiple nanowires to form various geometric patterns.The results will help provide a foundation for scalableautomated methods for manipulating nanowires to buildnanodevices.
