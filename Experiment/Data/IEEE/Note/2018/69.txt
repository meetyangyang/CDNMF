Object detection is an important part of intelligent vehicle technologies;  which play an important role in car sharing services. Object detection provides metadata for collision avoidance;  self-driving systems;  and driver-assistance systems;  which can result in better safety and consumer experiences in car sharing services. Although deep learning has achieved an excellent performance in object detection;  they consume a large amount of storage and computing resource;  which makes them difficult to be deployed for car sharing services. This paper suggests a novel approach which is based on the generalized Haar filter and the local regression strategy. Our approach is accurate;  efficient;  and light. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in car sharing services.
