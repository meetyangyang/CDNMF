This paper is motivated by need of marine and offshore industry for automated solution for design appraisal. This paper aims to address this issue by using a machine learning-based approach. Some compliant and noncompliant designs are provided to a developed algorithm for a machine (or computer) to learn. After learning is completed, the machine is able to classify unseen designs as compliant or noncompliant. As highlighted in this paper, the developed method has demonstrated encouraging performance in two case studies, including specific parts in MARPOL and Rules of Lloydâ€™s Register. For adoption by industry, necessary steps include collecting some designs (compliant and noncompliant) available in an organization and feeding these into the developed method for learning by machine before it can predict. With ability of highlighting possible connections that cause noncompliance, follow up and correction on a noncompliant design is made possible.
