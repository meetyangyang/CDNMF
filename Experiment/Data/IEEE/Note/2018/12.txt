The basic motivation of this paper isto design an automated cost-effective, adaptive, and intelligentdefect detection and classification system that is easy to trainusing a small-size sample set of defects and that is robust tonoise. The system is scalable in terms of the numbers and typesof defects and features, which leads to a shorter developmentcycle. The presented system is immediately applicable to differenttypes of defects. Inputs of the system are grayscale images.These images are processed to perform defects detection, featuresextraction, and classification.
