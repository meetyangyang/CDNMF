In modern robotic assembly tasks, theindustrial robots often need to manipulate tiny objects withcomplex structure. Electrical connectors are a typical kindof these objects and widely used in many industrial fields.To avoid damaging the fragile connectors and accelerate theassembly process, it is required to promptly detect and isolatethe certain assembly fault in real time so that the robot canimmediately implement an error recovery procedure accordingto the identified fault. The proposed set-membership-based faultdetection and isolation (FDI) methodology satisfies both thetiming and fault-isolation requirements for this kind of roboticassembly task. In terms of the set-membership theory, no falsealarm will occur if there are sufficient training data for theproposed method. In addition, it turns out that the proposed method can signal an alarm faster than conventional residualbased FDI method from plentiful experiments. Although onlythe robotic assembly of electrical connectors is investigated, ourFDI method can also be applied in the assembly task of othersmall and complex parts. This is especially useful for increasingthe productivity and promoting the automation level of electronicindustries.
