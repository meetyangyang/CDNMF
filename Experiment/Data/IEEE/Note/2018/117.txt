Low-cost 3-D printers and 3-D printing of large models are two important but often conflicting goals in manufacturing industry. Usually low-cost devices such as DLP 3-D printer using an off-the-shelf consumer projector cannot print large models, due to the small projection area of the projector. In this paper, we propose to horizontally move the platform such that a large area can be printed by the composition of multiple small projection areas. Based on this new mechanism, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm to cover an arbitrary polygonal shape (possibly with holes or multiple disjoint polygons) by a small set of rectangles with fixed size. Our algorithm is theoretically sound and can be easily implemented. We built a physical prototype system of the proposed low-cost Delta DLP 3-D printer, which successfully prints several large models with satisfied mechanical properties.
