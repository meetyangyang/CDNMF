This paper deals with the uncertainty management problem of product disassembly. It builds some fuzzy programming models for product disassembly and proposes a hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating fuzzy simulation and artificial bee colony to solve them. Previously, such a problem was handled through a methodology based on stochastic planning, which was ineffective without considering the fuzzy characteristic of completing a disassembly task. The goal of this paper is to analyze the disassembly uncertainty feature from the perspective of fuzzy programming. Both theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly effective. The obtained results can help decision-makers better determine a disassembly process of a used/returned/obsolete product.
