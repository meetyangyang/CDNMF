This paper considers the problem offinding optimal locations for sensors for monitoring a spatialnetwork for moving targets (e.g., a road network with movingground targets or intruders). Sensor-based monitoring of a spatial region is relevant in a variety of applications (including,in general, such diverse application areas as traffic monitoringin transportation applications, intruder monitoring, surveillance,power systems monitoring, structural health monitoring, etc).This paper offers two primary novel aspects: an optimalitymetric formulation for target monitoring effectiveness on spatialnetworks and an iterative genetic algorithm-based method foroptimization of the sensor placement configuration. The proposedapproach enables addressing of multiple spatial criteria withina unified framework, including the probabilistic characterizationsof spatial target movements over the network and the modelsof relative importance/utility of different locations/areas in thespatial region.
