/i>\n—This paper was motivated by the collaborative budget allocation (CBA) problem in which either a user has limited ratings that can be distributed among items;  or a service has limited availability to all users in the sharing economy system. Existing approaches rarely consider this phenomenon in their collaborative prediction modeling;  which implies the geometric constraints on a user’s rating vector. This paper suggests a matrix factorization framework to address this problem by learning a group of a user profile as basis points that can be combined to recover other users’ rating vectors. Considering the noise in observed ratings in real applications;  we enhance the robustness of collaborative prediction by relaxing the recovery constraint. We then propose to specify the distance metric on the simplex from two perspectives;  and give the optimization approach. In the future research;  we will address the CBA in more complex settings;  for example;  some items can be substitutes or complementary for each other;  in this way;  how items can be better distributed among users is an interesting problem.
