We propose self-adaptive collective motion algorithms that enable swarm robots to move along a preplanned path from a source to a destination in 3-D space. Our algorithms use only one-hop neighbor information and operate without central controllers. The algorithms are designed to be self-adaptive in the sense that robots are able to dynamically determine proper moving parameters;  based on their environments and statuses. With the proposed algorithms;  swarm robots are able to: 1) maintain connectivity and a desired neighboring distance during movement; 2) bypass obstacles without member loss (i.e.;  the robot swarm is partitioned); and 3) be resistant to GPS errors and robot failures. We address both cases of with a leader and without a leader. Simulation results show effectiveness of our algorithms which can be applied in applications of surveillance;  search and rescue;  mining;  agricultural foraging;  autonomous military units;  and distributed sensing in micromachinery or human bodies.
