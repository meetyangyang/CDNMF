This paper presents a general mechanism of leader–follower consensus for the discontinuous communication of multivehicle wirelessly networked uncertain systemswith nonlinear dynamics and actuator fault. The proposedapproach guarantees that the consensus can be achieved forthe vehicles with nonlinear dynamics and unhealthy actuators.Specifically, the actuator behaviors include three types: miss,outage, and loss of effectiveness. More importantly, different fromthe existing works, the problems of leader–follower consensus,collision avoidance, and formulation control of multiple vehiclesare solved by the proposed protocols, which further demonstratethe ability to extend the service life of the systems with frequent actuators faults. In addition, the proposed intermittent communication strategy also addresses the limited power consumptionand the information interaction capability of each sensor.
