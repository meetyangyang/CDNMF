This paper was motivated by thelimitations of the existing indoor relocalization technology thatis significant for mobile robot navigation. Using this technology,robots can infer where they are in a previously visited place.Previous visual localization methods can hardly be put into wideapplication for the reason that they have strict requirements forthe environments. When faced with challenging scenes such aslarge-scale environments, dynamic objects, motion blur causedby fast movement, night-time environments, or other appearancechanged scenes, most existing methods tend to fail. This paperintroduces deep learning into the indoor relocalization problemand uses dual-stream CNN (depth stream and color stream) torealize 6-DOF pose regression in an end-to-end manner. Thelocalization error is about 0.3 m and 4Â° in a large-scale indoorenvironments. And what is more important, the proposed systemdoes not lose efficiency in some challenging scenes. The proposedencoding method of depth images can also be adopted in otherdeep neural networks with RGB-D cameras as the sensor.
