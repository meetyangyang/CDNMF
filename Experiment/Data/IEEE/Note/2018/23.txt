The ability to accurately and intuitivelycontrol the motion of miniaturized grippers in remote environments can open new exciting possibilities in the fields of minimallyinvasive surgery, micromanipulation, biopsy, and drug delivery.This paper presents a microteleoperation system with hapticassistance through which a clinician can easily control the motionand open/close capability of miniaturized wireless soft grippers.It introduces the underlying autonomous magnetic and thermalcontrol systems, their interconnection with the master hapticinterface, and an extensive evaluation in two real-world scenarios:1) following of a predetermined trajectory and 2) pick-and-placetask of a microscopic object.
