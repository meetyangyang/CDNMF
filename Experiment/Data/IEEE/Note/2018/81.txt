Pneumatic grippers are popular due to their low cost and simple structure. However;  it is difficult to control the gripping force to handle fragile objects without damage. The FRM has a small size and can be easily installed on pneumatic grippers to provide fast force regulation. The gripping force depends on axial preload of the FRM rather than air pressure of the gripper. Axial preload is passively regulated using a screw or spacer. No additional source of power or sensor is required. The FRM has a large force adjustment range and can grip objects of various sizes using the same force. Applications include the automation in electronics;  food;  agricultural;  and medical industries.
