This paper addresses the interestingproblem of making a good tradeoff between network traffic anddelay demand in a Web service-based control system setting.It helps to improve the operation efficiency of Internet ofThings systems that use the Web service technology to carry outcommunication between controllers and actuators while keepingdelay within a given range. Our simulation and experimentalinvestigations show that the solution developed here outperformscurrent solutions, such as time-driven or event-driven solutions.
