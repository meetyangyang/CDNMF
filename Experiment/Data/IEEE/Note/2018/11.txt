This paper addresses the critical problem of capturing process drifts from multidimensional (multisensor) data. The novelty of this paper is the development of a graphtheoretic approach that combines signals from multiple in situsensors for detecting abnormal process drifts. We show thatthis approach, which invokes graph-based topological invariantsinstead of statistical feature mining, is capable of capturingprocess drifts at an earlier stage (in terms of detection delayor lower average run length) and higher consistency of detectionthan conventional statistical features. As a practical consequenceof this research, the operator can track the status of a complexprocess in a tractable control chart setting with only two graphtheoretic topological invariants, as opposed to complex black-boxmodels involving several features.
