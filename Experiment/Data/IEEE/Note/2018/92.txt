This paper is motivated by the limited performance of skill transfer in the existing humanâ€“robot interfaces. Conventional robots perform tasks independently without interaction with humans. However, the new generation of robots with the characteristics, such as flexibility and compliance, become more involved in interacting with humans. Thus, advanced human robot interfaces are required to enable robots to learn human manipulation skills. In this paper, we propose a novel interface for human impedance adaptive skill transfer in a natural and intuitive manner. The developed interface has the following functionalities: 1) it transfers human arm impedance adaptive motion to the robot intuitively; 2) it senses human motion signals that are decoded into human hand gesture and arm endpoint stiffness that ia employed for natural human robot interaction; and 3) it provides human tutor haptic feedback for enhanced teaching experience. The interface can be potentially used in pHRI, teleoperation, human motor training systems, etc.
