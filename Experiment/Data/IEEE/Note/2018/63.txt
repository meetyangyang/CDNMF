This work was inspired by the fact thatthe capability of variable stiffness in the robot actuator canreduce the undesired impacts to the robot arms. It can alsoallow a safer interaction between robot and human. Grippingof objects with uncertainties in shapes and position, as wellas large variations in fragility and weight can also benefitfrom the concept of the variable stiffness. However, existingdesigns of variable stiffness grippers either have limited stiffnessrange or bulky configurations. They compromised the practicalapplications. This paper introduces a design in that a rotatingflexure hinge shaft is embedded inside the robotic gripper finger.The mechanical stiffness of such fingers can be varied bychanging the rotation angle of the flexure hinges. We presentthe working principle supported by mathematical models in thedesign and development. We also show an example design of a two-finger parallel gripper equipped with the VSFs. Extensiveexperiments demonstrated that the gripper is effective in grippingobjects with wide range of uncertainties. Such gripper designavoids the use of soft pads as well as closed-loop control andhigh-precision sensors. In the future work, we shall implementsuch grippers for actual industrial applications.
