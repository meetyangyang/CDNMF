In order to transition product fabrication from the design phase to manufacturing;  there is a need for identifying capable manufacturers with available resources that could be paired with user requirements. We propose Production as a Service (PaaS) in this paper and present initial implementations of the front-end and back-end components with a customizable optimization algorithm. Proposed abstractions and data structures make PaaS a unique;  efficient;  and intellectual property preserving framework. The current implementation of the framework has been tested with new designs. The PaaS framework has the potential to scale over a large network of manufacturers to effectively coordinate geo-distributed manufacturers for custom manufacturing needs.
