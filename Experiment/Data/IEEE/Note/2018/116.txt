Conventionally, industrial robots are used to perform repetitive tasks in human-free cages with minimal HRI for safety concerns. Thanks to the new safety and flexibility functions embedded in human-friendly manufacturing robots, humans and robots can now collaborate closely with each other accomplishing the tasks that were previously done by human workers solely. However, existing criteria for designing robot controllers need to be modified by considering the human workersâ€™ demands since the performance of a human worker would vary due to factors such as individual strength, working pattern, and interaction with the robot. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that integrates HRI factors in controlling the motion of a robot for the collaborative assembly tasks. Within this framework, the speed of robot can be controlled such that its motion progress synchronizes with that of the human during the task to improve pHRI. Moreover, for better sHRI, human trust in robot is calculated and used to select robot path and modify its speed control. Furthermore, we dynamically change the robot facial expression to provide visual feedbacks for performance and safety concerns. The results of the experimental study show that integrating both pHRI and sHRI in the robot controller leads to a significant drop of human perceived workload and considerable increase of robot usability and human trust in robot while the overall efficiency in terms of assembly time remains intact. For practical utilization in assembly plants, sensory devices for tracking the human motion are required. The robot is also required to have builtin safety functions that reduce the impact of possible collisions between the human and the robot. We believe that this paper addresses how the implementation of human-friendly robots in the manufacturing environments can improve HRI and reduce workload.
