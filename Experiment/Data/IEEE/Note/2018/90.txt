Attitude determination using vector observations can be applied in many areas. The most frequently involved are the accelerometerâ€“magnetometer combination and star tracker array. Based on the proposed efficient fast linear attitude estimator algorithm, the time consumption of the sensor fusion can be significantly reduced, saving the execution time for fault detection, fail safe, and so on.
