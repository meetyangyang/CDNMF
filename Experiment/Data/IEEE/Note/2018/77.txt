Lattice structures might fail to be fabricated by the additive manufacturing technique if the designed model exceeds the processability of the machine. Our approach has the capability of considering the manufacturing constraints in the design and optimization process. We conducted experiments to investigate the manufacturability and proposed a method that can give the domain of the design variables for a selected manufacturing process. And we also designed an algorithm that can optimize the lattice structure inside the domain of design variables. It ensures that the lattice model can be successfully fabricated by the selected process and the performance is dramatically increased compared to the original design. Engineers can use our approach to optimize the lattice structure automatically without knowing the knowledge of optimization and manufacturability.
