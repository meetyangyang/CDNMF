This paper studies combinatorial problems arising in multirobot systems that intend to sustain themselves using mechanisms for battery exchange. The ideas developed in this paper are broadly applicable to resource delivery and scheduling, closed-loop product supply management, and pickup and delivery problems for transportation. Many of the problems studied in this paper are generalizations of the traveling salesman problem. Simpler variants of these have been studied in operations research with the aim of finding optimal solutionsâ€”albeit in exponential time. However, in this paper, we present heuristic algorithms for solving battery exchange problems based on techniques developed in artificial intelligence and the design of approximation algorithms. Our algorithms have polynomial execution times and, therefore, scale very well with increasing size of the system. More expressive variants of battery exchange problems, with a broader class of constraints, must be addressed in the future. In addition, future research should also emphasize decentralized algorithms in order to encourage parallelism and exploit the computing power available on each individual robot.
