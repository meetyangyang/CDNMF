Developing feasible approaches foronline monitoring, fault detection, and fault isolation of complexhybrid and embedded systems, such as automobiles, aircraft,power plants, and manufacturing processes, is essential in securing their safe, reliable, and efficient operation. Frequent changesin the operational modes of these systems because of operatoractions, such as changing gears in an automobile, or environmental changes, such as driving on a wet or icy road make the faultdetection and isolation task in these systems challenging. It isimportant to detect and isolate faults in all the operating modes,and at the same time, not mistake a mode change as a fault inthe system. In this paper, we propose an approach that exploitsthe equation structure of hybrid systems behavior to combinemode detection and diagnosis in nonlinear hybrid systems. Theproposed algorithm is scalable and efficient. We demonstrate itseffectiveness using a case study of a reverse osmosis subsystemin an advances life support system for long duration mannedspace missions. Important challenges that can affect the successof our approach include the need for sufficiently detailed hybridmodels that capture nominal and faulty behavior, and a sufficientnumber of sensors to make simultaneous mode detection andfault isolation possible.
