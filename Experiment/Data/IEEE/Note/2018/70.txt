The main purpose of this paper is tosolve the gait pattern mismatch problem when different peoplewear an lower limb exoskeleton robot. The gait patterns aredifferent for each individual, and the main gait-related factorsinclude body parameters and walking speed (WS). Therefore,the suitable gait pattern for the wearer is predicted according totheir body parameters and target WS in this paper. The detailedprediction process and a full analysis of experimental results are also given. Finally, the generated gait patterns are successfullyverified on the lower limb exoskeleton robot.
