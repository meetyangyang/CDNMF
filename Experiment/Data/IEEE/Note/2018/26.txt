In-field cultivar identification remainsan open question for industrial applications in agriculture. Thispaper describes a practical computer vision system to explorethe feasibility for automatic maize cultivar identification. Oursystem shows potentials to be applied in an embedded system aslong as convolutional models could be compressed to addressstorage issues. Aside from using the fixed image acquisitiondevice mentioned in this paper, another promising way is tointegrate our system into an unmanned aircraft to achieve flexiblefield-based observations.
