This paper is motivated by the problem of robust magnetic microrobot control for in vivo medical applications and micromanipulation. Existing approaches do not account for navigation system uncertainty, and rely on high imaging rates that are unrealistic for some applications (e.g., involving X-rays). We investigate the uncertainties in magnetic force generation and fluidic forces for microdevices that move in viscous fluid, considering state-of-the-art electromagnetic control systems capable of 5 degree-of-freedom control. These systems have not been examined before from this perspective. We demonstrate how to estimate the uncertainty in electromagnetic force generation due to localization and calibration inaccuracies, as well as the uncertainty in drag force due to microrobot shape complexity. Finally, we show that we can robustly control permanent magnetic microrobots in low viscosity oils, thus enabling more accurate and less restricted manipulation.
