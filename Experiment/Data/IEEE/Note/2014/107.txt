Automatic made-to-measure for mass customization has become one of the important developments for the apparel industry. 3D body scanning technologies are used to capture a virtual clone of an individual human body model for mass customization. However, these methods have failed to overcome two critical problems. First, the extremely expensive cost of the equipment prevents it from wide applications in garment industry. Second, the data format either in the original point clouds or simplified mesh models is not easily to be linked to a parametric model, which can be automatically modified to different shapes by the user parameter inputs. For this reason, this paper intended to build a parametric human body model, which can represent an individual body by inputting some key dimensions which is more than the traditional manual measures but drastically fewer than the 3D body scanner data.
