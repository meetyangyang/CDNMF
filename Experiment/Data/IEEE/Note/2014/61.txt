This paper is motivated by the optimalcontrol problem for a class of switched systems subject to actuators saturation. Actuator saturation is often encountered in practical applications due to the fact that it is usually impossible toimplement unlimited control signals, and is frequently one of themain sources of instability, degradation of system performance ofa control system. In addition, the traditional dynamic programming technique because of the “curse of dimensionality” cannothandled effectively the optimal control problems for switched systems. Therefore, in this paper, a new iterative two-stage DHP algorithm is proposed to deal with the optimal control problem fora class of switched systems subject to actuators saturation. Thisstudy presents the method for practitioners interested in developing optimal controller design for the switched systems subjectto actuators saturation.
