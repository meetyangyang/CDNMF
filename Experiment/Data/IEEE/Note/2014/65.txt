To address the challenge of the automaticcomposition of web services in a large scale, this work proposes anovel approach to find top- solutions with optimal global QoS.The problem of service composition is transformed into a graphsearching problem. Each composition solution is represented in theform of a directed acyclic graph. The approach is divided into twostages, i.e., the run-up stage and the composition stage. Run-upstage deals with data preprocessing to parse service repository,which can be executed offline. In the composition stage, top- compositions in response to usersâ€™ queries are generated in parallel.
