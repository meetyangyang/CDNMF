Most of the existing methods for assembly planning are applicable to simple products with less number of parts, and still, the modeling processes usually need manual interventions. These methods are impractical to deal with the assembly planning for complex products. The primary purpose of this study is to propose a new approach applied to generate the exploded views of the assembly plans of complex products. The developed approach is in particular suitable to products with inclined assembly planes. The corresponding algorithm has been proven reliable and having better visualization performance in comparison with the results from existing algorithms and other commercial tools. It can be used as a standalone software tool or as an add-on tool to commercial CAD systems. As a part of the critical components of an integrated assembly planning system, the algorithm has been applied in assembly planning of aero-plane products including aero-engines.
