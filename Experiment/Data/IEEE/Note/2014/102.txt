This paper describes the design principles of a pulsed laser apparatus that emulates the emission of radioactivity. The device allows one to experiment with methods for radiation detection and measurement without the need to handle and store potentially hazardous radioactive material. From the perspective of a user that counts events (rather than in terms of the physical signal expressing the energy deposited on the sensor) the experimental apparatus described here behaves very similarly to a pair of radioactive source and Geiger counter.
