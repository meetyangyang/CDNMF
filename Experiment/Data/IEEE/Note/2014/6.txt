With increasing automation and complexity to achieve desired performance, complex engineeringsystems become increasingly vulnerable to unpredictable faultsthat can cause undesired behaviors and damage to the systems.Therefore, how to handle faults plays an increasing role in modernengineering systems, where many highly automated componentsinteract in a complex way such that a fault in a single componentmay cause the malfunction of the whole system. Many of thesecomplex engineering systems, such as manufacturing systems,communication protocols, and reactive software are typically governed by operational rules that can be modeled by discrete-eventsystems. Hence, we need to investigate fault-tolerant controlfor discrete-event systems. This paper discusses how to controldiscrete-event systems with faults to ensure safety which is thebasic and critical property of engineering systems. The resultsprovide methodologies for us to analyze and design fault-tolerantengineering systems.
