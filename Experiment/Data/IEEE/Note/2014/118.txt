Semiconductor manufacturing in complicated nanotechnology is facing tough challenge for quick response to yield excursion for shortening time to market and reducing the cost to maintain competitive advantages. Due to the increasing complexity of nanotechnology for wafer fabrication, increasingly high inspection costs and yield loss associated with defective wafers have become a critical concern of semiconductor manufacturers. Focused on real settings of practical industrial experiments, this study provides a novel approach to searching similar WBMs from huge wafer spatial data to quickly identify potential causes for yield enhancement. This approach was validated in real setting in Taiwan and the results showed its practical viability.
