 DP services are common nowadays, and there are a huge number of DP services in the Internet-scale environment. Locating an appropriate DP service accurately and efficiently with respect to the requirements of a certain requestor is a challenging task. This work presents a novel clustering-oriented approach, which aims to group DP services into clusters offline leveraging the semantic description of these DP services, and provides operations for managing these clusters. The clustering procedure is conducted by means of a machine learning technique which is a refined fuzzy -means method. A DP service can be assigned to one or several clusters with certain degrees. DP service clusters constitute a cluster network. Operations are provided for facilitating the evolution of cluster network, when a DP service emerges or disappears sometime for some reason. A prototype has been implemented and the approach has been evaluated on two test collections of DP services considering factors impacting the efficiency. Our method can be readily used in industrial DP service repository for supporting DP service discovery and replacement.
