This paper presents a method useful forthe development of automated video surveillance systems. The current generation of video surveillance systems is geared towardsrecognizing actions of interest (such as tampering with infrastructure, drawing graffiti, looking inside a car, etc.) automatically fromvideo streams. To this aim, computer algorithms can be employedto learn to recognize such actions simply from presentation of example videos. However, the learning time can prove excruciatinglyhigh, up to the order of days or weeks of computing time dependingon the size of the dataset. This paper presents two methods to dramatically reduce such a learning time. The main practical advantage is the rapid reconfigurability of the video surveillance systemto recognize new and different action types arising from differentscenarios of application.
