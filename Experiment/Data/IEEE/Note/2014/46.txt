Automated industrial assembly systemsoften take streams of unoriented parts as input, which are orientedby feeders. Many of the feeders reject all parts but those which reston one desired face after falling into the feeder. The probabilitythat a part settles on the right face has a dramatic effect on the efficiency of the feeder. In this paper, I create a dataset on the behaviorof irregularly shaped parts by computer simulation. I compare thedataset to the predictions of simple estimators of these probabilities. Finally, I design a new estimator, which enables the quickand reliable prediction of the probabilities without the need to perform repeated experiments or computer simulations with every individual part. The new estimator is useful in those situations whereother methods are too slow. For example, it can supply the user ofcomputer-aided design software with continuous, feedback on the“feedability” of the part being designed.
