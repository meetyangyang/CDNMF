In the process industry, the productquality reflects the operational and economic performance ofa manufacturing process. However, online measurement andcontrol of product quality is generally difficult. In this paper, adata-driven soft-sensor is proposed to online estimate the productquality for a typical grinding process with time-varying dynamics.The method combines an improved CBR soft-sensor algorithmand a feature weighting algorithm using fuzzy-similarity roughsets. First, the weighs of case features in CBR are determinedusing the fuzzy-similarity rough sets in offline mode, and then theyare used in CBR to accurately estimate the PPS online. The CBRsoft-sensor system has been applied in a large industrial grindingplant. The application results show that the soft-sensor systemhas achieved satisfied estimation precision, good adaptability and robustness, and can be easily realized in practice with low costand maintenance.
