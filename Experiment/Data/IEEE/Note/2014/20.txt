A number of tasks in the mining and construction industries require operators to handle explosives as a finished product. The most common one is blast hole charging, whichinvolves the placement of a primer-detonator assembly at the endof a flexible hose and inserting the hose into a blast hole. Joint research and development efforts pioneered in Australia by CSIROand mining industry partners advanced the state of the art in theautomation of blast holes charging to new heights. This paper describes the results of this work: a new system that is capable of surveying the holes in the drilling pattern using a laser scanner, matchthem against a pre-loaded blast plan, position the primer-denotator assembly to the hole and align for insertion, and then executethe insertion.
