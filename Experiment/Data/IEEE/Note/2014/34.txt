- This paper deals with scheduling a sequence of tasks for a radar system in a limited time-window. Previous work in the literature has addressed this problem by modeling each task as having a fixed duration. In an earlier paper of one of the authors;  the task duration was modeled as a variable;  which allowed for some flexibility in the task duration;  enabling enhanced utilization of the radar timeline. However;  a simplified radar task model was used that did not account for the internal structure of a radar task. This work adds a practical dimension by further extending the radar task model to allow for some flexibility in the task duration and also explicitly account for the internal structure of the task. It is shown that utilization of the radar timeline can be thus enhanced through monitoring the interplay of adjusting the dwell times of the internal components of a task.
