Wind energy has been developed extensively during recent years, due to concerns about emissions fromfossil fuel resources. Many new wind farms will employ wind turbines based on doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG), to realizevariable-speed constant-frequency wind energy generation. Thesystems need to reduce wear and tear of generating units undernormal grid conditions, and reduce rotor over-current underunbalanced grid conditions to improve their ability to withstandgrid voltage faults. Modeling such systems is the key issue, sincethe dynamics of DFIG under normal conditions and unbalancedconditions are quite different. This paper proposes a nonlinearmodeling technique that considers both grid balanced and unbalanced conditions. A nonlinear model predictive controller isderived for power control of DFIG. Simulation results show theeffectiveness of the proposed nonlinear model predictive controltechnique.
