In the manufacturing industry, there isa demand to measure workpiece for quality control. A Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) is usually used. However, itspointwise measurement makes the inspection time consuming andcannot do 100% inspection for all the parts. Vision-based 3D reconstruction method could measure the parts quickly. But the methodis weak against optically challenging objects. To this end, this paperproposed a robust surface coding method to measure the opticallychallenging object via a vision-based method.
