People have long realized the importance of having sensor or measurement redundancy in a system as this redundancy safeguards the system against sensor failures or measurement anomalies, so much so that the degree of redundancy is a reflection of the system’s reliability or fault-tolerance capability. Because of dependence relationship among the system’s components or subsystems, computing the degree of redundancy is not a straightforward matter for practical systems which embed certain structure. Our paper presents an enhanced version of an existing method as well as a novel hybrid algorithm to calculate degree of redundancy, which are significantly faster than the existing methods in many cases. These algorithms are a step forward in addressing this challenging problem.
