Autonomous vehicle-based storage andretrieval (AVS/R) systems represent a promising technology tohandle palletized unit loads in a warehouse. Due to potentialflexibility offered by this technology, it is being investigated asan alternative technology to traditional crane-based systems inmany applications. However, analytical models are required tohelp develop design insights that will allow practitioners to designefficient systems that satisfy throughput, cycle time and flexibilityrequirements of particular application. This paper develops efficient analytical models to evaluate system performance undervarious configurations. A distinguishing aspect of this researchis that it captures the effect of vehicle blocking on system performance. The results show that blocking effects could be significantin many cases and provide design insights that would be useful inminimizing blocking effects and improving system performance.
