-To develop FlexRay-based distributedsystems, engineers need tools for schedulability analysis to beable to assert that a given network configuration parameters, e.g.,frames priority and periodicity, meet the timing requirements oftheir distributed application (no deadline misses). Achieving thistask includes the ability to compute the end-to-end delay of everyframe. Practitioners can find in this paper an efficient method forprecisely computing the worst-case response time, which is a significant part of the en-to-end-delay, of FlexRay frames scheduledin the dynamic segment. The solution can be easily implementedin FlexRay networks schedulability analysis tools.
