The establishment of deadlock-freeresource allocation is a prominent problem that underlies thebehavioral dynamics of many contemporary applications ofautomation science and engineering. Ideally, one would like toestablish the aforementioned deadlock freedom while imposingthe minimum possible restriction to the underlying resourceallocation function. The results presented in this paper facilitatethe deployment of such minimally restrictive solutions to thedeadlock avoidance problem for applications of practical size andbehavioral complexity.
