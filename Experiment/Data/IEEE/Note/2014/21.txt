The key issue of the cigarette productionscheduling problem is to effectively schedule the primary processing line, cut-tobacco silos, and cigarette making machines. Inmany tobacco companies, these steps are done manually basedon experiences. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodto schedule these components by combining a workflow modeland an immune algorithm. The model and algorithm are used tomodel cigarette production process and find a good schedulingsolution, respectively. The advantage of such model is that it hasan intuitive structure that is easily used by industrial practitioners.It is also convenient to use the model to describe more complexproblems because of its description capability. The algorithmcan find activity priorities quickly, and then dispatching rulescombined with these priorities are used to schedule resources in areal-time manner. This approach can greatly improve the qualityof scheduling scheme, and reduce the time spent in finding one.
