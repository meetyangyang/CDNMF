â€“ This paper proposes an efficient simulation procedure to rank all alternatives completely. The methodology can be applied to any simulation project where the completeranking information is needed. For example, decision makers mayneed the complete ranking information to make tradeoff amongmultiple selection criteria. The procedure can also be incorporatedinto an evolutionary algorithm to enhance the efficiency of the selection process in stochastic optimization problems. We have numerically shown that our procedure reduces simulation budget significantly while achieving a high probability of correct ranking.
