This paper was motivated by the problemof inspecting inconsistently illuminated steel surfaces on a bridgestructure using a robot manipulator. Existing approaches forcolor-based surface classification are susceptible to illuminationvariance. This paper proposes the use of diffused reflectancevalues, which combines the use of color and depth data to improveaccuracy. In this approach, the diffused reflectance values of eachimage pixel are calculated by using the distance and angle between the surface represented by a pixel and the light source. Thediffused reflectance values are calculated in each color channel(Red, Green, Blue) to provide three features to classify differentsurface-types. This proposed approach can be applied to surface classification tasks where the light source does not uniformlyilluminate the scene in the image.
