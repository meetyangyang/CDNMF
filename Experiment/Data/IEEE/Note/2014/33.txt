Due to the rapid development of sensortechnology, DSN has been widely used to monitor process changein complex manufacturing systems. Unlike most of the previousstudies on the optimal design of a sensor system, which assumethat sensor layout is fixed once sensors are deployed in the DSN,this paper proposes a novel adaptive strategy to update the sensorlayout or determine the operating mode (i.e., active/sleep state) ofeach sensor during online measurements. Two fundamental questions have been addressed in this study: (i) when to reallocate sensors and (ii) how to update sensor layout. The proposed methodology is especially beneficial for monitoring the process change ina system where variable relationships can be modeled with a BNand a single mean shift may occur at any variable. To implementthis methodology, it is necessary: (i) to identify the physical variables associated with the production system; (ii) to describe thevariable relationships via a BN; and (iii) to determine the numberof available sensors with the consideration of budget, bandwidth,or energy constraint. Experimental studies have shown that theproposed adaptive strategy has better performance than the fixed strategy in terms of improving detection delay and fault diagnosisaccuracy.
