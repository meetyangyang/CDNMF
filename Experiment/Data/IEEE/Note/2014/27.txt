This work addresses crack detection andmapping on a bridge deck using a robotic system. Several challenges including coordinate transformation, robot localization andcomplete coverage path planning for the proposed robot systemare tackled. This paper focuses mainly on the overall frameworkfor such a robotic inspection system, therefore some of the techniques for handling shadows, paints, patches on bridges are not addressed. In real-world applications, these issues should be carefullyincorporated into the design of the image processing algorithm.Also, there may be vibration caused by the passing traffic, whichshould be dealt with as well. The positioning of the ROCIM systemis critical to crack mapping, hence more accurate robot localizationtechniques fusing various sensors such as differential GPS, InertialMeasurement Unit (IMU), etc. should be developed. It is also worthnoting that the depth and severity of the cracks can be measuredby employing advanced nondestructive evaluation (NDE) sensors,such as impact echo and ultrasonic surface wave.
