We present in this paper a technique thatwill greatly improve the performance, both in time and precision,of change detection in environments. The main motivation wasthe increasing use of 3D point clouds in mapping and securitytasks, where need arises for efficient comparison of two sets. Ourrepresentation, based on density calculation and 3D Gaussiansmoothing, transforms the raw data into a continuous 3D densityfield, upon which Boolean operations is used to express the conceptof change detection between the two clouds. Without making anyassumptions as to how the data were acquired, our method accomplishes otherwise complex operation in a simple way, leadingto both robustness of results and increased computational speed.
