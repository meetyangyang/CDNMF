Numerical optimization algorithms aregenerally inevitable in solving optimal design problems of parallelmanipulators. Various algorithms have been applied in literatureand in engineering. This paper provides a thorough comparison onconvergence performance of typical optimization algorithms, SQPwith multiple initial points, CRS, GA, DE, and PSO. Two parallelmanipulators, the Delta robot and the Goughâ€“Stewart platform,are used as design examples by maximizing the effective regularworkspace. Computation shows that DE and PSO are good choicesfor complicated optimal design problems, while SQP with multipleinitial points is superior for simple problems. CRS performs excellently in the starting period. It can be used to generate good initialpoints.
