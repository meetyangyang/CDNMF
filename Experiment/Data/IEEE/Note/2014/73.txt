This paper was motivated by the critical demand within the manufacturing industry to meet the High-Mix, Low-Volume requirements for the changing consumer marketdemands. A fully robotic manufacturing process cannot obtainsufficient flexibility with a highly variable product line. Therefore,it must aim towards a complimentary cost-effectiveness to improveproductivity from other ways. By taking advantage of a  human's adaptability and flexibility, we can exploit the concept of a hybridassembly system for medium sized manufacturing processes. Hybrid assembly creates a modern assembly mode where the robotworks as co-worker to collaborate with the human and share thesame working space and time. Hybrid assembly cell emphasizestwo challenging issues to somehow improve the manufacturingproductivity: (1) the way of describing and modeling humanand robot collaboration and coordination, and (2) the effectivetask scheduling and allocation strategy for human and robot.This research is focused on the subtask allocation method whileconsidering the features of human and robot collaboration. Theoriginal contribution of this work is the design of an offline andonline resource constraint project scheduling problem (RCPSP)algorithm for hybrid assembly systems. The resource is not onlylimited to the recycle resource, but also extend to the features ofhuman and robot, such as human fatigue issues, and robot assembly failure issues. This RCPSP for hybrid assembly is to realizeboth sequential and parallel task scheduling between human andseveral robots while minimizing the assembly time and payment cost. This algorithm is fast in reaching the semi-optimal solution,therefore it can be used for both offline and online situations.The simulation results demonstrates the effectiveness of this taskscheduling algorithms. We believe this study is helpful to improvethe productivity for hybrid assembly system.
