Product assembly modeling is of fundamental significance in successful implementation of digitalassembly technologies. Complex products such as automobilesor airplanes have thousands or even millions of parts. The combination explosion due to a large number of components is anunavoidable issue in assembly planning. The proposed method integrates the object-oriented method with the knowledge templateapproach. This new method makes it possible to simplify assemblymodeling, reuse existing parts or components, support geographically distributed collaboration, and reduce the design time greatly.The method has been implemented and its performance has beenverified in the assembly planning of some aero-plane productsincluding aero-engines. It can be easily applied to automatedassembly planning of other complex products.
