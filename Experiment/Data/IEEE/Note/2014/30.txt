Two-dimensional shape deformation canapproximately imitate an object’s change and has been used widelyin graphic applications. This paper was motivated by the problemthat in the fashion industry a design must be repeatedly sketchedfor varied presentation purposes. We present an automatic and effective method to create realistic fashion sketches with full colorand details, from technical drawings of the products (“flats”). Themethod helps designers efficiently present their ideas in a professional manner, detect any inappropriateness in the designs, provideinstant feedbacks on design and presentation, and thus acceleratethe design process. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach is feasible. In future research, we will address the problemof rotation and incorporate other textile material properties to improve the sketch deformation results.
