This paper was motivated by the problemof measuring a machined part and assessing the part compliancewith tolerance specifications in dimensional inspection usingCMMs. In coordinate measurements, there is an importanttradeoff between the number of inspected points and inspectiontime. Therefore, it is important to determine optimal locationson the part to be inspected in order to gain maximum part information out of limited number of points. Given these limitednumber of measurement points, it is also important and challenging to decide the part acceptance reliably. This paper proposesa wavelet-based model for CMM measurements. The proposedmodel provides practitioners with the optimal sampling positionsand the estimated form error given the sampled measurementpoints. While traditional methods often suffer from the underestimation of the form error, the proposed method estimates the formerror unbiasedly with even a small number of measurements.The proposed method can be easily implemented using existingwavelet software packages. Even though this paper was motivatedby issues that arise with CMM measurements, the methodologycan be easily adapted to a wide range of industrial applicationswhere taking measurements is expensive.
