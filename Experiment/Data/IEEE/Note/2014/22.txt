The Operating Theater (OT) is often considered hospitals’ biggest budget consumer and revenue center ina hospital. This paper was motivated by a project that aims to reduce expenses and surgery waiting lists in Portuguese public hospitals, by developing an Intelligent Decision Support System (DSS)to support surgery scheduling.Prior to this research, decision makers (Surgeons, Departmentmanagers, Operating theatre managers) used their experience tomake allocation, scheduling and estimation decisions. Since manyof these decisions are made without analyzing past results, mistakes occur frequently, affecting the OT performance. With thehelp of business intelligence, data mining and optimization algorithms, surgeons’ estimations can be more precise and the operating room schedule can be optimized.Preliminary experiments on the usage of DSS reveal a remarkable increase of the efficiency of the whole OT. In future research,we will extend the DSS and the techniques used to address the tactical master surgery scheduling problem, which aims to perform abetter allocation of the different specialties to the operating roomsalong the week. In addition, upstream and downstream resourcesshall be considered in the optimization module, as well as a simulation component to better evaluate generated solutions.
