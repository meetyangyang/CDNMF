Given that the byproduct gas system insteel industry can hardly be described by a physics or mechanismbased model, its balance scheduling is widely realized by the experience based manual measure at present. A large number of realtime energy data have been accumulated by the SCADA systemimplemented in most of steel plants, hence a novel data-drivenreal-time scheduling is proposed, which takes the experienced operations as the sample data for depicting the dynamics among theenergy units. The proposed method aims at the short term dynamicscheduling, which can provide the optimized solution via monitoring the circumstances of the gas system. Therefore, it is requiredfor the plant in advance to implement the SCADA system for theenergy data management, and the sampling interval should be lessthan or equal to 1 minute. And, it is necessary for the sample datato complete the preliminary processing such as eliminating the industrial noises or perform the data imputation if needed. Becausesuch preliminary processing for the sample data belongs to a classof generic methods, this work avoids the redundant technical introduction.
