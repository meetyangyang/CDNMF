The usual approach to the design of manufacturing systems is to model the desired closed-loop system behavior using, for example, Petri nets, and in the sequel to extractthe discrete-event controller from this model with the view to implementing the control logic on a Programmable Logic Controller(PLC). So far, the controller extraction is carried out in an ad hocand intuitive way. In order to overcome the lack of formal methodsto deal with controller extraction and implementation, we proposehere a set of rules to construct, in a systematic way, the ladder diagram that implements the discrete-event controller. We illustratethe conversion technique proposed here by applying it to the implementation of the automation system of a plastic molding machine.
