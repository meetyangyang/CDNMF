This paper was motivated by competitionand demand for consistent and high-quality product for industrial manufacturing processes with multiphase characteristics.Industrial experts have noted that events taking place in differentphases may have different impacts on the final product yield andquality. Phase-based quality prediction has drawn their attentionby providing quality information before the end of processes. Thispaper suggests an automatic sequential phase partition algorithmfor phase-based regression modeling and quality prediction whichcan identify phases in sequence from the quality-relevant perspective. The division result is easy to read and does not need aheavy postprocessing as what is done for clustering-based result.The phase information is identified in order by directly relatingchanges of process characteristics with their influence on qualityprediction performance. More accurate regression models andonline quality prediction results can thus be readily obtained.Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach is feasiblebut it has not yet been incorporated into a quality control systemnor tested in practical industrial production. In future research, we will address the design of phase-based quality prediction andcontrol system that can be put into online application.
