This paper was motivated by the desire for a practical control algorithm for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles. While many examples of controllers with strong stability and/or performance guarantees exist, these controllers have limited application due to complicated control structures making adjustment in the field difficult. PID controllers, however, can be simply tuned but lack stability or performance guarantees. The controller we present is similar to PID controllers with respect to ease of tuning, but also has a mathematical foundation for determining gains to give guaranteed performance in uncertain environments. The controller is tested to demonstrate performance in a lab environment with position updates limited to 10 Hz and 2 cm standard deviation noise added to approximate GPS or vision-based control scenarios.
