In an actual industrial process, the dynamic behaviors is complex and nonlinear, and their mathematicalmodels are often difficult to obtain. How to design the controller forunknown nonlinear systems using input/output (I/O) data has become one main focus of control researches. Therefore, in this paper,two adaptive observer-based data-driven control algorithms areproposed for a class of unknown nonlinear systems. Finally, the effectiveness of two control strategies are illustrated via simulationstudy and experimental test.
