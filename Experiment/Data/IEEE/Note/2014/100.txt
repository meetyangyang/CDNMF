Automated electroplating lines with material handling hoists are widely used in the manufacture of many electronic or mechanical products. The higher productivity of these systems could be achieved by optimizing the sequence of the hoist moves. This paper presents an improved mixed integer programming (MIP) approach for the multi-hoist cyclic scheduling problem. In contrast with most previous approaches, our MIP approach can always find a globally optimal hoist schedule with the maximum productivity. The improved MIP approach can be easily implemented using a commercial optimization software package, such as ILOG CPLEX. The optimal hoist schedule obtained with our approach can be used to control the hoist operations via a programmable logic controller.
