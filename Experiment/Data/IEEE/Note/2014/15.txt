Global optimization problems raise inmany engineering and automation applications, and are generallychallenging to solve. Examples include those in manufacturing,logistics, semiconductors, healthcare delivery, etc. Random searchalgorithms provide an effective alternative to tackle the problems.A class of these algorithms is partition-based, meaning the solutionspace is partitioned into subsets in each iteration and samplesfrom each subset are used to determine promising subsets to focusthe search on. An intelligent strategy for allocating the samplebudget can achieve a more efficient utilization of the limited computing resources. The optimal sample allocation strategy (OSAS)proposed in this paper is a very useful addition to the existingprocedures of partition-based random search. OSAS can increasethe probability of choosing the correct subset as a promisingone in each iteration, or achieve the same confidence level usingfewer samples. Thus, it improves algorithm performance andconvergence speed, and provides better solution quality. The procedure is easy to implement, and therefore is a good choice insolving practical problems, such as the buffer allocation problemin manufacturing which is demonstrated in this paper.
