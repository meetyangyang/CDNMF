This paper is motivated by the stabilization problem occurring in the acceleration-minimizing solutionsfor redundant robot manipulators. High joint velocity/acceleration and non-zero final joint velocity (to some extent, termed instabilities), which are caused via acceleration-minimizing synthesization, are not suitable for real-time motion control of robots. Thispaper proposes an optimal control scheme that combines MKE andMAN criterions via two weighting factors to remedy the aforementioned problems caused by the conventional MAN control schemein redundant robot manipulators. Computer simulation results ofa PUMA560 robot manipulator show that the proposed scheme canachieve superior performance; i.e., the final joint velocity of motionis near zero. Moreover, all joint variables have small values, arekept within their physical limits, and have not undergone abruptchanges (or chattering phenomena). The proposed scheme is applied to a six-link planar robot manipulator to verify further theeffectiveness and physical realizability of such a scheme.
