The biologically inspired robots have beenresearched and developed intensely. Many researchers expect that thelocomotion of living things has high locomotion performance in the naturalworld, because they have survived by natural selection. However, whenwe consider the effectiveness of imitating the biological locomotion, it isimportant that we clarify not only the kinematical and dynamical featuresof the locomotion but also the principle of the locomotion, which meansthe reason why a living thing achieved the locomotion. We expect thatthe knowledge regarding the principle of the locomotion suggests a moreeffective motion pattern which is specific to mechanical robots. In thisstudy, we focus on the creeping locomotion of a living snake. Practicallythe great ability of movement of a living snake is useful, for example,search and rescue missions at disaster sites, so snake-like robots have beendeveloped. Based on the hybrid model, we discuss the optimal locomotionof the snake robot with comparing locomotion of a living snake.
