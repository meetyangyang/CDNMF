Noncooperative zero-sum differentialgame provides an ideal tool to study multiplayer optimal decisionand control problems. Existing approaches usually solve the Nashequilibrium solution by means of offline iterative computation,and require the exact knowledge of the system dynamics. However,it is difficult to obtain the exact knowledge of the system dynamicsfor many real-world industrial systems. The algorithm developed in this paper is a fully model-free method which solves thezero-sum differential game problem forward in time by makinguse of online measured data. This method is not affected by errorsbetween an identification model and a real system, and respondsfast to changes of the system dynamics. Exploration signals arerequired to satisfy the persistence of excitation condition to updatethe value function and the policies, and these signals do not affectthe convergence of the learning process. The least squares methodis used to obtain the approximate solution for the zero-sum gameswith unknown dynamics. The developed algorithm is appliedto a load-frequency controller design for a power system whoseparameters are not known a priori. In future research, we willextend the results to zero-sum and nonzero-sum differential gameswith completely unknown nonlinear continuous-time dynamics.
