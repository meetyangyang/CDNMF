 Manufacturing systems are becomingmore and more flexible. Many manufacturing systems can makemultiple products on the same production line. Analyzing the performance of such systems is of significant importance for systemdesign, control, and improvement. In many multiproduct systems,machines are unreliable and may have different processing ratesfor different products, and the buffers are finite and shared forall types of products. However, the current literature does notprovide effective method to analyze the performance of suchsystems. This paper presents an analytical method by aggregatingdifferent product types into a virtual one and approximatingline performance recursively. In addition, bottleneck analysisis introduced to identify the bottleneck machine and productimpeding the system throughput in the strongest manner throughindicators based on the data collected on the factory floor. Such amethod provides a quantitative tool for production engineers andmanagers to design, operate, and improve flexible manufacturingsystems.
