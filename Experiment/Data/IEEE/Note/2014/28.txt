Analyzing patient flow plays an important role in improving the performance of healthcare deliverysystems. In emergency department and many clinics, the caredelivery services within the patient rooms comprise the majoritypart of patientâ€™s length of stay. It involves multiple services bya limited number of care providers or equipments (physicians,nurses, lab tests, etc.). However, no analytical model exists tostudy such processes with necessary details in the current literature. In this paper, to analyze the patient flow within patientrooms, a Markov chain model is presented and then extended toaddress non-Markovian cases. Using such a model, the healthcareprofessionals can evaluate different scenarios corresponding tocapacity planning, workforce configuration, and service delivery,etc. This provides a quantitative tool for operation improvementin healthcare delivery systems.
