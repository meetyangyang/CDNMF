The VRP is a well-known operations research model for a class of transportation and logistics management problems in industrial systems. Large-scale problems arise inpractice in production systems, e.g., charge planning, casting planning, and rolling planning in an iron-steel making process, whichcan be formulated as variants of the VRP model. This paper ismotivated by practical needs for clean production and cost-savings, lower carbon emission policies and the observation that mostVRP models neglect the effect of the cargo weight on the totalcosts. The WVRP model incorporates the cargo weight into theoptimization objective function, resulting in an exact formulation. This model can be applied to logistics and transportation management problems in industrial systems and is particularly usefulgiven the mandatory lower carbon emissions policy. The WVRPmodel results in higher cost savings than traditional VRP modelsfor instances with a dispersed customer distribution and a largeweight. The BEAM-MMAS algorithm combines beam search andMAX-MIN ant systems and has been shown to be an effective algorithm for solving such problems; this algorithm can be used to ensure high quality solutions for medium-scale problems. For largescale problems, the MMAS algorithm can produce a satisfactorysolution in less time than the BEAM-MMAS algorithm.
