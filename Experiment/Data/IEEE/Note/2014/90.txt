This paper is motivated by the problem of turning and welding of a custom-built all position autonomous mobile welding robot system. This type of welding is pervasive in the metal fabrication industry. But to produce smooth fillet welding while the mobile vehicle turns simultaneously proves to be challenging. This paper presents two optimization models that calculate the best initial position and the turning radius of the robot vehicle, respectively. Furthermore, global optimal solution is obtained through model optimization. The proposed motion planning method effectively deals with the problem of turning welding, and provides a reliable theoretical basis for complex all-position welding operations.
