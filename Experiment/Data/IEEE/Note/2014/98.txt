The motivation for this paper stems from the need to develop path planning algorithms for small UAVs with resource constraints. Small autonomous UAVs are seen as ideal platforms for many monitoring applications. Small UAVs can fly at low altitudes and can avoid obstacles or threats at low altitudes more easily. These vehicles can also be hand launched by an individual without any reliance on a specific type of terrain. Even though there are several advantages with using small platforms, they also come with other resource constraints due to their size and limited payload. This paper addresses a path planning problem involving a small UAV with fuel constraints, and presents fast and efficient algorithms for finding good feasible solutions.
