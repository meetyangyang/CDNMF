Driving a system to a known state whenits current state is not known is a very important problem in manypractical applications, such as checking communication protocols,part orienteers, digital reset circuit, etc. This topic has receiveda lot of attention in the past few decades. The classic approachto solve this problem considers systems modeled by automata. Inparticular, a standard technique requires the computation of asynchronizing sequence, i.e., a sequence of inputs that drives thesystem to a unique final state independently of the initial state anddoes not require the observation of the systemâ€™s outputs.This paper presents a first investigation on the computation ofsynchronizing sequences for systems modeled by synchronizedPetri nets. Petri nets are a very intuitive model that is widely usedin automation. Many analysis problems can be efficiently solvedusing Petri nets by taking into account the net structure, withoutan exhaustive enumeration of its state space. The techniques wepropose for computing synchronizing sequences exploit the netstructure and lead to viable algorithms that can be applied tolarge scale systems.
