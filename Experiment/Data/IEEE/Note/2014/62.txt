- For large electricity users;  such as smelting plants;  they are subjected to the maximum electric demand constraint. The maximum demand control device is widely adopted to solve the problem;  but it will cause a decline in production output and energy-efficiency. This paper was motivated by improving the multiple production targets (i.e;  the total production output;  the product quality;  and the total electricity cost) of a plant via load scheduling and control. In contrast to the maximum demand control;  the load scheduling and control approach is a beforehand strategy that can optimize the operation. A case study on a magnesia-smelting plant shows that the proposed approach performs better than the maximum demand control technique.
