This paper was motivated by the problem of nonlinear filtering algorithms encountered by the nonlinear systems such as the target tracking problems and inertial navigation. It is well known that the optimal closed-form solution to Bayesian filtering for nonlinear systems is generally unavailable because exact solutions to the multidimensional integral equations in the Bayesian estimation do not exist. The recently developed quadrature Kalman filter uses the Gaussâ€“Hermite numerical integration rule to obtain a suboptimal solution for the integral to calculate exactly the recursive Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we mathematically propose an improved quadrature filter to reduce the computational load of the original filter. This can allow the automatic target tracking systems to response faster and obtain more accurate results. From the simulation analysis, we can find that the proposed method can achieves higher accuracy than the most widely used extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter for nonlinear filtering problems, especially when the initial errors are large. In future research, we will investigate the performance of the filtering algorithm for navigation in our new developed unmanned aerial vehicle and for attitude stabilization and tracking in the Satcom-on-the-move.
