Battery manufacturing is becoming moreand more important due to increasing demand of hybrid and electric vehicles. To achieve a high volume production of high-performance battery packs, improving manufacturing quality is of critical importance. In battery assembly process, multiple inspectionson dimension, stacking, welding, electrics, and leaking, etc., will becarried out to ensure battery quality, and repair stations are typically installed immediately after inspection to correct all the defects. The variation of individual process will not only affect qualityratio at the specific inspection station, but also may propagate andaccumulate along the manufacturing process, which can be viewedthat there exists a quality flow along the line. Such a flow of qualitycharacteristics may include multiple quality features (such as dimension, conductivity, joints, sealing, etc.) and have multiple repair processes. Developing a method to analyze such systems isof importance. In this paper, a quality flow model is presented toevaluate the quality propagation and investigate system-theoreticproperties. Bottleneck identification methods are developed to improve product quality. A case study at a battery assembly line forelectric vehicles is introduced to illustrate the method and its applicability.
