In supervisory control theory, a supervisor restricts the plant behavior in order to fulfill given specifications. A problem for larger industrial applications is that the resulting supervisor is not easily implemented and comprehensiblefor the users. To tackle this problem, an efficient method has recently been introduced to characterize a supervisor by tractablelogic conditions, referred to as guards. This approach has been developed for a specific type of automata with variables called extended finite automata. An extension of this approach to a moregeneral class of models is presented in this paper. Thus, classical supervisory control problems for automata and Petri nets are easilyand efficiently solved, but also generalized based on the suggestedapproach.
