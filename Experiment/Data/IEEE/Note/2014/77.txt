Cell formation and parts scheduling aretwo important correlated processes in a cellular manufacturingsystem; however, the decisions involved in these processes aretypically made individually. Determining how to integrate thesedecisions has become an important issue. This paper proposes aneffective solution to integrate the decisions of cell formation andparts scheduling, while considering intercell moves. To effectivelysolve the model, a Lagrangian relaxation decomposition methodwith heuristic (LRDH) is developed, which provides a lowerbound of the optimal solution. Theoretical analysis and simulationresults demonstrate that the LRDH is an effective approach that can be easily implemented. This approach facilitates productionmanagers to implement an integrated decision with a near optimal solution, and it has been demonstrated to be effective in anelectronic appliance cellular manufacturing enterprise in China.
