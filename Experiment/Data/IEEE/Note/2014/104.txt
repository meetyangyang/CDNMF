Web service composition is an emerging and important area for workflow automation. This work presents a novel Petri net-based divide-and-conquer method to analyze the compatibility of composed Web services under temporal constraints. The proposed method not only checks the temporal violations of a multiple-service composition efficiently by generating the modular timed state graphs of a composition, but also provides the reliable and usable execution paths of participating services to guide users in securing successful service executions. It consists of three phases: 1) modeling the composition of Web services via a mediation net; 2) constructing the modular timed state graph of a composition in a modular way; and 3) verifying the timed compatibility and deriving the usable and reliable execution paths for services. A real-life case is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed concepts and method.
