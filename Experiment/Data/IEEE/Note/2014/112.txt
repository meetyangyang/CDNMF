This paper is motivated by the scarcity of tracking devices for the training of novices in computer-assisted and navigated surgeries. Reliable and low-cost tracking systems are important to ensure easily available surgical training outside operating rooms. The current off-the-shelf tracking systems have been employed in operating rooms for tracking surgical instruments, typically with submillimeter accuracy, but they are highly expensive and require extensive preparation prior to surgery. Hence, the proposed cost-effective tracking system aims to bridge the gap and enable general trainees to learn computer assisted surgery, which is otherwise only available in a limited number of labs or operating rooms.
