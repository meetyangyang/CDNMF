This work introduces the concept of anintegrated production line and facility HVAC system to maximizeenergy savings in a manufacturing environment. Energy savingsopportunities are developed along with the concept of recoverytime for a serial production line. Simulation studies incorporate different ESO strategies for the production operations andchanging set points for the HVAC system utilizing EnergyPlussoftware. These energy strategies use real time information suchas buffer contents, machine speed, etc., to calculate the amount oftime a machine can be turned off without throughput loss. Thismethodology is very useful for implementation in manufacturingfacilities since it uses readily available plant floor data. This paperprovides the framework for coordinating the two systems tomaximize the energy cost without sacrificing throughput on theproduction line.
