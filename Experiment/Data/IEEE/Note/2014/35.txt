Although various APC/R2R control approaches have been proposed for specific conditions, little researchhas been done to deal with unknown changing production/processconditions in the real setting of semiconductor fabrication. Focusing on a realistic problem, this study is the first to developdynamically adjusted proportional-integral R2R controller byconsidering future disturbance prediction to effectively reduceoverlay errors. The proposed DAPI controller has only one keyparameters needed to be determined like exponentially weightedmoving average (EWMA) controllers. The proposed approachwas validated in a leading semiconductor company in Taiwan andhas been implemented on line.
