Automated systems such as sensor networks have begun to play a larger role in various aspects of our daily lives in recent years. With this, the ability to observe and measure the reliability of such networks has become increasingly important. There exist several methods to measure the reliability of the network. One way to measure the reliability of the network is to consider the degree of redundancy of the network. We present a simple, competitive method to compute the degree of redundancy of a sensor network based on a simple reformulation of the problem. However, as with other methods, there are some computational concerns that arise for large problem instances.
