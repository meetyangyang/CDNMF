Owing to its importance in practice,deadlock arouses interest. Various resolution methods havebeen proposed by researchers and practitioners. The recentadvance is to associate various sensors and actuators to certainpredetermined working nodes for the sake of management andcoordination of limited resources among concurrent operations.This uses a supervisory controller to a plant model. Nevertheless,existing approaches suffer from structural complexity due to theirfailure to reduce the sophisticated supervisor structures, whichimpedes their implementation in practice. Without a simplifiedcontrol network, the communication cost among heterogeneousnodes increases while the responsive time decreases. Through theanalysis on the dependency relationship among different inequalities, this paper presents a reduction technique to significantlysimplify the supervisor structures. Without any extra investment,our approach betters a controlled system's performance.
