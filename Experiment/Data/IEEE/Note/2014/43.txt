IaaS has become an important paradigmin cloud computing and there are many commercial offeringssuch as Amazon EC2, IBM Smart Cloud Enterprise, and Microsoft Azure. IaaS providers are facing a big challenge on howto schedule their resources to meet the demand and at the sametime guarantee the QoS promised. We propose a frameworkallowing an IaaS provider to outsource its workloads to externalclouds when its own resources are not sufficient. A SLPSO is usedto effectively schedule inter-cloud resources. This framework ismore practical compared with cloud federation because it doesnot need any business agreement to be reached in advance. Thescheduling approach is able to find the optimal or suboptimalallocation scheme of internal and external resources to maximizethe profit of IaaS providers, and can greatly improve the qualityof scheduling solution.
