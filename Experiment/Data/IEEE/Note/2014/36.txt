- A fast and efficient anticollision algorithm is required in many applications such as warehouse and supply chain management. Since most RFID interrogators are built with a single-chip microprocessor;  whose computation ability or memory is limited. From the implementation point of view;  a feasible algorithm should consider the compromise between complexity and performance. In order to easily implement the anticollision algorithm in a real RFID system;  the proposed algorithm is based on a simple but sufficiently accurate method rather than complex models. The results obtained can be useful for the industry to develop fast and efficient RFID interrogators.
