Since the increasing complexity of industrial processes leads to the wide occurrence of nonlinearities and uncertainties, how to design the robust controller for nonlinear systems with uncertainties is a matter of great significance to control practitioners. In this paper, an optimal learning control approach is employed to handle the robust control problem by using the online policy iteration algorithm. Only a critic neural network needs to be constructed to approximate the cost function. The training of the action network is not required since the closed-form solution is available. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system based on the developed control policy is provided. The validity of the robust control strategy is illustrated through simulation study.
