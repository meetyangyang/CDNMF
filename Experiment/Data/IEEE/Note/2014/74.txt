In modern society, advertising is an important part in brand marketing strategy. The planning and designof an advertising campaign involve several decisions, among whichis advertising budget allocation. It aims to determine the optimaladvertising expenditure among individual brands over a predetermined planning horizon, competing for a limited resource or geographic market segments. However, little work deals with the allocation of a given advertising budget for propagating services overtime. In this study, a method for the optimal advertising budgetallocation over the planning horizon of the advertising campaignfor a financial service is provided. A response model is constructedusing the LS-SVMR. Taking the budgets allocated to every monthin the planning horizon as decision variables, the budget allocation optimization problem is proposed and an improved differential evolution algorithm is then applied to find the optimal solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed advertising budget allocation method is validated by a numerical example.
