In many processes, it is not always possible to associate a sensor with each state due to the cost and thephysical location. In most control applications, not all state variables are measurable. This characteristic can be found in manydiscrete-event systems such as manufacturing systems, microcircuit design, transportation systems, and the food industry. Thevariables in discrete-event systems express events such as the beginning/end of a task, the departure/arrival of a train at a railroad crossing, etc. However, the unknown data can be crucial forthe control system which supervises the process. In particular, theknowledge of the timestamps of these past events allows future actions to be determined. The technique proposed in this paper isbased on a specific calculation of the unknown numbers of eventsby using the known data on a sliding horizon.
