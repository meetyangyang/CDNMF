Motivated by the need to optimize energyefficiency in manufacturing community, this paper considersan energy-optimal scheduling problem for FMSs with sharedresources and flexible part routing. This class of FMSs class canbe encountered nowadays in many realistic manufacturing plantssuch as flowlines, job shops, and material handling systems, etc.Therein, different resources require different productive powers(when resources hold parts) and processing times to perform thesame job; and their idle powers (when resources release parts)are also variant. As such, the considered problem optimizes bothproductive and idle energy consumption, which is often omittedby other energy-efficient scheduling techniques in current literature. A novel and fundamental scheduling method is presentedwhich is based on WTPNs and a newly proposed algorithm calledRG-based DP. Given an FMS with complete information of parttypes, jobs, and resources, our proposed scheduling method isable to generate near energy-optimal schedules within adequatecomputational time. The practicality of the considered problemand the usability of our proposed scheduling method are verifiedusing energy data logged from an industrial stamping system, in which the stamping parts are various types of voice coil motoryokes used in commercial hard disk drive actuators. Beyond theenergy-optimal scheduling application, our proposed schedulingmethod can be also applied to other industrial problems whichinvolve the costs per time unit, including labor management andscheduling, aircraft landing scheduling, project management, andresource rental optimization, etc.
