The general motivation of this paper is themotion automation of a truck and trailer vehicle. Specifically, giventwo arbitrary, dynamic configurations of the articulated vehicle theproblem is to provide an efficient and flexible method to bring theautomated vehicle from the initial configuration to a final desiredconfiguration by means of feedforward control in such a way that:1) control signals are smooth (i.e., truck’s velocity and steeringangle with their derivatives are continuous functions) and 2) theautomated vehicle follows a Cartesian path that can be freely andeasily shaped by adjusting or choosing parameters with clear geometrical meaning. The paper provides a solution by developing andpresenting a new, parameterized, polynomial curve: the -spline.Using this spline or a composition of these splines, a variety ofpath generation problems can be addressed also including nonconventional “on the fly” planning, such as, e.g., a parking maneuverstarting when the articulated vehicle is operating or moving. Withfuture research, it will be possible to efficiently integrate the useof the -spline into a global motion planning framework so asto take into account both obstacle avoidance and technical constraints given by bounds on steering and trailer angles. To this end,the authors make available to colleagues and researchers the detailed, closed-form expressions of the -spline.
