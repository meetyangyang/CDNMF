The whole production line of industrialprocesses is usually composed of multiple subprocesses. The automation system of each subprocess consists of the process control part and the operational optimization system. The challengingissue is how the automation systems can be integrated to realizeoptimal control of the global production indices (i.e., the productquality, yield, cost and profit, etc.). Taking the hematite ore processing as an example, this paper provides the problem descriptionof integrated optimization for the whole plant and proposes an integrated optimization strategy for the automation systems of mineral processing. Since the global production indices, the productionindices, and the operational indices are of multiple time scale, theproposed strategy consists of three layers, namely, the optimization of the targeted values for monthly global production indices,the optimization of the targeted values for daily production indices,and the optimization of the targeted values for the hourly operational indices. Optimization and adaptation, prediction and adjusting are adopted to realize the hierarchical optimization structure of different time scales. The sampling period of months is usedto optimize the targets of global production indices. Taking the targeted global production indices as constraints, the sampling period of days is used to optimize the targets of production indices.Meanwhile, taking the minimization of the error between the actual values and the target of production indices as performance,the operational indices are optimized hourly. Using the automation systems to realize the tracking of these targeted values, onecan ensure that the actual values of the global production indicescan be made as close as possible to their targeted values. This wouldtherefore realize the integrated optimization of the whole production line. The proposed strategy has been applied to a hematite oreprocessing plant and desired results have been achieved.
