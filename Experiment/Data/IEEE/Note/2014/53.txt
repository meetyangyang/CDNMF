 This paper is motivated by the problemof compensating the time-varying delays and data dropouts in networked control systems (NCSs). Overcoming the effects of timevarying delays and data dropouts in NCSs is an important issue,especially in industrial operations where the control signals aretransmitted through the internet. In this paper, a novel model is established to capture the relationship of delays between the consecutive sampling points. The predictive scheme is used to compensatethe effects of the network delays and data dropouts in NCSs. Simultaneously, it is more meaningful from the view of engineering toguarantee that the systems possess strong robust performance except for system stability. In this paper, we not only provide the stability analysis for the considered system but also give a controllerdesign scheme to compensate the disadvantages of the time-varyingdelays and data dropouts such that the NCSs satisfy a performanceindex. The proposed control method is finally used to control aDC-motor through the Intranet, of which the aim is to obtain a desired speed. The method is shown valid and less conservative compared with other existing ones.
