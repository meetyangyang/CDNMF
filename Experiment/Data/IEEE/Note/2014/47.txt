This paper concerns the automatedalignment of the large number of noisy images that must behandled when class averaging is applied in single-particle electronmicroscopy. The new proposed method consists of prealignment,iterative alignment using the CC, artificial image blurring andimage segmentation. The prealignment is obtained by matchingthe center of mass and the principal axis of the images. Thisresults in a SLAM-like distribution of pose with quantifiablecovariance, on which computations can be performed. Next theprealigned images are aligned more accurately through the iterative CC method with image blurring and segmentation. Themost notable improvement is the prealignment step. Although this prealignment inherently results in imperfect alignment becauseof the background noise on the images, the statistical informationof the imperfect alignment can be obtained and is used for theiterative CC at the next step to obtain better alignment at the end.Since the prealignment involves the principal axes of images, thealignment method proposed in this paper targets the alignment ofnon-circular projection images.
