This paper presents a simulator for thecontrol of industrial ball mill grinding plants. It was motivated bythe problem of testing control system. Advanced control system,such as the integrated control system, often has to be installedas an update to the regulatory control system of an operatingplant. Using the proposed simulator, it can reduce the cost andrisk of such on field testing. More specifically, the simulator canbe applied to different phases of a control engineering project:(i) During the phase of control system design, the simulator canbe used for gaining qualitative knowledge of the process. (ii)During the phase of development, the simulator can be used forthe quantitative analysis of the dynamic performance of the localregulatory controllers and the optimal controllers. (iii) Duringthe phase of deployment, the simulator can be used before itsactual deployment for system integration plan test, performancedemonstrate, and operator training. To demonstrate its usage, thispaper provides a case of application of the simulator to the designand test of the optimal setting control of a ball mill grinding plantin a real engineering project.
