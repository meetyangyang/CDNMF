New environmental legislation on emission and fuel efficiency targets increasingly requires good transientengine performance and this in turn means that the previously acceptable static control models obtained from steady-state testingmust be replaced with dynamical models. Although many advanceshave been made in predictive models for internal combustion engines, the engines involve so many complex nonlinear phenomenathat black-box models must be determined by experimental testingof final prototypes. Setting up automotive engine management control systems for any new engine type consequently means that acostly experimental testing process must be undertaken. To obtainsufficiently accurate nonlinear dynamical models in this process, itis essential to properly excite all of the modes of behavior of the dynamics by an appropriately rich choice of test signal. Some physicalprocesses in the engine such as engine knock, however, can physically damage the test engine and test equipment if the exciting signals are too aggressive, and so the signal and engine states must beconstrained within strict limits. The use of transient models alsorequires the recording of fast sampled time histories over long periods which significantly explodes the dimensionality of the testsignal design problem. This paper addresses how the test signalscan be designed in a time efficient way using a new optimality approach to capture the nonlinear dynamics by the system identification in automatic engine testing without exceeding the safe testsignal limits. Many other complex industrial nonlinear dynamicalsystems have similar experimental testing safety constraints andaccuracy requirements and should be able to employ the new optimal test signal technique proposed in the paper.
