In a complex engineering system, the occurrence of faults changes the dynamics of the system, driving the system from the normal mode to faulty modes. In faulty modes, the performance of the system often degrades. It is very important that the system can recover from faulty modes. Since many complex engineering systems are typically event-driven and can be modeled as discrete-event systems, we investigate recoverability in a discrete-event system framework. The results can be used to guide the design of fault-tolerant engineering systems to ensure recoverability.
