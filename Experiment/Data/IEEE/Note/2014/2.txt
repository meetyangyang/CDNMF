Current industrial practice of supervisorycontroller design is based on a separation between informal specification of behavioral requirements by domain experts, and encoding of these requirements in control software by software specialists, leading to code and requirements that are difficult to develop, debug, maintain, and adapt. We propose a supervisory controller design process that instead relies on modeling the behavioral requirements and uncontrolled system, and generating thecontroller by means of supervisory control synthesis.Where supervisory control synthesis provides technology to develop the controller right, we employ simulation-based validationto ensure that the right controller is built. This can be done bymeans of execution of user-defined scenarios, and generation ofgraphs showing the evolution of the model variables as a functionof time. The simulator also supports real-time, interactive, simulation and animation, based on user supplied images of the system inthe standardized Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.The discussed new development process of supervisory controllers has been demonstrated to be highly effective for generation of code, that has been used for real-time control of an actual patient support table of an MRI system. The enormous potential forreduction of development time of new controller functionality isillustrated by means of an actual user modification request case.The new supervisory controller development process is currently under investigation by several high tech industries inEindhoven. A new project has been defined together with severalhigh tech companies, including an innovative software company,to further develop the methods, techniques and tools to a level thatis suited for commercial application.
