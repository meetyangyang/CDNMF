- The global industry trend towards sustainability demands energy optimization as a primary goal. Currently;  industrial multirobot systems are not efficiently programmed as long as effective simulation tools are mostly lacking. In this context;  a detailed model of the production line is proposed;  which can be readily integrated into commercial tools for robot programming. Furthermore;  the impact of practical optimization methods which are readily applicable to existing equipment is quantitatively highlighted. The key aspect of the proposed approach is that both the production rate of each cell and the robot hardware limitations are considered as strict constraints;  so that no significant changes to the plant are required.
