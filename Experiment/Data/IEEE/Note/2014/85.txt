In the academic literature, the commandand control theory of hierarchical control for discrete-event systems is well established for meeting control specifications of safetywith nonblockingness. This paper proposes a new operationaldesign that uses the two-level structure of high-level command andlow-level control, hitherto only a theoretical concept, for onlinetranslation of command to control during runtime hierarchicalcontrol. The design is realized with a two-level control algorithmand a reusable “control technology” for the real discrete-eventsystem at the low level, developed using the fresh theoretical findings in this paper. As the first steps in filling the theory-to-practicegap, the practical advantages of this new operational designinclude facilitating a deeper understanding of control with online causal clarity of command over control, and a significantreduction in offline synthesis complexity with fast online controlcomputation. In laying an algorithmic foundation for online hierarchical control, the proposed design has potential applicationsfor many engineering control problems, where command andcontrol is the inherent mode of runtime operation, or is needed toprovide operational clarity when subjecting the control system tovalidation tests by simulation and observation. Problems includethe design of logical command and control systems for supervisingsmart grids, traffic light systems and mass rapid transit networks,where the manager in the central command center may issuehigh-level commands to the operators to control the low-levelphysical system.
