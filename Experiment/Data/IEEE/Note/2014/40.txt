A cluster tool consists of several processing chambers, typically six or more, and a single waferhandling robot. It has complex robot task scheduling issues because of its configuration. Cluster tools use simple scheduling rulessuch as the backward and swap sequences that are developed forprocessing identical wafers. Recent fabs increasingly use only twoor three process steps for processing wafers of an identical typewhile there are six to eight chambers in a tool. Therefore, theytend to process several different wafer types concurrently in a toolin order to better utilize the chambers. Since tools mostly use thesimple backward or swap sequence, we wish to know whether theyare still optimal for concurrent processing. We present conditionson process times, robot task times, and the number of wafers produced in a cycle for which the backward and swap sequencesare still optimal. The conditions also suggest how many wafers ofeach type in a cycle should be produced to maximize the utilizationof a tool. When the conditions are not met, we develop an efficientMIP model based on the backward and swap sequences. With thisMIP, most practical problems can be solved instantaneously ascompared to the existing methods.
