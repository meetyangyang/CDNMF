The report presents a relatively simple algorithm for calculating the compliances (or flexibilities) of symmetric notch flexure hinges. Unlike the comprehensive approachto analytically evaluating compliances, which is entirely an integral one, our methodology only needs integration for a minimumcompliance set of a quarter flexure, the compliances of the full symmetric flexure being calculated subsequently by simpler linear algebraic operations. The new right circularly corner-filleted parabolic flexure design is introduced, whose analytical-model predictions are validated experimentally and numerically.
