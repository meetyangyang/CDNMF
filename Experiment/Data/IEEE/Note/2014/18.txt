HVAC systems work under time-varyingweather and cooling load, and it is therefore difficult to detectfaults. In addition, the various devices of HVAC systems requirethe detection method simple and robust so that it has good replicability and scalability. A gray-box model-based and data-drivenmethod is developed in this paper. It is a novel combinationof SPC, Kalman filter, and system analysis. By measuring andanalyzing variations of model parameters, a fault can be detectedwhen it causes these parameters to deviate from their normalranges. The method detects both sudden and gradual faults with high detection rate and low false alarm rate. It also detects effectsof faults in one subsystem on another to help detect and confirmdevice faults.
