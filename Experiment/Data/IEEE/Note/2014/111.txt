Understanding the usage pattern and the evolution mechanism can help better recommend services and their compositions to developers. Our hypotheses are: 1) historical information carries the usage patterns and evolution mechanism of the ecosystem and 2) services are not isolated but collaborative with each other, therefore, we should not only concern about individual services but also their correlations. Based on these hypotheses, our network prediction-based approach constructs the network series model based on historical information, and transform the evolution prediction into a network prediction problem. Furthermore, we predict the future behavior of the network based on link prediction. Based on the predicted network, we recommend potential compositions, services, and service chains that are evolution-aware and better reflect the up-to-date trend in the ecosystem.
