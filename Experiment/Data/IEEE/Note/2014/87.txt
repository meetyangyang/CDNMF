Since the 1990s, fault detection and diagnosis of discrete-event systems have been widely studied. The evolution of the studied systems which become increasingly complex requires new and adapted diagnostic methods. Moreover, the majority of works do not take into account the temporal evolution through the dynamics of the failure. This paper proposes a methodology for building automatic diagnosers of timed discrete-event systems. Our framework can be applied efficiently for diagnosis of large manufactured systems. Indeed, building by hand diagnosers for such systems is difficult and error-prone. We use a modular modeling and consider only permanent fault models for actuators and sensors and only the plant model is a timed automaton. These restrictions limit the application domain of our method, but our solution proposes a general model capturing the independent and interactive behaviors of these modules by modeling them as communicating timed automata using the model-checking tool Uppaal, which enables us to perform formal verification of the built diagnoser. The generation of the diagnoser is made offline and is composed of two steps. The first step consists of building a part of the product of the different modules and the second step consists of determining the obtained product. The algorithm is described and implemented in a tool.
