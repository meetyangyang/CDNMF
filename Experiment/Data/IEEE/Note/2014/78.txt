Manufacturing facility layouts are typically designed with the singular focus of promoting minimumdistance material flows, as material handling costs increase withtravel distance. However, the square footage required by a layoutalso contributes to manufacturing costs, as is especially true incleanroom environments typically found in semiconductor manufacturing. This paper proposes a methodology for determining aset of Pareto optimal solutions, highlighting the tradeoff betweenminimizing material flow cost versus facility size. We demonstratethis approach on a commonly used layout configuration, where tworows of machines are separated by an aisle. Despite the straightforward problem description, determining optimal solutions to thisproblem is challenging. Our approach is shown to work efficientlyon problems of realistic size and provide implementable machinelayouts.
