Because of short product lifecycles, cycletime reduction and on-time delivery are crucial in high-tech industries such as the TFT-LCD and semiconductor manufacturing. Toaddress these needs in real settings, a novel multiobjective hybridgenetic algorithm (MO-HGA) was developed, hybridizing with avariable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm as a local searchand TOPSIS technique to select the best compromised solution forthe TFT-LCD module assembly scheduling problem. Experimentshave shown practical viability of this approach. Future studies canbe done to extend the developed solution to other high-tech manufacturing industries.
