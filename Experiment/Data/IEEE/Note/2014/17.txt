Water resource optimal allocation isan important decision making activity in water resource management systems. This paper sets up a water resource optimalallocation model based on multiagent modeling technology, wheredifferent optimal objectives are abstracted into various propertiesof agents, and a new multiagent Q-learning approach is proposedto deal with the optimal allocation problem in water resourcemanagement system. The proposed approach can be used in practical water resource management systems, with any feasible datafrom the statistical agencies of government and companies. Theexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiencyof the agent-based allocation model and the proposed approachbased on the novel multiagent Q-learning algorithm.
