Magnetostrictive actuators featuring high energy densities, large strokes and fast responses appear poised to play an increasingly important role in fields of requiring micro positioning. However, such actuators invariably exhibit hysteresis nonlinearities that could cause oscillations and error in the micro positioning tasks. This study presents a methodology to cancel the hysteresis effect in an open-loop manner in putting, in cascade, a feedforward compensator in a magnetostrictive actuator. Such a hysteresis compensator is attained through application of an inverse multiplicative technique formulated on the basis of the Preisach model and laboratory-measured hysteresis properties of the magnetostrictive actuator. The effectiveness of the inverse compensator for mitigating hysteresis nonlinearities is demonstrated through hardware-in-the-loop laboratory measurements of a magnetostrictive actuator. Experimental results suggest that the inverse method could provide hysteresis compensation in a simple and effective manner. The future work will fuse this feedforward compensator with robust adaptive control techniques to further enhance the robustness of the system.
