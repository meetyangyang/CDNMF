With the increasing requirement fromindustrial processes such as chemical processes, electrolysis andphysical processes, it is important to regulate the output of systemsto satisfy a desired objective. This paper addresses the problemof RMPC with saturations and packet dropouts, in which theexpectations of random packet dropouts are time-varying. Suchphenomena can be widely observed in networked control systems.By means of the proposed RMPC, the output of flotation processescan be operated to a specific goal. Future research topics include using parameter-dependent techniques to reduce the conservativeness and considering more practical phenomena to reflectmore realistic factors.
