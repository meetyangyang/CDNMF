This paper was motivated by the problemof inspecting for defective solder joints in linear, automated production line for hard disk drive parts. The size and placement of thepart in the tool presented a challenge to capturing a full view of theobject under inspection. Existing approaches manipulate parts ofthe image under different conditions. This paper suggests a methodthat associates the likelihood of a measured feature of the image tothe quality of the solder joint produced. In this paper, we characterized the features mathematically and established a probabilisticrelationship between the features and the quality of the solder joint.We then showed how the relationship can be used in real-time determination of the quality of a solder joint presented to the inspection system. We showed that the system achieved reasonable accuracy when applied to production.
