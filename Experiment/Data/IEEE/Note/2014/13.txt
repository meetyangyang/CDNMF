Simultaneous impacts are a common occurrence in manufacturing and robotic applications. Simulationbased techniques predicting the motion of a mechanical systemsubject to simultaneous impacts often use numerical routines thatmake algorithmic assumptions about impact in order to make thesimulation more tractable. Such assumptions have the potential tosignificantly influence the simulation outcome and may even invalidate results. This paper provides tools for simulating simultaneousimpacts, verifying a simulation that deals with simultaneous impacts, and designing a system so that the simulation will be lessdynamically sensitive to indeterminacy in simultaneous impact.
