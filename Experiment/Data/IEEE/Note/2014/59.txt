In life sciences, the need for advanced automation methods to sample preparation and analysis at the microscale has increased at a steady pace together with microfluidicand lab-on-a-chip applications. Biological research especially requires new tools for cell micromanipulations since, to date, this ismostly achieved by manual handling by human operators. This hasled to low manipulation efficiency and poor reproducibility. In suchcontext, we developed a magnetic system for lab-on-a-chip applications that can be used for wirelessly manipulating a magneticmicrorobot in a microfluidic environment. In this paper, we testits use as both a teleoperated and autonomous tool for navigatingmicrorobots in a microfluidic environment with different levels ofuser interaction. The features of the magnetic system, such as itsintrinsic simplicity, enable a reliable, natural and smooth motionof the microrobot through both control architectures. This leads tohigh performance and repeatability in automated tasks, as well asto exceptional intuitiveness in user-controlled tasks, as proven bythe reported fast learning curve. We believe that this particular aspect will facilitate the adoption of this kind of magnetic navigationsystems for a plethora of applications.
