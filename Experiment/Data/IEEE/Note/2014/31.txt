€“The problem that motivated this paperis that of triangulating the position of a radio transmitter on abattlefield. It is important to determine enemy positions, perhaps from the emissions of a communication device, to planoffensive, and perhaps defensive actions. Triangulation is alsoimportant to rescue operations, for example, locating downedaircraft and stranded ships. We employ several methodologiesin this study, including simulation, numerical integration, andcomplete enumeration but synthesize our primary methodologyusing a surrogate measure of detection effectiveness and dynamicprogramming to solve a specially structured, constrained shortestpath problem. Our method is well suited for battlefield application and our research continues to enhance our model, takinginto consideration obstructions that might interfere with radiotransmissions as well as uncertainty.
