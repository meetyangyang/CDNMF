The research activities described in this paper have been carried out to tackle a novel problem in Robotics. Since different robots have different shapes (in terms of covers) and since—even narrowing the analysis to a single robot—different body parts of the same robot have different shapes, how can we automate the procedure of designing and deploying sensitive skin for robots? Sensitive skin for robots is a fundamental means for achieving a high degree of physical human-robot interaction in real-world scenarios. The design of sensitive skin for robots is difficult: modular, scalable and dependable solutions (both at the hardware and software levels) are needed, which are in contrast with the need of deploying the actual sensitive skin on a variety of surfaces. In this paper, we formally characterize the robot skin design process as a geometric placement problem, in an effort to obtain a tradeoff between skin modularity and skin customization for specific robot surfaces.
