Hospitals usually consider ORs as themost critical resources and are used to manage patients andhuman resources to avoid OR idle time. As surgeons are becominganother critical resource, providing surgeons with reliable surgerystarting times becomes more and more important. Unfortunately,uncertainties of surgery durations make the problem of settingreliable surgery starting times challenging. We propose an efficientalgorithm for dynamic surgery assignment in a multi-OR systemby taking into account given surgeon arrival times while bestbalancing surgeon waiting time and OR idle and overtime. Theproposed approach significantly outperforms benchmark strategies. Various sensitivity analyses provide valuable managerialinsights to hospital decision makers.
