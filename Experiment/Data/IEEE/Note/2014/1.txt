In today’s industry, the control functionsare implemented to a great extent manually by designing a candidate and verifying it towards different properties to ensure that thecontrol function is satisfactory. Designing a control function manually makes it a tedious, error-prone and time consuming process.Another way is to do this process automatically, referred to as thesynthesis method. In the synthesis method, the designers model thesystem’s behavior and the desired properties and feed them to analgorithm that can automatically generate the control function. Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) provides a powerful frameworkfor automatically synthesizing safe and flexible control functions,referred to as supervisors, that restrict the system only when it necessary. For large-scale systems, synthesis typically suffers of fromthe state space explosion problem, that is the required memoryto represent the states of the system is more than the availablememory. To handle real-time systems, in this paper, we also incorporate time in the theory and show how the supervisor can be efficiently computed for large-scale systems.
