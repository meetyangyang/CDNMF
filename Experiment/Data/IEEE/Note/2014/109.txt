—With advances in information and sensing technologies, the past decade has witnessed an increasingly growing research interest on various aspects of degradation model-based reliability estimation. In Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 209–212, Jan. 2012, Sun et al., an approach to dynamically extract maintenance threshold is presented for maintenance scheduling. However, the formulation for reliability estimation by a modified two-stage degradation modeling approach presented in the above paper is just an asymptotic solution in long-time scale. The main contribution of this paper is that we provide the exact and explicit formulation for reliability estimation, which accounts for the impact of random effect parameter on reliability estimation. This is necessary, in general, because the approximation on reliability estimation will affect the timeliness of maintenance decision. Therefore, the results in this paper are useful for engineers and developers to implement dynamic threshold-based maintenance in the above paper.
