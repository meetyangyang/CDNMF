This work presents a robust environmental sound recognition system for home automation. Specific home automation services, such as security surveillance, safety monitoring, object handling, or appliance control, can be activated via computers based on identified sound classes. This study mathematically characterizes the input signal and converts it into a numeric audio feature. Subsequently, inappropriate audio features that may degrade system performance are filtered out by statistical methods. In the final stage, an estimator is used for classifying audio features.
