For field biologists, automation is still arecent concept in data acquisition and analysis. The two proposedalgorithms enable automatic data analysis for crowd sourcedvideos, which often contain rich information about large habitatsacross multiple bird species. In fact, the bottleneck in utilizingthese big video data is the time it takes to analyze them. Sincecrowd sourced videos are often taken by untrained amateurs withunknown camera motion and parameters. The videos are oftentaken at different and challenging lighting conditions becausebirds are often active at twilight time. Emphasizing on robustnessand sensitivity instead of selectivity, our algorithm design takesthe aforementioned factors into account and only utilizes motioninformation in the detection process to facilitate wide application.
