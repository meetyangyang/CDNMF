Fixtures are widely used in modern manufacturing, which usually requires wide range of workpiece locating accuracy. We are motivated by the fact that existing linear and nonlinear models are generally segregated and only applicable efficiently to certain locating schemes while nonlinear models are still largely under-explored. Instead of proposing a one-size-fits-all method, this paper presented three interlinked models in the distance function framework. They consider different curvature effects and nonlinear effects in workpiece-locator interaction, and the more complex the model, the more accuracy the sensitivity equations provide. The developed models can find many applications in locating scheme evaluation, fixture fault diagnosis, and tolerance setting and analysis. The users can choose a proper model according to the specific tasks by using numerical simulations and experiments.
