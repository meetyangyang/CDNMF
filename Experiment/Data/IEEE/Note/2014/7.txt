The motivation of the present work istwofold. First, we propose a novel freeway system model in aFOHPN framework, in order to combine both the time-drivendynamics, considering the standard traffic fundamental diagram,and the event-driven dynamics, by modeling accidents, and recovery procedures. Second, we suggest an online optimal controlcoordination of speed limits with the objective of maximizing theflow density. The obtained model and control strategies can beused on line, when the traffic is congested, to predict the futurestate and to manage the system by variable speed limits control.Hence, based on the knowledge of the system state and the information about the occurrence of unpredictable events, the modelcan enable the decision makers to evaluate decisions such as theapplication of suitable recovery strategies after an accident or thechoice of optimal speed limits in congested situations. Future research aims to investigate larger simulation campaigns describingmore complex real systems in order to refine the model and thecontrol schemes.
