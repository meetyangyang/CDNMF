This paper was motivated by the practicalproblem of enabling a traditional energy-saving (ES) system toknow what activities are being undertaken in a multi-resident environment. This problem is important for industrial practitionersto improve product readiness for home automation related applications since it helps us put users in the center of an automationprocess for providing more attentive services. Existing approachesfocused more on detecting locations or presence of a single resident to achieve simple yet less human-centric energy saving. Moreover, they often ignored the relationship between usersâ€™ ongoingactivities and the associated energy consumption, which may limit other potentials for energy saving and cannot scale to multiusersolutions. To address these issues, the authors proposed a new approach to recognize multi-resident activities and to analyze variousenergy consumption information associated with the activities. Theapproach can be integrated into a home gateway to change the operating modes of those appliances which are not or less related tothe undertaken activities, thus achieving energy saving without interfering with users. The approach therefore can improve energyefficiency and the quality of ES services, and both are importantfactors for real-life scenarios. Preliminary evaluations suggest thatthe approach is feasible and can achieve energy saving by about30%. However, since we care more about what activities are undertaken rather than who undertakes the activities (i.e., ignoring dataassociation), this may lead to the limitation of non-personalizableES services, but the limitation can be mitigated by incorporatinguser identification techniques such as RFIDs, face recognition, etc.In future research, experiments in real and more houses will beconducted for more realistic evaluations. In addition to the application in a smart home, we can extend the approach to smart office,hospital, and other context-aware applications.
