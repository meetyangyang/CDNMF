To be competitive in the market place, companies must be prudent in use of their resources. This paper considers a parallel scheduling environment where choosing in-house machines or subcontractors, as resources, to perform the jobs on time is the main objective. The jobs to be performed have the same processing time or nearly equal processing times. The problem is formulated as integer programming optimization. Efficient dynamic programming procedure is presented for a special case. Transformation of the general case and several realistic problems to MCKP is provided that allows available algorithms to solve the problems.
