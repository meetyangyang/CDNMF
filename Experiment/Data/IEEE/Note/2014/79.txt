This paper was motivated by the problemof fault detection of chemical process. Most chemical processesare nonlinear processes. Especially in the multiple-mode process,nonlinear is more significant, making the process more difficult tomonitor. In this paper, we modify the receptor density algorithm(MRDA) and combine it with support vector data description(SVDD) and LL algorithm to monitor nonlinear multiple operation modes chemical processes. In LL-SVDD-MRDA, LL isintroduced to solve multiple operation modes, SVDD is adopted toconstruct one-dimensional distance statistics to reflect the changein high-dimensional data and MRDA is used for nonlinear datamonitoring. Our simulation demonstrates that LL-SVDD-MRDAis a highly competitive method for handling nonlinear multipleoperation modes chemical processes monitoring.
