This paper is motivated by our collaboration with the perinatal network in Hauts-de-Seine, Paris, France. Itis a network of maternity facilities of different types where at mostthree levels of services (obstetric, neonatal, and neonatal intensivecare) are provided. All facilities provide the lowest level of care: obstetric service. The maternity facilities differ according to the levelof service provided. Network shows a nested hierarchical propertywhere a higher level facility provides all services provided by alower level facility. Each hospital has a limited number of staffedbeds for each service. As the demographic changes, the perinatalnetwork is facing the problem of relocating its perinatal servicesand adjusting its capacities to match the changing demand. Themathematical models of this paper take into account different options such as opening/closing a service unit, capacity expansion,downsizing, and transfer. The models are used to help decisionmakers sorting these decisions to minimize the overall cost of thenetwork without degrading the service level.
