This paper was motivated by the problem of allocating time and equipment resources efficiently in a flexible assembly line to improve its performance. Among the different methods to solve this problem;  heuristic search techniques are becoming more popular. Current work in literature have proposed a heuristic search algorithm to solve this problem. However;  there is ambiguity in the model. This paper aims to clarify the ambiguity in the proposed flexible assembly line model;  as well as applying a different heuristic search algorithm for comparison purposes. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can solve the problem effectively.
