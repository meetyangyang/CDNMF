- The accurate path tracking must be guaranteed especially when trajectories are planned in the operational space. Unfortunately;  path tracking worsens every time system limits are exceeded. The trajectory generator proposed in this paper is specifically designed for non-redundant manipulators and it is equipped with a scaling system that automatically modifies the speed of the end effector in order to guarantee an accurate path tracking. Several kinematic constraints are handled at the same time. Joint velocities are kept below the manufacturer's limits;  while joint accelerations are bounded in order to achieve smooth movements. The system is also able to constrain the kinematics of the end effector. For example;  in order to reduce the mechanical stress on the payload and to avoid the excitation of elastic modes;  additional bounds on the velocities and accelerations of the end effector are considered and managed. The planner can also be used to generate minimum-time constrained trajectories in real-time. To this purpose;  further constraints on the longitudinal velocities and accelerations have been introduced. Differently from alternative approaches;  the proposed planning scheme does not require any interaction with the controller. This is an advantage;  since controllers of industrial manipulators are typically not accessible or modifiable;  while;  in turn;  proprietary trajectory planners can normally be replaced with ad-hoc implementations. The scaling system can be easily expanded in order to handle additional constraints. The trajectory smoothness;  for example;  can be improved by managing the jerk bounds;  so that the ongoing research activity is currently focused on that target. In the same way;  it could also be possible to handle some dynamic constraints;  but this would impose the introduction of mutual interactions between the scaling system and the central control unit.
