Fault diagnosis is a very important problem in several domains of applications, such as manufacturing, telecommunication,electronics, and so on, since after the occurrence of a fault the system usually deviates from its nominal behavior and appropriate actions of recoveryshould be performed. As a consequence, this problem has been extensivelystudied in the past years both in the case of time-driven and discrete-eventsystems, and several approaches have been proposed. A problem strictlyrelated to fault diagnosis is diagnosability. Solving a problem of diagnosability is equivalent to determine if a system is diagnosable with respect toa given fault, i.e., to determine if, once the fault has occurred, the systemcan detect its occurrence after a finite observation of the system evolution.Obviously, diagnosability is an essential property that must hold if a diagnosis approach is to be applied in real life applications. This paper isdevoted to diagnosability analysis and a procedure based on labeled Petrinets is proposed.
