The resolution of deadlocks in flexiblemanufacturing systems (FMSs) is an important issue since theymay lead to catastrophic results in highly automated productionsystems. Based on Petri nets, a deadlock prevention approachalways aims to design a controller to ensure that deadlocks neveroccur. Behavioral permissiveness is an important criterion in evaluating the performance of a supervisor. A maximally permissivesupervisor can generally lead to high utilization of resources andproductivity of a system. However, if the legal reachability spaceof a net model is nonconvex, it cannot be optimally controlled bythe conjunctions of linear constraints. In this case, this researchdevelops maximally permissive supervisory control by enforcingdisjunctive constraints whose number is minimized. The proposedmethod is applicable to all FMS-oriented Petri net models proposed in the literature.
