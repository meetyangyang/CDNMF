FMSs are used widely in discrete part manufacturing. Recently, the authors developed P-ACD with which a formal model of a real-life industrial FMS can be built. There are three key deliverables in this paper: an FMS simulator executing the P-ACD model of the FMS, P-ACD models of a real-life FMS, and an incremental modeling procedure for building a P-ACD model of the FMS. Thus, as a practitioner, you may: 1) use the FMS simulator posted in the authorsâ€™ URL as a dedicated simulator for your FMS, if the configuration of your FMS is similar to that described in this paper; 2) modify the P-ACD models and develop your own FMS simulator (if the configuration of your FMS differs significantly from that described in this paper); and/or (3) follow the incremental P-ACD modeling procedure given in Section IV in building of a P-ACD model for your FMS. A practical limitation of the P-ACD model of an FMS is that it does not model the AGV network in the FMS.
