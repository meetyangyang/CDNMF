This paper is motivated by an ID method to examine how to novelly represent defective objects and repeated patterns in fabric images. We decompose a fabric image into two components: cartoon structure as defective objects and texture structure as repeated patterns. The ID is optimized by the largest correlation between a given defect-free fabric image and the texture structure of a testing image. Its merit is requiring only one defect-free image to optimize the inspection. The resulting cartoon structure is identified for inspection and visualization. An intensive performance evaluation is conducted on dot-, star-, and box-patterned fabric images and the detection accuracies range from 94.9% 99.6%. This research is beneficial to the practitioners for quality control in textile, ceramics, tile, wallpaper, printed circuit board, and aircraft window industries.
