In todayâ€™s world of large systems and energy shortages, the need for energy efficiency in individual machines is complemented by the need for energy awareness in theuse of the complete system. One important aspect of this is forproper scheduling of tasks to minimize the energy consumption incarrying out a program of tasks over a system of machines. Ourwork is to find an energy-aware schedule for a given system thatalso satisfies the precedence constraints between tasks to be performed by the system. We propose three different algorithms forenergy-aware scheduling and indicate their strengths and limitations. We show that the energy-aware scheduling problem is a generalization of the minimum makespan scheduling problem. Theassumptions made by us in this paper are close to practical settings, as we consider both the power required for task execution aswell as the power dissipation of machines when idle. Our model isgeneric and can describe many distributed systems from differentdomains. We have validated our algorithms with simulations ofsystems with different numbers of machines, with some standardprogram graphs. Our results support the intuition that there canbe energy-minimal schedules that are not time-minimal, and givescope for further work on energy-time trade-offs.
