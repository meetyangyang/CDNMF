- Manipulations of cells and other microparticles represent an essential process for most cell-based bioengineering applications;  such as cytopathology;  cell sociology;  and cytotaxonomy. Cell transportation;  which is treated as a typical cell manipulation task;  has recently received considerable attention because of its wide applications. This paper presents a novel approach to applying RRT-based path planner to cell transportation with a robot-aided optical manipulation system. The research outcome provides a unique solution to achieving cell transportation automatically and efficiently.
