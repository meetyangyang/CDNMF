A tag estimate method presented here iscapable of precisely estimating the number of tags in resolvingmultiple-tag access using dynamic frame length ALOHA. Theoptimal frame length for obtaining the maximum radio channelefficiency is derived. Performance measures including tag estimateerror and total read time show that our proposed anticollisionalgorithm is superior in comparison to previously publishedwork. Since the frame length update mechanism including tagestimate method and the setting of frame length is not specified incurrent RFID standards such as ISO 18000¨C6 and ISO 14443¨C3,our proposed anticollision algorithm can be useful for engineersto implement the dynamic frame length ALOHA algorithm ina real RFID system. Also, using our method can achieve uplinkthroughput close to the theoretical maximum value 0.368 of theframed ALOHA algorithm.
