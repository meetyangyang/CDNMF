This paper is motivated by the study of aregularity feature for finding common properties in patterned textures. In general, regularity analysis of patterned textures involvestwo issues: the spatial relationship between intensity values and therepeat distance of a repetitive unit. These issues can also be definedas the periodicity of a patterned texture. However, the traditionalperiodicity is not effective for developing a patterned texture inspection algorithm. In this paper, a new measure for the regularityof patterned textures is designed for defect detection. It is based onthe idea of applying the periodicity as a new principle for patternedtexture inspection. A break in periodicity is considered to be a defect in patterned texture inspection. This concept has been appliedto the development of a new method called the RB method. The regular band is defined by a moving average and standard deviationof the pixel intensity. It is specialized for defects which have differential intensity changes compared with the pattern on a repetitive unit of patterned texture. The RB method has been found veryeffective for defect detection of patterned fabric. In a comprehensive evaluation, the detection success rate of the RB approach hasreached 99.4% in a total of 166 defective and defect-free imagestaken from three patterned fabrics. In this paper, the techniquesand detection results of the RB method as well as comparisons withother methods are given. The computational time for processing animage of size 256 256 is only 140 ms using the C programminglanguage. This new approach for automated patterned texture inspection is believed to be useful for quality control. It will also makecontributions not only to practitioners in the textile industry, butalso in other industries like wallpaper and ceramics.
