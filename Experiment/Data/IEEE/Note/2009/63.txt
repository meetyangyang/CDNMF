The advertiser-supported web site is oneof the successful business models in the emerging web landscape.When an Internet user enters a keyword (i.e., a search phrase)into a search engine, the user gets back a page with results, containing the links most relevant to the query and also sponsoredlinks, (also called paid advertisement links). When a sponsored linkis clicked, the user is directed to the corresponding advertiser’sweb page. The advertiser pays the search engine in some appropriate manner for sending the user to its web page. Against everysearch performed by any user on any keyword, the search enginefaces the problem of matching a set of advertisers to the sponsored slots. In addition, the search engine also needs to decide on aprice to be charged to each advertiser. Due to increasing demandsfor Internet advertising space, most search engines currently useauction mechanisms for this purpose. These are called sponsoredsearch auctions. A significant percentage of the revenue of Internetgiants such as Google, Yahoo!, MSN, etc., comes from sponsoredsearch auctions. In this paper, we study two auction mechanisms,GSP and VCG, which are quite popular in the sponsored auctioncontext, and pursue the objective of designing a mechanism thatis superior to these two mechanisms. In particular, we propose anew mechanism which we call the OPT mechanism. This mechanism maximizes the search engine’s expected revenue subject toachieving Bayesian incentive compatibility and individual rationality. Bayesian incentive compatibility guarantees that it is optimal for each advertiser to bid his/her true value provided that allother agents also bid their respective true values. Individual rationality ensures that the agents participate voluntarily in the auctionsince they are assured of gaining a non-negative payoff by doing so.
