Abstractâ€”The distribution of a limited rate of high-pressure gas to gaslifted wells, while respecting injection bounds and activation precedenceconstraints, consists of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem.This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear formulation obtained by piecewise-linearizing the nonlinear functions, thereby allowing the use of integer programming algorithms. Valid inequalities for the convex hull offeasible solutions are derived from knapsack covers, for which exact andapproximate lifting procedures yield stronger inequalities. Numerical results show that these cover-based cuts reduce the number of nodes exploredin a branch-and-bound search.
