This research relies on a property of theimmune system in an HIV model. The property is that excitementof a key component in the immune system depends on the infection dynamic states, which correspond to HIV infected cells anduninfected cells. Interestingly, these two states can be measured byclinical methods and, moreover, they are directly affected by antiretroviral drugs, which are used in HAART therapy. Therefore,we propose a control method of drug scheduling in order that theresponse of immune system is “enhanced.” The method is based onthe comprehension of the immune boosting mechanism, and alsocan be applied to different biological systems, which describe disease dynamics with drug input. Consequently, this paper providesguidelines for drug scheduling to strengthen the immune system ofan infected patient.
