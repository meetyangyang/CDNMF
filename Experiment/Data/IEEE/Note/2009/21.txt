In this paper, we present a swimming microrobot which is designed to be small enough to be injected intoa human body to perform controlled drug delivery. In order tosafely inject microrobot into human bodies, the diameter of themicrorobot needs to be or smaller than 0.8 mm, which makes theReynolds number (i.e., the ratio of inertial force to viscous force)very low. In such a low Re environment, traditional propulsivemethods, such as fish-like actuators, scallops and rigid oars whichdepend on reciprocal motions, cannot work efficiently or cannotfunction at all due to their underlying inertial forces propulsionmechanism. Inspired by the bacteria in nature, our design has theunique feature of integrating a spiral-type head and an elastic flagellum-like tail, which enables the microrobot move freely in a lowRe environment. Driven by external magnetic field, the microrobotcan be operated wirelessly. In the case of drug delivery, the elastictail not only serves as a drug reservoir, but also generates propulsive force when proper driving torque is provided and its deformation is triggered. Therefore, the energy efficiency of the system isimproved compared with other rigid-body microrobots carrying asphere drug payload
