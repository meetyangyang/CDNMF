The motivation of the present work is toprovide a generic, simple and accurate model, able to integratethe material, financial and information flows description, for useby decision makers in SC management at the operational level. Inparticular, this paper proposes a model based on the first-order hybrid Petri net model formalism that provides SC designers with important key features. First, the model exhibits good computationalefficiency and easy implementation in engineering software packages. Second, some SC design parameters, such as supplier andmanufacturer production rates, are real continuous variables andcan be determined by polynomial complexity optimization of suitable performance indices. Third, based on knowledge of the systemstate and information on the occurrence of typical operational unpredictable events (e.g., facility blockings and goods demands), themodel enables the decision makers to update some operational design parameters in a closed-loop strategy. Future research aimsto investigate on the decisional structure of the model in order tospecify a decision support system based on the presented modelingframework.
