This work is motivated by the need to improve the viewing comfort of image sequences by enhancing thecontrast, and on the other hand, maintain the mean intensity suchthat a perception of the environment lighting condition can be conveyed effectively to the viewer. The developed technique may wellbe applied in surveillance and inspection tasks deployed, for example, on a mobile robot equipped with a low cost black-and-whitecamera. Since the current work is developed for gray-level images,future research will be directed towards application of this methodto color images
