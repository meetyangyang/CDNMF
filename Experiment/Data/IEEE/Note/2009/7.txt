Recently, RFID has emerged as apromising technology that can strengthen object recognitionfunctionalities. This paper introduces a novel method of objectrecognition based on RFID technology. The 3-D RFID systemproposed in this study not only helps to identify the existence of anobject, but also to estimate its position and orientation. Therefore,the proposed technology considerably reduces dependence onother sensors such as vision typically used for recognizing objects.In this paper, the sensing characteristics of the 3-D RFID systemare verified, and the algorithms for detecting the position andorientation of an object using the system are discussed.
