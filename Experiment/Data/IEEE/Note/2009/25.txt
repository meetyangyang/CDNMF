We describe a system minimizing the risksassociated with the delivery of respiratory depressants to spontaneouslybreathing patients during medical procedures. In this setting, severalfactors can contribute to the occurrence of patient injuries: overdosingleading to profound respiratory depression, especially in the nonsteadystate (bolus administration); inadequate monitoring of physiologicalparameters; delayed or inadequate resuscitation. We propose to monitorthe respiratory gases (O CO  as effective indicators of the patientâ€™sventilatory state and to automatically titrate drug delivery based on thisinformation. We tested the performance of the control system in a software environment with a comprehensive mathematical model of humanmetabolism and cardiorespiratory regulation. Using a PtcCO setpointof 50 mmHg, the system delivered drug concentrations in the acceptedtherapeutic range for analgesia and prevented the occurrence of severe(transient and steady-state) respiratory depression, coping with interindividual variability. Since the drugs and the hardware necessary for theproposed system are commercially available, developing a medical devicefor the automatic delivery of sedatives/analgesics would be relatively inexpensive. In our opinion, the safety of monitored anesthesia care, especiallywhen performed by non-anesthesiologists, would be profoundly enhanced.Future research will be directed towards the design of an algorithm forrobust detection of sensor malfunction and the clinical evaluation of thedevice.
