An automated identification system,which would carry on the identification code of a specified paperor board reel throughout its life cycle, is needed in the paperindustry. Nowadays when barcode identification systems are usedthe identity of the reels disappear when the wrapping of the reeland at the same time the barcode are removed. The RFID tag,however, would be attached to the paper reel core and thereby theidentification code of the reel is restored throughout its life cycle.RFID systems would benefit the paper industry by enhancingthe supply chain visibility and providing a more automatedidentification system than barcode identification. In the future,paper reels will be identified with clamp truck-integrated readerunits which, on the other hand, enables adding more real-timeinformation about the locations of the paper reels to informationdatabases but also sets challenges for paper reel tag performanceand integration of RFID reader units and reader antennas topaper handling machinery. This paper concentrates on passiveUHF RFID systems and their application to the paper industry.Challenges and benefits of RFID systems in the specific applicationenvironment of the paper industry are presented and discussed.
