Increased emphasis on container inspection at ports-of-entry prompted researchers to investigate methodologies that help practitioners in operating such inspection systems in order to reduce both the risk of accepting “undesired containers” as well as the cost of inspection. The threshold levels ofthe sensors can be adjusted by changing, for example, the powerlevel of the X-ray machine or the count level of the sensors in orderto make appropriate decisions. This paper provides methodologies for determining the optimum threshold levels of sensors andorder of inspection that minimize the overall cost of the system.An approach for obtaining these values under budget and risk constraints is also included in this paper.
