This research is motivated by the needto automate the electrophoresis mediated gene therapy, which isan active research area for drug delivery. The practicability of theelectroporesis mediated gene delivery is still very limited due tolack of efficient models and proper control strategies. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first work aiming at developing controlenabled model for automating the gene delivery process. The paperhas revealed the major difficulties and presented a useful controlstrategy. As an effort to move the research from theory to practiceby using automation technology, we learned that it is critical tohave an efficient practical model. However, this is a challengingtask. The paper may offer some insight in this regard.
