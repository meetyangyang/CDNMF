Designing a decoupled XY micromanipulator for the applications such as scanning probe microscope andbiological cell manipulation is the major concern of this research,and a new manipulator employing parallel mechanism with flexurehinges is proposed. The dimensions of the XY stage are optimizedwith respect to precision and accuracy under constraints on itskinematics, statics, and dynamics performances. The manipulatoris fabricated from Al alloy via the wire-electrical discharge machining (EDM) process. In order to compensate for the nonlinearity introduced by the piezoelectric actuator (PZT), joint levelfeedback control is adopted. To ensure the manipulation accuracyperformed by the micromanipulator, both kinematic calibrationand online servo control are carried out by processing images captured through a microscope vision system. The experimental results show that the designed micromanipulator is sufficient for applications with not rigorous requirements, whereas its accuracycan be further improved which heavily depends on measuring instruments available.
