The integration of CAD/CAM with femtosecond lasers allows for MEMS rapid prototyping and bulkmicromachining technologies. The development of efficient toolsand algorithms for 2 1/2 D engineering surfaces are essential forfabricating a range of single to multilayer customized transducers.The objective of this research is to mainly develop methodologiesto identify and compensate for geometrical errors and surfacemetrology during fabrication process. The investigations introduced in this paper utilize Modified TPS algorithms. The developedalgorithms are implemented in MATLAB with the emphasis on theneed for error compensation techniques. In the future, the reverseengineering and compensation algorithms will be interfaced andutilized in the FLM to machine micro and nanosize features.
