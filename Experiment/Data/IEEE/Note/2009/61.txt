The practical motivation of this paper is summarized as follows. First, we would like to develop an indoor wireless localization network that is particularly useful for the position estimation ofstationary and/or slowly moving objects. The sensor network developed inthis paper can be variously used for factory automation, home automation,robot navigation/guidance, and pedestrian tracking. Second, the environmental-adaptive RSSI-based indoor localization (EARIL) algorithm developed in this paper is based on received signal strength; so the system is verysimple and the implementation cost is much cheaper than typical TOA andTDOA-based methods
