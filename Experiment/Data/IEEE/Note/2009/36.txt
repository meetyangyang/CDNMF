Detecting failures in robotic systems is critical totheir autonomous operation since it allows mitigating/compensating control strategies to be brought into play. In this paper, we employ multiobjective genetic programming to derive (near-)optimal feature extraction stagesfor failure detection which we demonstrate to yield significantly better detection performance than a range of comparator methods on benchmarkdatasets. Our approach requires no domain knowledge.
