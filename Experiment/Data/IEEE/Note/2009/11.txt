The surface segmentation strategies described in this work can be applied to surfaces that are composedof approximately extruded surface patches joined together by regions of high curvature; such surfaces include typical automotivesurfaces. The segmentation procedure allows the user to automatically generate a collection of preliminary coverage trajectories.With careful selection and minor clean up, these trajectories canimprove the coverage uniformity for a given surface. The procedure operates on a surface CAD model, preferably in the triangulated manifold format and requires information about the materialdistribution (or removal) pattern produced from the atomizer (ormachining) tool. With an understanding of the relative costs associated with different output characteristics such as uniformity ofdeposition, cycle time, and material waste, the procedures can beincorporated in existing industrial planning and simulation tools(with appropriate support from the software vendor) for applications such as robotic spray painting and CNC machining.
