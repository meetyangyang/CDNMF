This paper was motivated by the problem ofrouting shipments in integrated automatic shipment handling systems.Existing approaches to routing shipments in automatic systems generallyadopt an optimizer for arranging the sequence of requests within a certainperiod of time or a predetermined routing table based on static status. Thispaper suggests a new approach based on a nonlinear flow problem withthe consideration of congestion effects to allocate the usage of multiplepaths in routing tables. This nonlinear flow problem can be updated byreal information, thus high efficiencies can be maintained in differentscenarios. In this paper, we mathematically characterize the mechanicsand conditions for shipments to be routed simultaneously in integratedautomatic shipment handling systems. We then show the model of suchproblem by a nonlinear flow problem and approximated by a linear model;this can use a solver to compute efficiently and provide seamless decisions.Simulation experiments suggest that this approach is beneficial. In futureresearch, we will address the incorporation of probabilistic informationabout the demand and the equipment behavior, and fully test the solutionin production.
