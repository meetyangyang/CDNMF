This paper discusses a method to control a highperformance drilling process in a network-based application. A neurofuzzysystem learns direct and inverse dynamics of the process through input/output data, and creating direct and inverse models. Both models are introduced in an internal model control scheme. The main goal is to control the cutting force through a communication network by modifying thefeed rate. As detailed in a case study, the proposed method performs betterthan the PID control strategy. The main advantages of the suggested approach are the use of a neurofuzzy system to deal with nonlinear drillingprocess behavior and process uncertainty, and the elimination of the needfor an exact mathematical model to design/tune the control system. Instead,input/output experimental data are used to obtain direct and inverse neurofuzzy models.
