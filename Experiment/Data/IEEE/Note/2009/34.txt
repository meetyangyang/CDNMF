It is important that failures be diagnosed withina bounded delay of their occurrences and before any safety conditions areviolated. The notion of safe diagnosability captures this requirement. Thispaper provides a condition a system must satisfy so that any failure canbe safely diagnosed by one or more of the diagnosers acting independentlyof each other. Our results provide the insight that the safe diagnosabilityproperty can be separated into the property of diagnosability together withthe normality of the “boundary safe behaviors.” The condition presentedcan be verified polynomially, improving the exponential complexity of anearlier work. The synthesis of a decentralized set of diagnosers as well asthe online diagnosis using them is also of polynomial complexity.
