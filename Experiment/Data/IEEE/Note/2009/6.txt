Abstract-A self-contained direction sensing radio frequencyidentification (RFID) reader is developed employing a dual-directional antenna for automated target acquisition and dockingof a mobile robot in indoor environments. The dual-directionalantenna estimates the direction of arrival (DOA) of signals froma transponder by using the ratio of the received signal strengthsbetween two adjacent antennas. This enables the robot to continuously monitor the changes in transponder directions andensures reliable docking guidance to the target transponder. Oneof the technical challenges associated with this RFID directionfinding is to sustain the accuracy of the estimated DOA that variesaccording to environmental conditions. It is often the case thatthe robot loses its way to the target in a cluttered environment.To cope with this problem, the direction correction algorithm isproposed to triangulate the location of the transponder with themost recent three DOA estimates. Theoretical simulation resultsverify the reliability of the proposed algorithm that quantifies thepotential error in the DOA estimation. Using the algorithm, wevalidate mobile robot docking to an RFID transponder in an officeenvironment occupied by obstacles.
