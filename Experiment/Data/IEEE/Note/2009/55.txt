In this paper, we proposed the Scale-ICP algorithm, which is used to deal with the registration between two data setswith scale stretches. In practice, there are a large number of such problems. For example, the registration between the range data sets that havedifferent scanning resolutions determined by the distances from the sensorto the object surfaces. The data sets can be not only image data but alsothe other measured data, and hence it also can be extended to machining industry besides the computer vision field.
