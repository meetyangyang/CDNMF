From an optical system design perspective, it is particularly challenging to design and manufacture optical imaging systems that simultaneously achieve high resolution,a wide field-of-view, and a flat image field. Consequently, a costeffective and common solution is to use off-the-shelf microscopeobjectives for biomedical imaging applications. However, due tooptical limitations and a finite number of pixels on the camera, the field size (observable region of the specimen) is quite smallat high resolution. A common solution is to use a moving stageto translate the specimen underneath the microscope. However,for high-throughput imaging or for challenging biological observations, the moving stage is limited by a relatively slow dynamic speedand agitation of the specimen or workspace. A new microscope design, called the ASOM uses a recently commercialized MEMS deformable mirror technology in a novel optical configuration to expand the field-of-view without sacrificing resolution. Described aspart of a microscope imaging workstation, the ASOM has the potential to improve throughput, increase productivity, and performchallenging spatial-temporal observations in certain biological andmedical applications.
