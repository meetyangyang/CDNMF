This paper is motivated by the problemthat the tolerance information in current CAD systems lacks thenecessary engineering semantics, which causes tolerance information cannot be correctly used and impedes the integration of CADand CAM. Existing approaches have partially solved the problembased on variational geometry. However, the computational efficiency with the variational geometry method is very insufferablebecause of a lot of Boolean intersection operation. In this study,we try to propose an approach to uniformly and rigorously interpreting tolerance semantics for complicated tolerance specification (CTS). First, the tolerance is reclassified into three categories: Immovable-TZ (ITZ) tolerance, Translational-TZ (TTZ)tolerance, and Floatable-TZ (FTZ) tolerance. By the reclassification, the number of tolerance types to be considered for semanticinterpretation is reduced dramatically, which makes the task of semantic interpretation of tolerance much easier. Second, with thehelp of the variation along degrees of freedom direction (VDOF)for CTSs, a uniform method of interpreting the rigorous tolerancesemantics is presented. Here, the big difficulty for implementationof the interpretation of tolerance semantics is the computational efficiency. In order to overcome it, we propose a novel method to determine the TZ boundary without performing Boolean intersectionoperations in 3-D CAD systems. Finally, we implement all the algorithm with Visual C++ 6.0 and geometric modeling engine ACIS6.0. We also give some examples with test results and analysis.
