Arrangements of Bézier curves havenumerous applications in computer graphics and solid modeling.In this paper we present the first complete implementation thatcan construct arrangements of Bézier curves of any degree, andhandle all degenerate cases in a robust and efficient manner.Our approach combines exact algebraic techniques with efficientfiltering methods based on the geometric properties of Béziercurves. We show the value and efficiency of our approach bycomparing it to exact approaches and to traditional floating-pointimplementations. The C++ code is publicly available for use in thelatest release of the CGAL library (Version 3.3). Our implementation currently supports only Bézier curves. In the future, we planto extend our work to rational Bézier and NURBS curves. We alsoplan to investigate other representations to improve the efficiencyof the geometric filtering techniques we use.
