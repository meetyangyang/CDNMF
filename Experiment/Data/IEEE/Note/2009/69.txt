Contouring errors significantly affect theCNC machining accuracy. Successfully addressing this problemwill produce great impact to the manufacturing industry. Thispaper presents a useful solution to minimize the contouring errorsof CNC machine tools, using a novel idea of synchronization approach. Both theoretical and experimental studies reported in thispaper show that the proposed methodology can be readily appliedto minimize the contour errors in CNC machine applications.
