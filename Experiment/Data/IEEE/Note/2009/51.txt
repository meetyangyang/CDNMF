Micropipette aspiration is a widely usedtechnique for characterizing mechanical properties of individualbiological cells. Automated cell contour measurements can provevery useful for users of micropipette aspiration to avoid hours oflaborious postprocessing, which is necessary with existing systems.Furthermore, compared with manual measurements, sub-pixeltracking of cell deformation parameters leads to a higher accuracyin quantifying cell mechanical properties.
