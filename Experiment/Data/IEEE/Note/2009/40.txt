Building a one-to-one smooth correspondence between two solid geometric models is a fundamentalproblem. It directly applies to shape registration: when we havetwo solid shapes matched, we can easily compute and visualize foranalysis purpose where and how much do they differ. Anotherimportant application is generating regular connectivity for arbitrary solid objects. This is performed by transferring regularstructure from a canonical object to our target object once thecorrespondence (mapping) is created. Given two solid models, wecan automatically compute a physically natural mapping betweenthem. This “physically natural” property is characterized byso called harmonicity, which measures the smoothness of themapping function, and is represented by the harmonic energy. Amap with minimized harmonic energy means it is smoothest andnatural; and our algorithm gets such a mapping. We show thedesirable property of our map using applications such as shape comparison, tetrahedral mesh regularization, and solid texturesynthesis. These applications in turn demonstrate the strong potential of our volumetric mappings. Our method is so far the first“meshless” attempt in computer graphics and modeling field forcomputing harmonic volumetric map, and it outperforms otherexisting techniques in smoothness, stability, and computationalefficiency. The computational complexity of our algorithm is onlysolving a dense linear system. Furthermore, once the coefficientmatrix is decomposed, it can be reused very efficiently wheneverthe boundary condition changes—only a matrix-vector multiplication is necessary for the new mapping computation. In our currentwork, the behavior of the volumetric mapping in the interiorregion is determined by the shell boundary correspondence, andwe will pursue mapping with free boundary constraints in thefuture.
