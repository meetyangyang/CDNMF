The proposed work presents a new activevision paradigm. While traditional active vision systems control theacquisition only by moving the cameras to keep an object of interestin the field-of-view, the proposed solution extends such a conceptby introducing the control of the image creation process. The objective is to keep the objects of interest within the field-of-view andat the same time to acquire it with an optimal quality. This is an interesting feature as it allows to focus the attention only on the areasof interest on which our system is interested in thus improving theperformance of the image processing tasks. To achieve such an objective, we propose a neural network hierarchy that is able to findout the optimal configuration of the intrinsic camera parameters(focus and iris) in a fast way. This result is even more important ifwe think that it can be achieved regardless the dimension and theposition of the area of interest inside the image.
