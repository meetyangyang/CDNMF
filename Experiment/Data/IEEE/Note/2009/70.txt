From a process engineering point ofview, the purpose of GC control should not only achieve a perfecttracking of the controlled variables with respect to their setpoints,but also realize the optimization of production indices, namely theproduct particle size and the grinding production rate. However,these production indices cannot be optimized solely by the lowerlevel control systems (LLCS) because of the process complexityand time-varying nature of the grinding operation. As a result,the operator is needed to determine the setpoints of each controlloop of the LLCS using operational experience. Unfortunately,the manual operation cannot ensure that the actual productionindices meet with technical requirements. In this paper, an IOSCapproach is developed for the GC so as to optimize the concernedproduction indices. In a detailed description, this IOSC approachis composed of a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based loop pre-setting controller, a NN based particle size soft-sensor module and afuzzy adjustor, and is used to auto-adjust the setpoints of lowerlevel controllers under the varying boundary conditions. As longas the outputs of the LLCS track their renewed setpoints, theprocess can optimize the production indices and achieve the desired performance of the system. The proposed approach has beensuccessfully applied to the grinding process of a large hematitemineral processing plant in China. It is believed that the results ofthis paper can be extended to a wide range of processes with thesimilar feature that the production indices cannot be optimizedsolely by the human supervised LLCS.
