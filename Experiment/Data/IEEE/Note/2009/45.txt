Modular and hierarchical modelingand analysis becomes more important as systems are increasingly complicated (Sargent et al., 1993). DEVS formalism is amodular and hierarchical formalism in which the user buildsa system by connecting system components, and the systemcan be a component in a bigger system. In addition, the practitioners can use all source codes of the algorithm and theverification example proposed in this paper which are availableat http://xsy-csharp.sourceforge.net/DEVSsharp. User friendlyinterfaces for the expression of FD-DEVS and its translationto XML and DEVSJAVA can be found at http://www.u.arizona.edu/%7Esaurabh/fddevs/FD-DEVS.html.
