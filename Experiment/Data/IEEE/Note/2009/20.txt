The recent growth in the number oflaboratories and companies using zebrafish in vertebrate developmental genetics and pharmaceutical research has beenexponential. The injection of thousands of zebrafish embryos isrequired on a daily basis in a moderate-sized zebrafish laboratory/company, for applications such as embryonic developmentstudies, mutation screening to identify genes, and drug moleculescreening for drug discovery. The fully automated injectionsystem and the embryo holding devices presented in this paperwere developed to meet the requirements of high throughput andhigh reproducibility. Experimental results demonstrate that thesystem is reliable, operates at a high speed, and provides a highsuccess rate and survival rate, capable of replacing or assisting ahuman operator for large-scale cell injection.
