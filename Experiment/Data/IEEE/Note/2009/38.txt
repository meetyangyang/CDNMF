Abstractâ€”Self replication is a kind of self-assembly in which a desiredstructure is obtained automatically from simple parts. We propose selfreplication not by controlling the parts directly, but by controlling theirenvironment, namely passive self-replication, which makes self-replicatingstructures by imitating the semi-conservative replication of DNA. The proposed self-replication strategy is available for multiple types of parts byintroducing selective surface structures on parts and two different bondingforces.
