In closed production lines, parts aretransported throughout the system on pallets. Clearly, this couldimpede the system performance since the first operation maybe starved for pallets and the last may be blocked by full emptypallets buffer. Therefore, it is important to establish conditions onthe number of pallets and the capacity of the empty pallets buffer,under which the impediment does not take place. This paperprovides such conditions under the assumption that the operationsobey a simple (Bernoulli) reliability model. In addition, this paperprovides a method for identification of bottlenecks in closed lines.Future work will extend these results to systems with exponentialand non-Markovian reliability model.
