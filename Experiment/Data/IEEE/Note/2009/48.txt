Vision-based techniques are now an integral part of microassembly systems. During microassembly, a vision system initially needs to detect micro parts which are usuallyspread over a large area, yet maintain high resolution for the finalstate. The tradeoff between DOF (FOV) and resolution, commonto many vision-based microassembly systems, does not allow thefulfillment of this requirement. In this paper, an active zoomingcontrol method is proposed to adjust the FOV and DOF dynamically according to the position and focus measure of micro objects.Several constraints such as FOV, focus measure, and joint limitsare integrated by the proposed method using an artificial potentialfield. Stability and robustness issues, central to realistic automationapplications, are also analyzed. The simulation and experimentalresults verify potential application of the proposed method in vision-based microassembly.
