Fixtures are widely used to locate andhold workpieces in automated manufacturing, assembly, and inspection. A number of quality measures have been proposed in theliterature for quantifying the locating accuracy and the capabilityof fixtures in resisting external loads, which are usually consideredas the two basic functional requirements for fixturing devices.This paper presents a comparative study on several widely usednumerical measures. As the main theoretical results, we establisha set of inequalities, which describe the relations and distinctionsbetween different measures. Extensive comparisons have also beencarried out with simulation studies. The results show that in orderto select an appropriate quality measure for fixture layout design,the geometry of the workpieces and the task of manipulationshould be taken into account. As it is unreasonable to make ageneral ranking among different measures, this paper providesa recommendation on appropriate optimality criteria for severalspecific tasks of fixturing. We hope the comparisons provide aninsight to practitioners for designing and/or evaluating fixtures.
