This paper demonstrates how to use a finite centralbuffer to augment previously published supervisory controllers. These controllers guarantee that if a workstation fails, parts in the system requiringthat workstation do not block the production of other parts not requiringthe workstation. Workstation failure can be tool breakage, hydraulic, electrical, or pneumatic failure, sensor failure, or any other type of event thatcauses a workstation to stop producing. These controllers can be easily implemented on supervisory computers in the control hierarchy and interfaced with PLC control logic
