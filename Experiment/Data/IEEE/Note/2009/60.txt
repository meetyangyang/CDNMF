Heterogeneity poses challenges to systemdesign of WHSN. Practical applications require a distributedtopology control algorithm to ensure reliability as well as powerefficiency. Existing approaches for topology control either requirecentralized controller to obtain network graph globally, or lack of theoretical analysis. In this paper, a new game theoretic modelyields decentralized optimization for joint topology control andpower management. Global game equilibriums are iterativelyreached by considering individual node degree, message deliveryratio and cost of increasing power. Based on mathematical gameanalysis, we provide two solution concepts for implementations.The NEPow scheme is derived from Nash Equilibrium of staticgame model. The BEPow scheme, derived from Bayesian NashEquilibrium of incomplete-information dynamic game model, isdedicated to the scenario involving heterogeneous types (short ofpower or full of power) of nodes with adjustable power levels. Thesimulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms arefeasible to achieve desirable performances, in terms of connectivity, packet reception rate, throughput, and power efficiency. Thebelief-updating algorithm in Bayesian game is shown effective fordifferent types of sensors to determine their power levels interactively and consistently without causing performance degradation.Both algorithms are simulated in packet-level network simulatorand ready to be ported to real test-bed with slight modification.
