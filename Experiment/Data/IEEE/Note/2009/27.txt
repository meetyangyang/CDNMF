Fault detection, isolation, and recoveryapproaches are important for maintaining performance andsafety in large safety-critical systems, such as the Advanced LifeSupport (ALS) System for future long-duration NASA mannedmissions that we present in this paper. These systems consist of anumber of complex, interacting, spatially distributed subsystems.Centralized model-based diagnosis approaches are expensive inmemory and communication requirements, and they create singlepoints of failure. Previous distributed diagnosis approaches applyto discrete-event system models, but these approaches becomecomputationally intractable when applied to complex continuoussystems. This paper develops a systematic model-based approachto distributing the diagnosis task by designing multiple diagnosersthat operate independently and generate globally correct diagnoses. We present a complete approach that includes a topologicalmodeling scheme for constructing the dynamic system models,algorithms for constructing the distributed diagnosers, and asystematic methodology for deriving efficient subsystem diagnosisusing these diagnosers. We then demonstrate the applicability ofthis approach to the ALS system.
