This paper studies the problem of decentralized failure diagnosis in discrete event systems. This is relevantfor diagnosis of large scale distributed systems such as communication networks, manufacturing systems, and power systems.Multiple decision-makers observe the behaviors of an underlyingsystem using their own set of sensors, and jointly diagnose theoccurrence of a failure based on their observations of the systembehavior together with an inference of the self-ambiguity andthose of the others. Each diagnosis decision of a decision-maker istagged with an ambiguity level, and an overall diagnosis decisionis taken to be a diagnosis decision with a minimum ambiguity level. A notion of -inference F-diagnosability is introducedas a condition under which each failure is diagnosed within abounded number of steps (or “delay”) of its occurrence by oneof the decision-makers, and the ambiguity levels of all winningdecisions are upper bounded by . Properties of -inferenceF-diagnosable system and specification pairs are studied and analgorithm for verifying the property of -inference F-diagnosability is presented.
