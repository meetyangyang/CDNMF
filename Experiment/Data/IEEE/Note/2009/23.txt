A control algorithm is proposed to develop an artificial pancreas. Practical issues on feasibility and applicability are discussed in context of blood glucose management inT1DM; some advantages and drawbacks are commented as well.An artificial pancreas is composed by: an insulin pump, a glucose sensor, and a controller to adjust the delivered insulin. Thishas motivated to the scientific community to propose each partseparately. Complementarily, the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has approved continuous glucose monitoring and insulinpump as parts in the developing of an artificial pancreas. The FDAhas assented the integration of the parts towards a feedback loopto control the blood glucose levels via insulin therapy. Automaticinsulin delivery system in clinical trial was made, where the useof a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) were linked with a control algorithm. Some efforts are devoted to form the “skeleton” ofthe artificial pancreas given by control systems for blood glucose inT1DM. The trials have shown the blood glucose was in euglycemicrange 75% under closed-loop versus 63% under open-loop configuration. Nevertheless, more flexible algorithms are needed to adjust the insulin delivery rate according to changes in blood glucose levels. These control systems are designed to compute automatically an insulin delivery rate. Because the complexity of thebiomedical systems, the theory is potentially the mathematical tool to derive the best possible controller from the theory viewpoint
