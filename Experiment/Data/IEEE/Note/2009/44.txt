This paper is a further contribution towards bridging the subject of computer representations for solidand physical modeling—which flourished borderline between computer graphics, engineering mechanics and computer science withits own methods and data structures—under the general cover oflinear algebra and algebraic topology. The main advantage of suchan approach is that topology, geometry and physics may coexist inone and the same formalized framework, concurring together todefine, represent and simulate the behavior of the model. Last butnot least, our tensor-based approach is a significant step forwardin achieving close integration of geometrical representations andphysics-based simulations, i.e., in the concurrent modeling of shapeand behavior. Contrary to what might appear at first sight, the theoretical complexity of the present approach is not greater than thatof current methods, provided that sparse-matrix techniques withdouble element access (by rows and by columns) are exploited.
