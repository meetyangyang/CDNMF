In biological cell injection, the control of injection forces is important since excessive manipulation force may destroy themembrane or tissue of the biological cell, and lead to failure of the biomanipulation task. Although the injection force is a very important factor thataffects the survivability of the injected cells, research on minimally invasivecell injection, based on understanding of the mechanical properties of thecellular membrane, are rare. To resolve this problem, a methodology is presented here to regulate cell injection forces using geometry of cell deformations and micro vision feedback. With the visually measured injection forceapplied to an injected cell, an impedance control strategy is then developedto regulate the cell injection force through the desired impedance. One advantage of using the impedance control in micromanipulation is that tinyforces exerted on the cell membrane can be reflected in the control systemby adjusting the controller impedance coefficients.
