When any single web service fails to accomplish service requestorâ€™s multiple function requirements, multiple web services are needed to form a service composition. Thiswork deals with automatic configuration of services under practical constraints. First, according to the customized or applicationspecific web service functional requirement, discover all the webservices. Second, build a complete service functional dependencyconfiguration net based on Petri nets. Third, choose and computethe quality-of-service (QoS) attributes for the whole configuration.A transformation method is utilized to change nonlinear aggregation functions to linear ones. Relative importance of different attributes is represented through subjective preference or perception. Fourth, compute the QoS attribute value for each real webservice. An association algorithm translates and compiles QoS attributes. Finally, the linear programming problem is set and solved.The best configuration is found and sensitivity analysis is carriedout. The concepts and developed algorithms can be readily put intoindustrial applications.
