This paper describes the design and useof an automated precision multirobot system, the , for thepackaging of mircooptoelectromechanical systems (MOEMS).The emphasis is on assembly and packaging as opposed to assembly alone due to the fact that bonding, sealing, and attachmentprocesses greatly influence the reliability of the microsystem. Thesystem components include precision robots, microstages, end-effectors, and fixtures that accomplish assembly tasks in a sharedworkspace along with bonding process tools. High assembly yieldis guaranteed by the application of so-called RRA precision designrules. We present experimental results demonstrating how aMEMS optical switch is assembled within a specified tolerancebudget, with high yield, using a systematic and minimalist hardware approach.
