Abstractâ€”Lighting control systems provide various benefits inbuilding management, and Building Automation and Control Network (BACnet) is an international standard data communicationprotocol for building automation and control networks. We introduce a reference model for BACnet-based lighting control systemsand evaluate its performance using an experimental model. The experimental results show that the system can reduce the energy consumption for lighting loads by 40%. Stable operation of the controlsystem is guaranteed below a certain threshold of network traffic.
