Existing calibration methods of automaticzoom cameras solve in general some equations based on commonfeatures of a sequence of images. This limits the possibility of calibrating each single image and lets the solution dependent on theaccuracy of the features. In this paper, we propose an algorithmbased on curve fitting methods. The camera is first calibrated offline at several settings of the zoom and the focus to obtain somemeasurement points. The unmeasured values are then interpolatedby approximating each variable with local polynomial functions.The results obtained show that the method is feasible to be appliedin practice. As future work, we will try to address the problem ofinterpolating the intrinsic parameters, while taking into accounttheir interdependency.
