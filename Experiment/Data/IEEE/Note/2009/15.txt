This paper presents an automatic reconfiguration method for PN supervisors of RMS in response to RMSconfiguration changes. First, INRSs are introduced that can dynamically change the structure of a PN with preserving its important behavioral properties. Second, a method for designing a classof PN controllers is proposed with an approach of INRS. Third,the INRS-based method for reconfiguration of this class of controllers is presented as well. Using this method, an existing controller can be reconfigured rapidly and validly with reconfiguration of the RMS. Finally, a reconfigurable manufacturing cell isprovided for illustrating the presented reconfiguration method.
