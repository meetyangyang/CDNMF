Abstractâ€”This paper describes a concerted effort to design and implement a robotic service framework. The proposed framework is comprisedof three conceptual spaces: physical, semantic, and virtual spaces, collectively referred to as a ubiquitous robotic space. We implemented a prototype robotic security application in an office environment, which confirmedthat the proposed framework is an efficient tool for developing a roboticservice employing IT infrastructure, particularly for integrating heterogeneous technologies and robotic platforms.
