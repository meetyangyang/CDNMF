Web services are an emerging area forbusiness process automation. This work presents a novel and fundamental framework to analyze and compose web services. It isbased on CPNs and a newly proposed concept called Communicating Reachability Graph. Given any two services developed usingBusiness Process Execution Language, the proposed method converts them into CPNs and analyzes their compatibility. Meanwhile,it finds out if a message mediator exists in case of partial compatibility. If so, it is synthesized. A real-life case is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed concepts and method. They canbe readily used in industrial web service composition for businessautomation.
