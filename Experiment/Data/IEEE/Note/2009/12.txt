This paper presents an algorithm thatimproves previous approaches in terms of efficiency in the determination of the optimal object constraint maximizing the minimumwrench that the object can support in any direction. The problemcan always be solved using numerical optimization techniques butwhen time is relevant an efficient algorithm becomes of interest.Practical applications include optimal determination of fixturesand object grasps.
