This paper was motivated by a jointindustrial project which uses CATIA V5R16 as the design platform. The shape of product was modeled by free-form parametricpatches including NURBS in the CATIA system. For efficientmanufacturing, the parametric surfaces are required to convertinto developable patches with controllable global error bounds.Given a small tolerance, if this cannot be achieved, then cut thesurface into pieces, each of which is developable. However, theCATIA system does not provide such a functionality. With thedevelopment of this project, we design an efficient algorithmwhich is presented in the paper to achieve this goal. We also buildthe algorithm into a plugin module in CATIA using CAA V5.
