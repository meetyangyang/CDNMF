Monitoring of metal transfer process is a fundamental step toward intelligent control of gas metal arc welding process andits modifications. However, the metal transfer rate may exceed over 100 Hzand its monitoring requires high frame rate images so that the resolutionof the image is relatively low. Due to the low-resolution and harsh weldingenvironment, automated processing of the images for droplet identificationand computation is challenging. This paper proposes a system of solutionsto process the low-resolution images to obtain robust and accurate estimation of the droplet location and size. Experiments verified the effectivenessof the proposed solutions and future work will focus on algorithm optimization and high speed processor implementation to improve the speedfor real-time control of droplet trajectory and size which are required forfuture precision manufacturing applications.
