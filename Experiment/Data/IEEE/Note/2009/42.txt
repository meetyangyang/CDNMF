Geometric kernels in commercial CADsystems typically use B-splines to represent smooth curves and surfaces. Geometric inquiry (such as curvature) on such curves andsurfaces requires the fundamental mathematical operation of multiplying two B-splines. There are a few existing algorithms in theCAD community to perform B-spline multiplication. All of themare indirect methods, in the sense of either by some sampling andinterpolation strategy, or leaving the domain of B-spline representation. The only direct multiplication, reported in early 1990s, actually only solved the problem from a purely mathematical perspective. It is so inefficient as to be not feasible for any practical usage.The presented paper re-exams this initial idea of direct B-splinemultiplication, and finds some simple characteristics of the apparently combinatorial problem, and designs a set of efficient algorithms, known as Sliding Window Algorithm (SWA).
