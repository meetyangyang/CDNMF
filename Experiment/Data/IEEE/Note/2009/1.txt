Manufacturing an RFID tag requiresmany companies to be involved in the production flow. Eachmanufacturing process impacts the behavior of the tags, both inhomogeneous and heterogeneous populations. The specificationand design of a chip are the first steps in the production of tagsthat tend to introduce the most variation. However, the chipattachment and label conversion as the last steps impact greatlythe physical performance characteristics and tag quality such asrange and consistency of behavior across different use models.This paper presents a new approach that provides a way toquantify the quality of various passive RFID tags. The proposedmeasurement methodology eliminates typical problems associatedwith the direct or probe base type measurements. In this paper,the complete test system has been presented. The experimentalresults suggest that the proposed methodology is practical and canbe applied during the design phase or in the production flow forcontinuous monitoring of the quality of the tags.
