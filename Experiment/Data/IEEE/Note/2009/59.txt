This system aims to achieve non-obtrusive and location-aware activity recognition, and the authors havesuccessfully prototyped several AICOs to naturally collect interactions from residents or status from the environment. In addition, these AICOs have the potential to be commercialized in thefuture due to practicability and near-term advances in embeddedsystems. Furthermore, other potential advantages of an AICO liein its applicability to other domains beyond just the home environment. Our initial work has yielded high overall accuracy, therefore,suggesting that it is a feasible approach that may lead to practicalambient intelligent applications (such as the Activity Map in thiswork). The limitations are that some currently available sensorscannot measure specific desired observations, or, in some cases, require users to carry them to operate.
