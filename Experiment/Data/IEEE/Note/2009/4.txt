This paper was motivated by the tagcollision problem in RFID systems with battery-powered, transmitter-only tags. Many RFID applications (e.g., real-time locationtracking, wireless sensing, and access control) can employ tagswithout on-board receiver, which reduces the costs and extendsthe battery lifetime. However, in case of lack of the feedbackchannel, it is not possible to repeat transmission when the collisionoccurs in radio channel. This paper suggests a new approach usingdirect-sequence code division multiple access transmission withrandom selection of coding channels. Because of good correlationproperties of the transmitted signals, it is possible to correctly receive frames from different tags transmitting simultaneously. Thisway the risk of loss of information caused by collisions is reducedand the system reliability is improved. In this paper, we mathematically analyze the probability of tag detection, false alarm, and thesystem capacity. We then show the results of computer simulationsthat confirm the obtained theoretical formulae. The analysis of thesystem capacity assumes equal power of the signals received fromall tags, which may be far from real situations. In future research,we will investigate the case of receiving signals with differentpower levels. The impact of multipath propagation has also to beinvestigated. The proposed system can be implemented with usinglow-cost microcontrollers in tags and programmable logic devicesin readers. Such a system can be used in location tracking andwireless sensing applications, where numerous RFID tags operateat the same time and transmit their radio signals unaware of eachother.
