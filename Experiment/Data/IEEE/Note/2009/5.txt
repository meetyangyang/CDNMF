It is difficult to physically test and validate the effectiveness of novel approaches that improve the speed atwhich large RFID tag populations can be identified and/or addresssome of the privacy and security concerns associated with RFID.An accurate evaluation of each protocol concept ideally requires acustomized microchip and new reader firmware, which is prohibitively expensive in many cases. Board-level emulators are anothermethod for testing new ideas in RFID. However, it is difficult to emulate the power-up limitations of passive RFID tags with poweredcircuits. Furthermore, a variety of real-world scenarios must berecreated and tested to truly understand the performance of a newidea. Examples include reading hundreds of tagged cases in palletsbeing carried on a forklift, items moving at 2 m/s on a manufacturing line, and items moving on a conveyor. RFIDSim provides awell-controlled test environment to compare different approacheswithout the need to deploy hundreds of RFID tags and move themconsecutively past an RFID reader in experiments. RFIDSim canbe used to compare and classify different ideas in a variety of usescenarios and reduce the number of concepts which need to be prototyped. Due to the nature of the wireless channel, it is very challenging to accurately predict the signal strength distribution in aparticular application environment. RFIDSim is not capable of determining the exact zone, where a tag will be identified in a particular application. The objective of RFIDSim is to facilitate therelative comparison of different medium access protocols, transmission control strategies, settings in ISO 18000-6C, and privacyand security enhancements.
