Without using sensors, one method of positioning and orienting an isolated part on a plate is to subject thepart to a sequence of squeeze fields. Each squeeze field attracts thepart to a “squeeze line” until a stable configuration is reached. Thispaper describes how to vibrate a rigid plate so that frictional forcesmove an isolated part towards a squeeze line of arbitrary orientation. An optimal plate motion is presented that maximizes thespeed of point parts towards the squeeze line. Since the analysis isrestricted to point parts, a natural extension entails generalizingthe methods presented in this paper to handle parts with planarextent. Such a generalization may indicate that a rigid vibratingplate can serve as a sensorless universal parts feeder.
