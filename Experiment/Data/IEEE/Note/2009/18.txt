For a surveillance system with multiple cameras,the poses of cameras may be changed from time to time to acquire differentviews of the monitored scene. Whenever the poses of cameras are changed,the relative positioning and orientation among cameras need to be recalibrated. In this paper, we demonstrate a new and efficient approach to calibrate multiple cameras dynamically. The concept of our approach originated from the observation that people usually can identify the directions ofthe pan and tilt angles, and even make a rough estimate about the changesof pan and tilt angles, simply based on some clues revealed in the capturedimages.In our approach, a set of cameras are first calibrated based on a staticcalibration method. As cameras begin to pan or tilt, the images of thesecameras change accordingly. We keep extracting and tracking a few feature points from these images. Based on the displacement of these featurepoints in consecutive images, the pan and tilt angle changes of the cameras can be automatically estimated via the proposed approach. There isno need to place calibration patterns or landmarks while performing dynamic calibration. In addition, there is no need to perform the complicatedcorrespondence of feature points among cameras. The proposed approachis practical for a wide-range surveillance system with multiple cameras andis applicable for complicated environments. In the future, we will combinethe proposed approach with an object tracking system to develop an efficient active surveillance system with multiple cameras.
