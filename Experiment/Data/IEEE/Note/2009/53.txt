In order to reduce the energy dissipated in a threejointed vertically articulated manipulator, this paper proposes an optimalmethod for simultaneously determining eight design variables, which arethree motor masses, three reduction gear ratios, a counterbalancer massand a offset. The proposed design method can reduce the dissipated energymore effectively than an inertia matching method.
