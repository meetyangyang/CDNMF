In this paper, we present a methodologythat would allow the automation of the refinement of AVI algorithms. In particular, the proposed method identifies a set of components, or cluster of components, for which a particular set of inspection features or algorithms, renders a certain level of inspection reliability. This is particularly useful for adapting preexistingsystems to inspect new components, especially when the characteristics of the new components are similar to those of components already inspected by the inspection system. We applied this methodology to a case of study of the inspection of SMDs.
