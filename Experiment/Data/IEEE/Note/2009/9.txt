Compliant motion tasks are manipulationtasks that involve contacts between a rigid object manipulated by arobot and a rigid static environment in which it operates. Since thetrajectory of the manipulator must be modified depending on theforces arising in the interaction, the robot controller must know ateach configuration the space of possible generalized velocities, ortwists, of the manipulated object that keep all the established contacts with the environment and the space of generalized forces, orwrenches, that might arise in the interaction between them. Theyare called twist and wrench spaces, respectively. In this paper, thekinestatics, i.e., the statics and instantaneous kinematics, of a rigidobject constrained by one to six contacts with a rigid static environment is studied. Under the frictionless assumption, each contact isdescribed by means of a kinematic chain that, instantaneously, isstatically and kinematically equivalent to the contact.The kinestatics of the resulting parallel kinematic chain isstudied using the Grassmann¨CCayley algebra, a mathematicalformalism that incorporates specific tools for the analysis ofserial and parallel connections of motion constraints acting onrigid bodies. Computing twist and wrench spaces of rigid bodiesconstrained by several contacts with a rigid static environmententails computing intersections and sums of the twist and wrenchspaces of the individual contact constraints, respectively. TheGrassmann¨CCayley algebra has a formula that allows closed-form expressions for the intersection of subspaces to be obtained. Bycomputing twist spaces of rigid bodies constrained by severalcontacts using this formula, we can ensure that their basis vectorscoincide with some of the joint twists of the kinematic chainsinstantaneously equivalent to the contacts. This makes it easierto understand the results, simpler to specify the motion of themanipulated object and makes the updating of the model of thecontacts after a motion of the manipulated object less complicated.Furthermore, this formula allows us to cope with the problemscaused by floating point coordinate representations of sets ofvectors in which small round off errors can change the dimensionof the space they span.
