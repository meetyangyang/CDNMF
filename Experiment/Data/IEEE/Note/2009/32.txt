A variety of systems, such as manufacturing systems, computer networks, traffic systems, and others, canbe modeled as DESs at a higher level of abstraction. These modelscan then be used for the purpose of state estimation, supervisorycontrol, and fault diagnosis. Knowledge of the system state is always critical for controller design and fault diagnosis. In this paper,we study state estimation in DESs modeled by labeled Petri nets.This is a challenging problem because two different types of uncertainty can arise due to sensor limitations: a) occurrences of different activity (different transitions) may generate the same observation; b) occurrences of unobservable activity (silent transitions)go unrecorded. We show that, under some reasonable assumptionson the nature of the given Petri netâ€™s unobservable transition structure, the number of possible system states that are consistent withan observed sequence of events is upper bounded by a functionpolynomial in the length of the observation sequence. The implications are twofold: a) the state estimation problem can be solvedin a very general setting with complexity that is polynomial in thelength of the observation sequence and b) the polynomial boundcan guide the design of systems, especially when configuring the state transition sensors, to reduce the uncertainty introduced in thestate estimation stage.
