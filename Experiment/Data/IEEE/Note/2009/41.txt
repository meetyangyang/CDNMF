Molding is the process of manufacturinga part by shaping a pliable raw material, such as molten plastic ormetal, using a rigid mold. The material hardens and sets inside themold, adopting its shape. To remove the part from the mold withoutdestroying the mold, the mold must be made of multiple pieces.In the simplest case, a two-part mold is used, and these parts areseparated in opposite directions. The curves on the surface of thepart where the pieces of the mold meet are called “parting lines.”For a manufacturing perspective, a smooth parting line is moreapplicable than a theoretically correct parting line. We give a novelmethod to compute such a parting line in this paper.
