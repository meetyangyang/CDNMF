A 3D triangle mesh is composed of a geometric part (the vertex coordinates) and a connectivity part (thedescription of the triangles). In this paper, we show how to reencode such surface meshes in order to obtain near zero connectivitycost for some class of surface meshes (and very good rates in thegeneral case), while guaranteeing in the same time state-of-the-artgeometry encoding cost. This method can be useful in all application areas where the mesh size is a bottleneck (typically networkor storage applications). The best results are obtained for meshesmade from 3D scans (in contrast to CAD meshes). The main current limitations of the method are the computing times (about 1 sper 1000 points part of the mesh, for compression which can bedone offline) and the memory footprint.
