This paper proposes novel spatial analysis to detect the spatial distribution of mobile phones. It concerns the correlation of various spatial objects regarding their spatial and nonspatial dimensions to detect dependency among them. We have constructed a weighted neighbor list of spatial objects and implemented different autocorrelation tests regarding the variable of interests to compute spatial dependencies. By applying a Kernel Density method, we have identified the distributions. The results of density estimation demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and feasible. Such analysis can help organizations better implement monitoring and evaluation plans at all levels and make the necessary infrastructure improvement to satisfy user requirements.
