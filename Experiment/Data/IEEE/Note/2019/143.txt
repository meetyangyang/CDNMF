Robot grasping and dexterous, in-hand manipulations are typically executed with fully actuated robot hands that rely on analytical methods, computation of the hand object system Jacobians, and extensive numerical simulations for deriving optimal strategies. However, these hands require sophisticated sensing elements, complicated control laws, and are not robust to external disturbances or perception uncertainties. Recently, a new class of adaptive hands was proposed which uses structural compliance and underactuation (less motors than the available degrees of freedom) to offer increased robustness and simplicity. In this paper, we propose hybrid methodologies that blend analytical models with constrained optimization schemes and learning techniques to simplify the execution of dexterous, in-hand manipulation tasks with adaptive robot hands.
