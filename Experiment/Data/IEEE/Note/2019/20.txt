This paper is motivated by the visionbased force sensing mechanism. A coil spring marker is usedto visualize and locate the catheter tip in ultrasound images.The metallic helical structure of the marker can result in remarkable features in 2-D in-plane ultrasound images. A geometricalmodel-based detection algorithm is proposed to detect the passivemarker in initial frame regardless of its length and orientationvariation. A predictionâ€“detection-combined tracking algorithmis developed to automatically track the catheter tip for thesubsequent frames in real time. Most importantly, the distal forcecan be simultaneously estimated due to the length variation ofthe passive marker. The sensed force can be fed back to a roboticcatheterization system during intravascular interventions.
