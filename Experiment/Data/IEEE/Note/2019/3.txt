This paper was motivated by the complex problem of characterizing care transitions in an LTC network, based on integrated electronic health records. It exemplifiesthe beginning of a series of rigors investigations on modelingmultisite care transition networks. This line of research has greatpotential to lead to the development of intelligent decision supportsystems for LTC capacity planning and transition management,and eventually, empower care organizations to make data informed management decisions. Furthermore, the empiricalaspect of this paper was made possible by the availability ofa comprehensive care transition longitudinal data set, at theRegenstrief Institute, constructed from a multiyear follow-upstudy on an elderly cohort. This cohort was prospectively followedas it moved along a Midwestern United States urban LTC system.This problem is of great interest to population-level LTC policymakers and management of LTC providers. The majority of theexisting studies on LTC delivery have relied on cost-effectivenessanalysis based on aggregate spending data. Our study, on theother hand, focuses on characterizing time-to-transition event forpatients who reside at NH. Such a shift in focus in modeling atan increased level of granularity enhances our ability to evaluatethe impact of operational-level interventions on various outcomesof LTC delivery. Finally, the novelty of our study arises fromexploring useful transition history patterns to incorporate intothe parametric survival model and estimating resource use fromcensored data. Our research findings highlight the significance of:1) identifying the most informative time window for incorporationof transition history as a LOS predictor in NH and 2) accountingfor bias in transition time estimation arising from an individualtendency to stay longer or shorter in NH through frailty termsincorporated in the parametric survival model.
