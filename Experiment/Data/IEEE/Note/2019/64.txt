Tolerance allocation is an importantdesign task with significant impacts on cost and product quality.As the application of additive manufacturing (AM) for fabricating practical products (especially in critical industries) is increasing, it is important to develop the design and manufacturingstandards and guidelines for both designers and manufacturers.Currently, there is a lack of tolerance specification standardsand process capability evaluation of different AM processes.As a result, trial and error approaches are usually adopted todetermine the feasible tolerances and cost-effective process plans,which are time-consuming (especially due to the slow productionspeed of AM) and require extensive efforts. In this paper,a methodology is proposed where the design and manufacturingdecisions for assemblies with AM components can be madeconcurrently in a cost-effective way.
