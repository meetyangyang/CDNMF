The production efficiency of the collect-and-place (CAP) surface-mount technology machine is critical to the electronic manufacturing. This paper is motivated by an optimization project cooperated with a spin-head gantry-type CAP machine manufacturer. To minimize the CAP cost;  this paper proposed a clustering-based heuristic;  named average Chebyshev linkage directed search (ACLDS);  to optimize the nozzle assignment;  feeder assignment;  and CAP sequence. Based on the experimental results;  the single-solution-based ACLDS outperforms other population-based heuristics;  for instance;  genetic algorithm;  in terms of the solution quality and computational expense. Because the number of nozzle types is typically no more than five in high-speed machines;  the enumeration method can be applied to obtain the optimal nozzle assignment in the ACLDS;  which has been proven to be significant for the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) optimization. The proposed heuristic can be applied to both the rotary-head and revolver-head gantry-type CAP machines. It can be extended to solve the optimization problems of dual-gantry operation or line balance in the PCBA. This paper assumes the mass production situation in the PCBA;  which is not suitable for high-mix and low-volume situations.
