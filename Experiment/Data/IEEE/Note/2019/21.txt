This paper is motivated by the lackof effective automatic sweep scan path planning methods forarbitrary free-form surfaces. Although there is a rich body offive-axis CMM path planning methods for inspection of free-formsurfaces, they are mainly designed for the traditional inspectionmode, i.e., the point-by-point measurement. Compared with thetraditional discrete way of CMM inspection, sweep scan has aquite different inspection mode, which tremendously boosts theinspection efficiency by maintaining the constant contact betweenthe stylus and the surface to inspect. The traditional five-axisinspection path planning methods are no longer applicable tosweep scan. Up to date, only a very handful few of automaticsweep scan path planning methods are reported and they seemto be very difficult to implement and no optimality of inspectionefficiency is discussed. We present a practical algorithm forautomatic generation of sweep scan paths for inspection of anarbitrary free-form surface. The algorithm is novel in that,by considering both the surface shape and the unique kinematiccharacteristics of a typical five-axis inspection machine, it tries to globally minimize the total inspection time. In our experiments,the sweep scan paths, generated by the proposed method, arefound to outperform that of some traditional simple sweepscan path generation methods such as the zigzag method bya large margin in terms of total inspection time (while the dataacquisition accuracy is maintained at the same level). The methodis particularly suitable for those industrial parts that are largebut relatively smooth, such as windmill blades and automobilepanels.
