This paper is motivated by the problem of matching measured points with a design model to automate manufacturing processes such as geometric inspection;  workpiece localization;  and allowance distribution. Measured points are obtained by applying a scanning device where measuring defects usually appear. Existing matching methods suffer from the drawback that the measured points may incline toward dense data and become trapped in a local optimum;  due to measuring defects. To address this practical issue;  this paper proposes a new method called variance-minimization matching (VMM);  in which the objective function is optimized to weaken the effect of measuring defects. By examining the differences between VMM and existing methods;  it is found that VMM can achieve quadratic convergence speed. Most importantly;  the method is insensitive to uneven/open point distributions. In summary: 1) this method allows us to improve the matching accuracy in the presence of measuring defects; 2) there is no need to obtain a high-quality scan of the entire workpiece;  potentially reducing scanning difficulty and improving scanning efficiency; and 3) the requirement of uniform sampling for measured points is reduced.
