The design of heading guidance laws and path-following control laws for path following of USVs subject to unknown dynamics and external disturbances is a critical problem;  which affects the development of USVs. This problem associated with practical engineering of USVs due to the actual navigation environment that is complex;  diversified;  and highly unstructured. This paper presents a wholly tight strategy to compensate for unknown sideslip angles and approximate lumped unknown dynamics. Hence;  an effective scheme being denoted FPISAN mentioned above is developed for path following of USVs.
