Microinjection process is a complex task to perform. As the advance progress of high-performance microforce sensors;  force-assisted robotic cell injection has been a hot topic in recent years. This paper presents the state-of-the-art survey of recent developments on microforce sensing for robotic cell microinjection to address the research challenges. Based on microforce sensing and control;  microinjection of both adherent and suspended cells can benefit from the force-assisted robotic cell injection process. The main challenges and promising solutions in terms of micromanipulator design;  injection control design;  cell holder design;  penetration scheme design;  injecting pipette maintenance;  injection volume;  cost reduction;  and microforce sensor calibration issues have been discussed. The related research trends are summarized.
