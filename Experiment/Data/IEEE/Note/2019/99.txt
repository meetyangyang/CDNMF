In machining applications;  the contouring error is a crucial index with respect to the surface quality of machined parts. In this paper;  a novel task coordinate frame (nTCF) is proposed to deal with the 3-D contouring control issue. By transforming the system dynamics from the world Cartesian coordinate frame to nTCF in real-time control;  a 3-D contouring control problem is locally reduced and transformed into a 2-D error dynamics regulation problem. In the nTCF;  the contouring performance and advancing performance can be decoupled and separately regulated by only two parameters in 3-D contouring control applications. The contouring error can be directly controlled. Moreover;  existing contouring error calculation (estimation) techniques;  such as linear approximation;  circular approximation;  or analytical methods;  can be readily integrated into the nTCF-based approach. Both analysis and experiments show that the nTCF-based approach is effective and much simpler in parameter tuning for 3-D contouring control.
