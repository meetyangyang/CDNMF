This paper was motivated by the problem of lower exoskeleton when it interacts with different pilots.In both military and industrial applications of lower exoskeletonfor strength augmentation, a most challenge problem is howto deal with the pHRI caused by different pilots. This papersuggests a new learning-based strategy, which modeled thepilot’s motion with movement primitives and update through thepHRI between the pilot and the lower exoskeleton with online reinforcement learning method. In order to employ the proposedCCP into the real-time application, we also combine the CCPwith a hierarchical control framework, and applied on a lowerexoskeleton system which we built for strength augmentationapplication (which named as HUALEX). In the experiments ofthis paper, we validate the proposed CCP on different pilotswith HUALEX system, the proposed CCP also achieve a goodperformance on the online learning and adaptation of the pilot’sgait. In the future, we will extend this algorithm for adaptingcomplex environment in both industrial and military applications,such as in different terrains, stairs, and slopes scenarios, and soon.
