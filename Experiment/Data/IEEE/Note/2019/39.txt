The resource-management problemaddressed in this paper is applicable to scenarios wherein afleet of vehicles visits a set of locations at predetermined timesto provide services while carrying out other tasks in-between.Such time-phased applications include the deployment of sensornetworks for wilderness search and rescue or wildfire monitoring,patient transportation services that can handle emergencies, andcourier services that can cope with urgent express requests. Theprimary inputs to the proposed vehicle-routing algorithm are:1) the physical characteristics of the vehicles (i.e., speed, capacity,and operation time limit) and 2) a service plan (i.e., servicelocations and corresponding exact service times). The algorithmyields best possible routes (a string of assigned service locations)for all the vehicles, by maximizing spare time between deliveries(within a reasonable computation time). The method also allowsfor changes in service plan in real time.
