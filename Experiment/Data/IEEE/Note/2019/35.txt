This research of developing a new softacting and noncontact gripper was motivated by the problemof gripping of fragile workpieces like ultrathin wafers. Thetraditional contact handling method often leads to defectiveproducts including cracks, contact contamination, or mechanicalwears, and the existing Bernoulli gripper has the shortcoming ofresulting in large deformation as the impact of center negativepressure force, and the collision of wafer onto the gripper asthe sharp lifting force curve. In this paper, we propose a softacting and noncontact gripper for ultrathin wafer based on thedistributed Bernoulli principle. A systematic approach whichconsists of modeling, measurement, and evaluation is providedfor the gripping techniques. We present three performanceindices for evaluating the characteristics of soft gripping, and experimentally study the effect of supply flow rate and the gapheight on the performance of deformation, vibration, and stressin the thin and fragile wafers. It is found that an optimal valueexists. We then verify the merit in gripping ultrathin waferssoftly with a small deformation or stress via comparison withtwo Bernoulli grippers and a combined gripper. The new gripperplays an important role in handling thin and fragile materials.
