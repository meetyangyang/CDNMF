This paper is motivated by the requirement of effective control methods for tower cranes. Tower cranes are widely applied in modern construction sites to fulfill cargo transportation tasks. For such systems, the jib slew motion not only enlarges the workspace but also brings more difficulties to suppress unexpected cargo swing during the transportation process. Up until now, most existing methods use simplified system models or need exact model knowledge, which are difficult to reflect real dynamics in many practical situations. To handle these existing problems, in this paper, a novel feedback control approach embedded with an elaborately constructed integral term is presented without model linearization. By introducing the integral term, even when frictions are inaccurately compensated, steady errors can be reduced effectively and, hence, the positioning accuracy can be improved. Also, the proposed controller can handle parametric uncertainties. By applying the proposed controller, the closed-loop system achieves asymptotic results, which is rigorously proven theoretically. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by implementing several groups of hardware experiments. In the future studies, we will apply the proposed method in practical applications.
