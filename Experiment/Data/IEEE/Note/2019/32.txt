Optical tracking system (OTS) forimage-guided surgery has suffered from line-of-sight (LoS) occlusion and field-of-view (FoV) limitation problems for a long time;nevertheless, no satisfactory solution has been given yet. In thereal-world practice, surgeons and assistants have to manuallyadjust the position and orientation of the optical tracker duringoperation. This interrupts the surgery process and degradesthe efficiency of the surgical procedure. Instead of using onetracker for the image-guided surgery, our approach is to utilizedistributed modular trackers to avoid LoS occlusion and maintainFoV of the OTS. Based on our previous work, this paper is toprovide an optimal fusion algorithm that takes the advantageof the multiple modules and validate the system in both thesimulation and the real-world surgical environment.
