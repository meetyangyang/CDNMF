Virtual cellular manufacturing systems can create an expectation of improving machine utilization and productivity;  reducing reconfiguration cost;  and adaptation to product specification changes in reality. However;  managers often feel difficult to make appropriate decisions for three interrelated issues;  i.e.;  workstation grouping;  virtual cell creation and release;  and energy consumption options. Workstation grouping depends on the availability of machines and workers;  and the availability may be related to the creation and release time of some virtual cells. Whether a virtual cell is created in time has an influence on the selection of energy consumption levels;  because managers need to consider both backorder cost and energy consumption cost. In addition;  there often exists a bottleneck workstation in each virtual cell. Therefore;  it is essential and worthwhile to select appropriate energy consumption levels of machines to smooth the production efficiency of grouped workstations. To effectively address the issues;  this paper presents an integrated virtual reconfiguration model. A novel Discrete Imperialist Competitive Algorithm with a Priority rule-based heuristic is developed to minimize the total operational cost. Numerical experiments and t-test results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms two commonly used ones;  i.e.;  genetic algorithm and simulated annealing in solution quality. It is suitable for virtual reconfiguration problem with industrial size in practice.
