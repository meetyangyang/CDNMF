This paper is motivated by the problem of manipulation of flexible objects. It is difficult for conventional manipulators to handle flexible objects;  such as droplets;  because their shapes dynamically deform while being handled. We considered that a flexible system should be able to conform to the object shape. Therefore;  we investigate the possible use of a ferrofluid as an actuating component because of its fluidity and peculiar characteristics. A ferrofluid has the characteristics of a fluid and magnetic material; therefore;  the fluid gathers around the source of a magnetic field and applies force to an object on it. In this paper;  we verify the characteristics of the proposed system as well as the object manipulation. Through characteristic verification;  the behavior of our system can be modeled;  and the method of object transportation can be systematized.
