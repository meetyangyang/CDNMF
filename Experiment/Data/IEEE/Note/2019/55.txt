Layout design of hospital departmentsis significant in enhancing service quality and reducing patients’travel distance. A real-world department layout problem isdifficult to solve since many factors need to be considered andmultiple optimization objectives must be sought. This paperpresents a multiobjective tabu search approach for such aproblem with both objectives to minimize patients’ flow costand departments’ closeness. This approach is able to provide multiple Pareto solutions (layouts) for decision makers to choosebased on their preferences. Layouts created by this approachcan significantly reduce patients’ travel time (distance) whilesatisfying the closeness requirement of departments.
