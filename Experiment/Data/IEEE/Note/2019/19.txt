ICP is commonly used to align different data to a same coordination system. While NSS is often used to speed up the alignment process by down-sampling the data uniformly in the normal space. The implementation of NSS only has three steps: 1) construct a set of buckets in the normal-space; 2) put all points of the data into buckets based on their normal direction; and 3) uniformly pick points from all the buckets until the desired number of points is selected. The algorithm is simple and fast;  so that it is still the common practice. However;  the weakness of NSS comes from the reason that it cannot handle rotational uncertainties. In this paper;  a new algorithm called DNSS is developed to constrain both translation and rotation at the same time by introducing a dual-normal space. With a new definition of the normal space;  the algorithm complexity of DNSS is the same as that of NSS;  and it can be readily implemented in all types of application that are currently using ICP. The experimental results show that DNSS has better efficiency;  quality;  and reliability than both normal-based and feature-based methods have.
