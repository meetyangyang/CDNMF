The research in this paper is motivatedby the following practical problem. Manipulators on industriallines can complete high accuracy tasks with hand-crafting features of objects. The perception is only used for object detectionand localization. It is not flexible since the prior knowledgediffers from tasks, which takes a long time to deploy in anew task. Besides, only well-trained experts are qualified tocomplete the deployment process. Our grasp method uses aconvolutional network to estimate the motion for manipulatordirectly from images. The camera is mounted on the manipulatorand can perceive the object actively. The training data set of thenetwork is specific for different objects that can be automaticallycollected with a few human interventions. Our method simplifiesthe deployment process and can be applied in 3C industry(computers, communications, and consumer electronics) wherethe products upgrade frequently
