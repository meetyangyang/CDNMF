This paper is motivated by the problem of an automated assembly of small screws, one of the most challenging problems in a smartphone assembly. It represents a rigorous review of robotic screwdriving literature to identify the state-of-the-art and open problems. The review material was targeted toward engineers working on related problems with the sponsor and has proved useful to them. To benefit researchers in the field of robotic and automated assembly, we have compiled the review material in the form of a survey paper. This paper covers theoretical fundamentals, tools, control and failure detection strategies, industrial applications, and open problems for robotic screwdriving. It provides a foundation for readers to familiarize themselves with the state of the art and conduct further research on this thread.
