This paper addresses possible challenges for future generations of adaptive embedded systems. It proposes an original methodology for an efficient reconfigurable hardware system (RHS) hardware test. The main objective is to significantly reduce time and cost needed for the testing process. For an RHS;  the number of stuck-at faults can be very large;  which can cause a major slowdown in the hardware test. Based on the inter-circuits relations existing between the different circuits composing an RHS;  the proposed methodology decreases considerably not only the number of the faults but also the test patterns needed for testing. The application of the generated test patterns is typically sufficient to provide an overall fault coverage. The proposed methodology is implemented in a new visual software environment named TnTest;  which is capable of providing the smallest fault set as well as the efficient test set that can be effectively used for testing. This environment can be applied to test any embedded device that can be deployed in any new application based on flexible technologies. It can also be useful in manufacturing industries for a required improvement of the production process in relation to time and cost.
