Measuring defects usually occur when using a scanning device to obtain the measured points of a workpiece. Weakening the effect of measuring defects on matching results is critical to promoting manufacturing automation. This paper proposes a new method called variance-minimization matching (VMM) that considers measuring defects. In the first part of this paper;  the modeling and theoretical analysis of VMM were introduced. In the second part of this paper;  simulated experiments are performed to verify the feasibility of VMM in addressing uneven/open point distributions;  measuring noise;  and large initial positions. Next;  artificial experiments employing VMM in geometric inspection and allowance distribution are presented. The proposed method also applies to other automated manufacturing processes;  such as workpiece localization;  deformation analysis;  and complex parts repair.
