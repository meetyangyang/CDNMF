With the fast development of softrobotics, the increasing number of soft robotic manipulators showgreat potentials of application in industries such as agriculture,biomedicine, home automation, manufacturing, logistics, anddomestic service. Thanks to the mechanical compliance, softmanipulators demonstrate environmental adaptability at the costof very precise positioning. However, the guaranteed boundsof the reaching range are valuable in order to provide usersa good knowledge of the product performance, which is themotivation of this paper. This paper provides not only a methodand framework based on interval analysis to evaluate the poseof soft actuators, but also a case study of uncertainty intervalcharacterization procedure which is domain-specific for softactuators. The presented method framework can be implementedfor continuum manipulators and soft actuators as well as anyother robotic devices featured by such flexible components.
