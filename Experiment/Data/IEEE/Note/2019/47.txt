Fault diagnosis based on process data models always focused on analyzing variables' contributions to the anomaly in the past practice. But it is frequently difficult to decide the root causes just using the variables' contributions because different faults may induce a similar variation of the same variable. This paper provides a new scheme to locate the faulty components;  including the sensor faults;  actuator faults;  process faults;  and disturbance variations. It is more pertinent to learn about the fault locations than variables' contributions. Moreover;  by locating faults first and then figuring out variables' contributions to a specific location;  more detailed and precise diagnosis conclusions can be drawn when being compared with the results of using the variables' contributions in a global system. This new method is purely data driven and it has no demand for complex process knowledge.
