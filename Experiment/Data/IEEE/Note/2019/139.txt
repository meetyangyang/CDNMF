/i>\nâ€”DES is a collection of many contemporary computer-integrated industrial and social service systems. For the sake of technology or cost considerations;  the occurrences of some events are not fully observed;  rendering the supervisory control algorithmically complicated and exacerbating the originally notorious state explosion problem. This paper aims to ameliorate the state explosion problem using a novel formalism;  namely;  state-tree structures;  that can be applied to real-world systems thanks to the computational efficiency that is demonstrated by an industrial system. Compared with the traditional SCT of DES;  the significance of the proposed methodology will intrigue academic researchers and industrial practitioners.
