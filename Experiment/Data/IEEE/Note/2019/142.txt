This paper is motivated by the process cycles in multiproduction factories (or lines) of baker production, surgery scheduling, and parallel computer systems. In these process cycles, jobs are assigned to multiproduction factories (or lines), and no interruption exists between consecutive operations. This paper models this process as a multiobjective distributed no-wait flow-shop scheduling with SDST. Scheduling becomes more challenging when facing distributed factories. This paper provides an estimation of distributed algorithm with Pareto dominate concept which uses a probabilistic model to generate offspring. Experiment results suggest that the proposed algorithm can find superior solutions of large-scale instances. This scheduling model can be extended to practical problems by considering other constraints, such as assembly process, mixed no-wait, and transporting times. Besides, the proposed algorithm can be applied to solve other distributed scheduling problems and industrial cases, once their constraints are known, i.e., the processing time of operations, the setup time of machines.
