This paper proposes a framework formodeling and predicting the degradation level and/or conditionof units with time. Our framework is particularly useful wheremany units have missing and/or limited degradation observations. Essentially, our proposed method integrates two importantideas: 1) leveraging the available data from the unit of interestto improve the modeling fitting of the individual unit overthe observed time domain and 2) considering the relationshipbetween the available units to extract proper and accuratepopulation characteristics to address the challenge of limitedobservations. The proposed approach is validated via simulationstudies as well as a healthcare case study based on AD. In thefuture research, we will further explore the extension of theproposed method such as considering more generic degradationmodels and optimal parameter tunings.
