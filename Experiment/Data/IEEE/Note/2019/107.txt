The stability of a discrete event system (DES) is a property that guarantees that the DES will return to the normal operation behavior after a disturbance deviates the system from such a behavior. This is a key property that a controlled DES must fulfill. The algorithms proposed in this paper allow determining efficiently the stability of concurrent DES by analyzing the Petri net structure.
