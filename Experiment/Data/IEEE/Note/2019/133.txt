The motivation of this paper is to devise a compact flexure-based stage, which can be mounted on the top of an XY stage for constructing a hybrid type of XYZ stage dedicated to micro/nanopositioning applications. Such a design scheme provides a more flexible solution than serial- and parallel-kinematic designs. In order to fulfill the design requirement and to improve the compactness and output directionality of the stage, a series of design processes is conducted. The design parameters are optimized and the optimal design leads to the stage dimension of 58 mm × 20 mm × 15.5 mm (length × width × height), which offers a motion range of 97.32 µm as verified by the experimental study. In consideration of the motion range and physical size, the proposed stage offers a more compact structure than available designs. Experimental results demonstrate the fine performance of the developed prototype stage for vertical micro/nanopositioning.
