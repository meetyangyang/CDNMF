This paper was motivated by the problem of proposing a transferable framework dedicated to real-timemultiaxis and multirobot control. Most of the existing middlewaresolutions do not unify accesses to the axis level and to therobot control level with a common programming approach andwith real-time capability. This is a key problem for achievingmultirobot synchronization and reaction times compatible withdynamic collaboration. Our framework is based on open roboticsand object-oriented programming and implements the industrialstandards for motion control. Multirobots control experimentswith a high number of synchronized axis and heterogeneoushardware demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.
