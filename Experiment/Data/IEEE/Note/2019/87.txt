This paper is motivated by the efficientexploration problem, which plays a key role in various areassuch as the information gathering and environment monitoring.In these applications, the mission length and executing time are often restricted by the battery capacity of the robot. In this paper,an efficient path planning framework is introduced to reduce thepath length and exploration time. The robot keeps a road mapof the environment to facilitate the path planning. The proposedtarget selection mechanism helps the robot determine the nextbest target to explore. Furthermore, the proposed trajectoryoptimization algorithm helps in reducing the path cost. Overall,this framework enables efficiently and autonomously explorationwith a novel path planning framework.
