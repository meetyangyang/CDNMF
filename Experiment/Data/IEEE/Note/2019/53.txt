For reconfigurable distributed controlsystems, two models are indispensable: a control model thatdefines the hardware and software behaviors and a reconfiguration model that manages unpredictable changes in the relatedenvironment for configuring accordingly the system behavior.The proposed RFB approach is based on hierarchical state chartspecification within function blocks, its automatic conversion toa reconfigurable Petri net GR-TNCES, which models all possiblereconfiguration scenarios and a probabilistic model checkingfor qualitative and quantitative analysis. The system flexibility is ensured by a decision algorithm and a reconfigurationmatrix which selects dynamically the right scenario to execute.The approach is supported by ZiZo tool chain which createsand edits reconfigurable function blocks model and convertsit automatically to GR-TNCES, and then to specific PRISMmodels. The detection of the worst cases before deployment is amajor virtue of the approach that practitioners need to estimateand enhance the design process. Several properties are easilychecked and estimated such as system feasibility before and afterreconfiguration, deadlock detection, confluence, estimation of thereconfiguration failure, system availability, and best repair time.The developed software package can be applied in any domainrequiring flexibility and failure estimation, such as new medicaltechnologies, transportation systems, smart and microgirds, andmanufacturing systems.
