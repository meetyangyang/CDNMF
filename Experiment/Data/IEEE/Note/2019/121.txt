When the Global Positioning System is not available or reliable, visual odometry (VO) on ground vehicles is an efficient tool for estimating the pose, which involves translation and rotation. However, VO inherently suffers from drifting issue due to constant iterations. By adding a low-cost heading reference sensor, this paper first introduces graph optimization formulation of pose estimation and then presents a pose estimation framework which incorporates heading measurements to VO such that long-term translation and rotation estimation errors can be greatly reduced in real-time computation. As a supplementary to VO, performance may still deteriorate in environments with poor illumination conditions and high-frequency movements. The proposed approach may be further improved by fusing heading measurements from more sensors or being used to build a heading reference-assisted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system on any off-the-shelf SLAM framework.
