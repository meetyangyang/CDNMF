The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical control strategy for the leader-following formation of multiple autonomous mobile robots subjected to nonholonomic constraints. In most of the existing leader-following formation control schemes for nonholonomic mobile robots, having access to the full state of the leader is a requirement. However, due to limitations in communication bandwidth and range, it is reasonable to assume that the information of the leader is available only to a subset of followers. Hence, this paper suggests a new distributed leader-following formation control strategy based on the distributed estimation of the leaderâ€™s states. Moreover, the coordination error between a pair of interacting robots is explicitly used in the control design to weaken the dependence on the estimated state of the leader, and enhance the decentralized nature of the proposed control scheme. The stability and convergence of the system are analyzed mathematically and the experiment using unicycles provides promising results. In ongoing research, we are addressing the issues of collision avoidance and communication delays to provide more realistic setup for the industrial applications of multivehicle systems.
