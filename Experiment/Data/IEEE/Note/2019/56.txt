In primary care clinics, care deliveryactivities are carried out by a team of care providers and supportstaff, such as physicians, nurses, and medical assistants. An activity or a task may need to be carried out by more than one teammember multiple times. Thus, communication and collaboration between team members are critical to ensure safety and highquality of care services. Modeling, analysis, and improvementin the team communication and collaboration process are ofsignificant importance. Although numerous studies have beenfound regarding team communication and collaboration issues,quantitative and analytical models to address the efficiency ofsuch processes are not available. The goal of this paper isto present an analytical framework using queueing networkmodels. Using this framework, the efficiency of the process can beevaluated and system properties can be investigated. In addition,the most critical constraints, i.e., bottlenecks, can be identifiedto improve process performance.
