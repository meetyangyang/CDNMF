This paper is motivated by the scheduling issues of cluster tools with chamber cleaning requirements.Though an efficient scheduling method for single-armed clustertools is presented by Yu et al., its performance is not sufficientlyclose to the optimal when a dual-armed robot is considered. Morespecifically, we cannot expect any productivity improvement fromadopting a dual-armed robot, although it allows more flexibletool operations and is known to have higher throughput than asingle-armed robot. Thus, we propose a novel scheduling methodfor dual-armed cluster tools that require chamber cleaningoperations. The experimental results show that the suggestedmethod achieves optimal tool throughput in most of the practicaltool conditions.
