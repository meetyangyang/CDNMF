This paper is motivated by planning optimized trajectories for the mobile service robots in dynamic environments with pedestrians. In this area;  the sampling-based motion planning algorithms have been widely used for their high efficiency and robustness. However;  the real-time optimality of the motion planning cannot be guaranteed due to the challenges caused by the moving pedestrians. In this paper;  we propose a dual-tree framework to solve this problem. First;  a classic Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) is constructed to generate a heuristic trajectory. Then;  instead of reconnecting the nodes on the heuristic trajectory directly;  a rewired tree is built to optimize the heuristic trajectory. This proposed dual-tree framework can fully exploit the information of the RRT tree and ensure the completeness of the motion planning. The proposed motion planning algorithm also considers the constraints of the nonholonomic mobile robots;  and it can be applied in most mobile service robots to improve their motion planning quality.
