This paper is motivated by the practical issue of degradation modeling and prognostics when multiple sensors simultaneously monitor the degradation status of a unit. Specifically, there are two fundamental questions involved, including: 1) how to screen out noninformative sensors and 2) how to properly combine the information from the selected sensor signals to accurately estimate the underlying degradation status of the unit. The novelty of this paper lies in developing an innovative latent model that tackles these two challenging questions in an integrated manner. There are four main steps involved when implementing the proposed method: 1) collecting multiple sensor signals and failure time of historical units; 2) selecting the informative sensors and deriving the optimal weight for each selected sensor; 3) constructing the health indices (HIs) of in-service units; and 4) predicting the remaining useful life of the in-service units using the constructed HIs. The proposed method is very useful when the degradation is under a single failure mode in a single environmental condition. In the future research, we will study the extension of the proposed model when sensor signals have a nonlinear relationship, as well as when the degradation process is under more complex scenarios such as multiple failure modes and multiple operation conditions.
