The novel modeling method developedin this paper employs both physics-based analysis (e.g., web handling system dynamics) and regression methods [e.g., censoredregression and linear/logistic regression (LG)] using multisensorsignals. The estimation results from the model can serve asvirtual sensing and virtual metrology tools to increase the systemvisibility and be applied for process monitoring and errordetection in real time. A print registration unit of elastic filmin a roll-to-roll system is employed to demonstrate and validatethe proposed modeling method in terms of the accuracy ofstate estimates and quality prediction. Based on the comparisonresults, the hybrid modeling method shows higher accuracy instate estimation and quality prediction than do the models withdata-driven methods only.
