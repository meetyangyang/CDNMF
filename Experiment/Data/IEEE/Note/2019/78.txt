The algorithm of estimating the cameramotion from a set of moving camera frames/images is commonlycalled VO. This problem has many applications ranging frombuilding a 3-D map of the scene for the robot to navigate, grasp,and so on. Any VO algorithm must be fast, robust, and withlow drift (low accumulation in error). These desired functionsare generally obtained by selecting “good” features in an image, which, in the computer vision sense, turns out to be “corners.”However, when we constrain the setting to an indoor scene witha lot of clutter, we have a lot of objects which can be usedto obtain “good” features from both a computer vision senseand a conceptual sense. We use this philosophy and presenta preprocessing method to select better features as comparedto a traditional VO pipeline using only geometric features andimprove the robustness of the state-of-the-art VO method: directsparse odometry, obtaining more accurate and robust results evenwith the lesser number of features. We evaluate our methodson three different data sets: ICL-NUIM, TUM monoVO, andCVL-UMD. We collected a custom dataset we call CVL-UMD todemonstrate the robustness of our approach, namely, SalientDSOin cluttered indoor scenes.
