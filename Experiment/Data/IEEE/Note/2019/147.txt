 FDD is of great importance for saving energy and improving occupancy comfort levels and building safety levels. Identifying unseen faults in real application is challenging since: 1) building faults are complicated and confusing while well-labeled fault data is rare; 2) experimental fault data collected in laboratory test beds cannot be directly used as judgment criteria for real buildings; and 3) it is impossible to measure every possible fault ahead of time. Although supervised learning methods have been successfully applied in existing works to solve the building FDD;  they could not attack the UFI problem. In this paper;  a novel EK-UFI method is proposed to identify unseen faults by employing the similarities between known faults and unknown faults. Experimental results show that the proposed method is essential.
