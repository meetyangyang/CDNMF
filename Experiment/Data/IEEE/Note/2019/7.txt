This paper is motivated by enhancingthe efficiency of OTs by sharing the surgery capacity between theelective and emergency surgeries. More specifically, we considerthe problem of inserting nonelective surgeries of different emergency levels in the execution of a given elective surgery schedule.An SO approach is proposed to dynamically prioritize emergencyand elective surgeries in order to best balance meeting emergencysurgery requirement, perturbation of elective schedule, andsurgery team overtime. Numerical experiments based on the datacollected from Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris show the significant benefit of efficient emergency insertion over the currenthospital practice. Elective surgery schedule is shown to have themost important impact on the system performance but efficientemergency insertion always adds significant improvement.
