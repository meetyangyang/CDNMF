This paper aims at addressing thechallenge of recommending physicians to patients on web-basedappointment systems, so as to achieve efficient and effective utilization of physician resources. Currently, the recommendationsare delivered manually by a huge number of general practitionershired by the platforms based on their expertise and experiences. Upon each arrival of patient, they upload symptom statementsof their own illness, and then, general practitioners will give ascore or a rating on how well these patients are matched tophysicians on the basis of symptom descriptions. With the development of artificial intelligence and information technology, theseworks might be done efficiently and effectively by algorithmsautomatically. To accomplish that, challenges will be presented:1) physicians with adequate expertise might conflict with patientpreferences, i.e., patients have strong preference toward seniorspecialists but their illness should be taken care of by a juniorphysician. This conflict indicates the importance of capturingpatient preferences and choices in web-based appointment systemoperations and 2) the lack of patient preferences informationmakes the problem even harder. For newly developed webbased system, there are no available historical data to infer thepreference parameters. On the other hand, the historical data inthe web-based appointment system might not be able to revealfull information on patient preferences, because the system didnot conduct effective and comprehensive explorations over allpossible operations in the past. We capture the heterogeneousillness conditions in terms of rewards to imply the potentialhealth improvement of patients. This paper assumes completeinformation of patient illness descriptions, and therefore, we focuson the operations management of appointment system, i.e., howto deliver the optimized physician assortment.
