This paper was motivated by the motionplanning problem for mobile robots in complex indoor environments. Existing approaches generally implement a two-levelplanning scheme, namely, global path planning and local trajectory planning. This paper proposes a novel multilevel humanlikemotion planning approach, which is able to guarantee efficiency,smoothness, foreseeability, and flexibility in the presence ofkinematic and environmental constraints. Experimental resultsshow that autonomous navigation with the proposed approach isrealized in large-scale, dynamic, partially unknown, and unstructured indoor environments, but human motion prediction has notyet been incorporated. In the future research, we will concentrateon humanâ€“robot interaction and environment-adaptive planning.
