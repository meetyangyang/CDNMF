Collaborative robots promise many advantages on the shop and factory floor, including low-cost automation and flexibility in small-batch production. Using this technology requires engineers to redesign tasks that are currently performed by human workers to effectively involve human and robot workers. However, existing quantitative methods for scheduling and allocating tasks to multiple workers do not consider factors, such as differences in skill between human and robot workers or the differential ergonomic impact of tasks on workers. We propose a method to analyze how the inclusion of a collaborative robot in an existing process might affect the makespan of the task and the physical strain the task places on the human worker. The method enables the engineer to prioritize and weigh makespan and worker ergonomics in creating schedules and inspect the resulting task schedules. Using this method, engineers can determine how the addition of a collaborative robot might improve makespan and/or reduce job risk and potential for occupational hazard for human workers, particularly in tasks that involve high physical strain. We apply our method to six real-world tasks from various industries to demonstrate its use and discuss its practical limitations. In our future work, we plan to develop a software tool that will assist engineers in the use of our method.
