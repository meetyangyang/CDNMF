This paper is motivated by thechallenges of autonomous exploration for mobile robots. We suggest a novel autonomous exploration approach through directional endpoint feature-based graph simultaneous localizationand mapping (SLAM) and polygon map construction. Thisnewly proposed approach does not require any artificial landmark or underlying occupancy grid map, which is easy to implement. The experiments are carried out in the office and hallwayenvironments, including graph-based SLAM and autonomousexploration for mobile robots. The experimental results show theeffectiveness of the proposed autonomous exploration framework.In the future research, we will address autonomous explorationin more challenging dynamic environments.
