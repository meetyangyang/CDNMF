This paper is motivated by the issue of controlling a four- degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) offshore ship-mounted tower crane system under the effects of unknown external disturbances. In practical applications;  the persistent disturbances caused by sea waves or currents can always happen and make the offshore crane operation very challenging. Moreover;  it brings more difficulties in the controller design for such a system due to its nonlinear underactuated property. Existing control approaches for offshore cranes are developed based upon linearized or oversimplified crane models or require exact model knowledge;  and they may not work well in the presence of harsh sea conditions. Toward this end;  this paper suggests a new control approach for 4-DOF offshore tower cranes suffering from sea wave effects to achieve a satisfactory performance. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point is derived;  implying that the accurate jib/trolley positioning and fast payload swings suppression against complex unknown external disturbances are achieved simultaneously. Preliminary physical experiments implemented on a self-built offshore tower crane hardware test bed verify the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed observer-based control method. In the future research;  we will apply the suggested control approach to industrial offshore crane systems to improve their working efficiency.
