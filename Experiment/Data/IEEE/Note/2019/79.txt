This paper presents a contactforce/torque controller based on a viscoelastic model, whichunifies contact perception and adaptive reaction. Using theviscoelastic model, we get the relationship between the endposition/posture and the first-order differential of the contactforce/torque, from which a state equation can be established and used to design a state feedback controller. Combining with bodystabilization, we adopt this controller to modify the trajectoryof both landing and support feet simultaneously for humanoidrobots to realize stable bipedal walking on indefinite uneventerrain, which is validated in both simulations and experimentson the BHR-6P humanoid robot. In addition, this method canbe employed for other robots or equipment when the contactforce/torque control is needed; e.g., industry manipulators andquadruped robots.
