For nonlinear characteristics beingbetween the independent variables and the dependent variables,this paper proposes the reinforced nonlinear model with updatedriven for gas component perception. Based on the measured absorption spectra, the proposed method can deal with thenonlinearity more effective due to the use of neural networks. Theupdate-driven strategy is adopted for modifying model withoutusing the old data, namely, the new collected data are combinedwith loading matrices of the old model to update model. Theproposed method can improve the performance of the componentprediction for the gas sensing system, which is usually equippedfor the olfactory perception of robot. Moreover, the proposedmethod can support engineers to focus on any interest analytebased on the actual requirements, and the proposed methodwould be developed for multicomponent analysis.
