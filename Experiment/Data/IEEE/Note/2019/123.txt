This paper was motivated by the limitation of current distributed task allocation algorithms as they cannot achieve performances that are as good as the centralized ones. Therefore;  a centralized algorithm is designed to evaluate the performance gap between the state-of-the-art distributed and centralized approaches. In the future research section;  a new distributed particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed based on this paper as the research has shown that the proposed centralized PSO algorithm delivers the best results so it is potentially a strong candidate for adaptation.
