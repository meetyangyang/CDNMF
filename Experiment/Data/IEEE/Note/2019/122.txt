The method described in this paper can be used to obtain knowledge or patterns of the environment based on the trajectories generated by the human operators/demonstrators and utilize the obtained knowledge or patterns for improving the performance of the future operators. The obtained information is the logical statements about the waypoints or subgoals to be reached, and obstacles or dangerous regions to be avoided during certain time intervals, when the environment satisfies certain conditions also expressed in the form of logical statements. The methodology of inferring knowledge from data and designing advisory controllers for guiding or helping future practices is potentially useful in many applications where the dynamic mathematical model of the external environment is unknown.
