High-precision control of pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) is a vital problem when PMAs are utilized as actuators of rehabilitation robots since the patient's safety and the performance of rehabilitation tasks are largely dependent on the accuracy of the actuators. Conventional model-based control approaches usually require relatively accurate identification of system parameters;  which is difficult for the PMA;  owing to its strong nonlinear and time-varying characteristics. This paper proposes a new model predictive control method based on an echo state Gaussian process that can describe the unknown dynamics of a PMA due to its universal approximation property. Through the optimization method;  the controller can be efficiently realized and presents better performances than some comparatives. By applying this approach;  it is possible to achieve not only high-precision control of PMAs but also a certain degree of robustness to the load.
