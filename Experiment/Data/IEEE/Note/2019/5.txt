The ambulatory care delivery system isplagued by delays that dissatisfy patients, physicians, and othermedical staff, and adversely affect patient outcomes. Whilemany extant industrial engineering/operations research (IE/OR)articles focus on reducing physician appointmentdelays or waiting times during visits to a medical office,this paper seeks to address the lag between primary care visitsand specialty care visits, i.e., the waiting for access to specialtycare once the primary care physician has decided to refer thepatient. This paper establishes a novel analytical frameworkto model primary care to specialty care referral processeswith an emphasis on the information transition along patientpathway. The rigorous analytical model unveils the insights thatmight not be easily identified using qualitative approaches, andenjoys higher computational efficiency compared to simulationmethods. What emerges from the study is the need to integratehealth information technology into medical personnelâ€™s workflowand redesign the process to allow effective communication,which will lead to improved care, efficiency, and satisfaction.
