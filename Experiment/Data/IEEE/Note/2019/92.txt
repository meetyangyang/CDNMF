Smart home should maximize the fulfillment of personal goals that are often conflicting. For example;  it should try to fulfill as much as possible the requests made by both the mother and daughter who wants to watch TV but both having different channel preferences. That said;  every person has a set of goals or constraints that they hope the smart home can fulfill. Therefore;  human-centric system that automates the loosely coupled devices of the smart home to optimize the goals or constraints of individuals in the home is developed. Automated planning is done using converted services extracted from devices;  where conversion is done using existing tools and concepts from Web technologies. Weighted constraint satisfaction that provides the declarative approach to cover large problem domain to realize the automated planner with optimization capability is proposed. Details to speed up planning through search space reduction are also given. Real-time case studies are run in a prototype smart home to demonstrate its applicability and intelligence;  where every planning is performed under a maximum of 10 s. The vision of this paper is to be able to implement such system in a community;  where devices everywhere can cooperate to ensure the well-being of the community.
