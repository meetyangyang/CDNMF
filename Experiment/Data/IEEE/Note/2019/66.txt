This paper was motivated by the realindustrial needs of change point detection in torque signalsduring pipe tightening processes. Identifying the change pointsthat substantially captures the tightening process conditions,and thus assuring the quality of pipe connections, is of greatpractical interest. A key challenge to this problem is that multipleuncertainties exist in the pipe tightening process, thereby leadingto various nonlinear profiles with different lengths in torquesignal. This fact introduces a number of fake change points andconsequently mixes with the real change points regarding theprocess conditions. To address this issue, we propose to generate a“physical basis function” to adaptively assign the weights to thosenonlinear profiles that may produce the fake points, by usingdynamic time warping. To better use this method for changepoint detection, two factors should be noted: 1) the generatedbasis function should fully comply with the process physics and2) this method can be widely used in torque signals with differentlengths and multiple nonlinear profiles.
