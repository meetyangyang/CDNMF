The research in this paper is motivated by the following practical problem. Before failure events occur in a manufacturing system, can engineers predict the occurrences based on the observation record of the system? This paper aims to investigate the predictability issue of discrete-event systems under a decentralized framework by introducing the notion of copredictability. In order to verify the copredictability of systems, an approach is proposed by constructing the coverifier. In particular, the verification is polynomial-time.
