Coordination of production and inventory is crucial for system efficiency improvement. In order tobetter operate the system and respond to customer demands,this paper explores such coordination for stochastic customerorders to achieve the maximum effective throughput. Particularly, we consider the case where production is constrainedby material inventory. System bottlenecks for various cases areidentified, which can facilitate system diagnosis and performanceevaluation. Based on the bottleneck analysis, an optimizationproblem is formulated to provide the optimal throughput andpolicy. Several important practical cases are also discussed,including single product type, identical/uniform servers, andspeed-identical/uniform product types. Besides, sensitivity analysis is conducted to show how the changes of parameters suchas expected workload and server speed will affect throughputperformance. In the future research, more complex production environments and cost-related constraints will be further considered to help practitioners achieve desirable system outputs.
