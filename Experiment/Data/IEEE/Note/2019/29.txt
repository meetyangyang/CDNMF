This paper was motivated by the lackof commercial solution for the automatic cabling of switchgears.Existing approaches to this problem are in some way limitedto specific large-scale products or simple layouts. This paperinvestigated a robust and flexible solution, based on the exploitation of multiple sensors and machine learning algorithms, forwire detection, grasping, and connection. The proposed approachis characterized by simple design and self-tuning capabilities,and it can be easily employed on a wide range of switchgearlayouts thanks to the large workspace of the manipulator.Experimental results show that the proposed system is able toachieve a 95% success rate within a realistic admissible region.In the future research, we will integrate the proposed solutionwith an electromechanical component localization module anda terminal fastening system to evaluate the performance on thereal production line.
