This paper was motivated by the problem of longwall coal mining automation, especially positioning of longwall shearer, but it also applies to other mobile mining equipment. Longwall shearer positioning with an INS aided by an odometer has been regarded as an effective technological approach to longwall mining automation by coal mining workers and researchers. However, the positioning accuracy is largely subjected to the performance of the INS. This paper proposed a closing path optimal estimation model based on the motion characteristics of the shearer and a KF. Through simulation tests, it was verified that the model improved the positioning accuracy of the shearer by approximately an order of 1. This was beneficial for astricting the large positioning error of the shearer in a longwall mining face during each cutting cycle for approximately 1 h. In the future research, we will address the field tests of the closing path optimal estimation model and extending other mining applications.
