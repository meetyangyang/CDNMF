Customer order scheduling models have wide applications in industries where every single order may contain multiple product types and the entire order requires one shipment delivery. In many applications;  such as pigments dyes manufacturing;  auto repair;  and grocery;  consideration of customer orders rather than individual jobs is often preferred. Given the stochastic nature and the synchronization constraints of the problem;  a multifidelity simulation algorithm named Bound-Multi-fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling Bound-(MO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\nTOS) is proposed. Experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms three other popular simulation optimization algorithms under a variety of scenarios. It is admitted that further improvement can be made in refining the computation resource distribution process of Bound-MO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\nTOS. In the future research;  such an improvement will be more thoroughly elaborated so that practitioners can utilize it to coordinate their productions better.
