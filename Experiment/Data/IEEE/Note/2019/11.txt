This paper presents the novel optimization models to help ambulance deployment. Due to ambulanceunavailability and relocation operations, traditional optimizationformulations might not be sufficient for modeling or might behard for computation. In this paper, we provide an uncertaintyset-based approach to capture ambulance unavailability and tobuild the robust optimization models (with relocation recoursedecisions). Also, efficient algorithms are designed to supportpractical instances. Numerical results are very supportive to ournew models and computational methods.
