An appointment system with a limited booking window length is a practical solution to reduce waiting time. However;  potential patients will lose the opportunity to obtain access to healthcare systems;  especially those with a high arrival rate. To balance the tradeoff between shortening the waiting time and increasing healthcare access probability;  we attempt to evaluate and design an improved appointment rule that includes booking window length;  block capacity;  and block service time. Sensitivity analysis shows that extending the booking window does not significantly reduce system congestion;  and a narrowed appointment block is a suitable design for highly in-demand doctors. On the basis of our model;  we design an optimal appointment rule for an actual Chinese hospital. Results show that improvement can be significant (more than 60%;  for example) depending on the parameters.
