Datagram transport layer security (DTLS) is a standards-based security protocol to secure communications in an IoT environment, including home, factory, or building automation systems. However, to develop a practical security solution based on DTLS, several assumptions inherent to DTLS need to address the practical requirements of various IoT scenarios. Furthermore, some barriers associated with implementing DTLS in an IoT environment should be overcome. This paper presents an interface to extend the basic security functionalities provided by DTLS. Through the interface, a general security platform can be constructed and combined with DTLS. Hence, fine-grained access control and group security can be merged with DTLS, together with standards compliance.
