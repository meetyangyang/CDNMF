This paper is motivated by a goal to realize various home automation applications through human localization. For example, with the knowledge of human location, lighting, and air conditioning systems can be more efficiently managed, or a home service robot can provide better service to the resident. There currently lacks an accurate human localization method in indoor environments. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper aims to combine simple environmental sensors (passive infrared sensors) and a single wearable motion sensor to accurately track human locations. This method reduces the intrusiveness to the human, while keeping the cost of the infrastructure low. The theoretical framework has been tested and evaluated in a mock apartment environment as a proof of concept. For deployment into real homes, we need to conduct more realistic tests and thorough evaluation of the system. It is also necessary to reduce the size and weight of the wearable motion sensor and simplify the installation of the environmental sensors.
