To be competitive in the global market, companies must be prudent in the use of their resources. This paper considers a parallel scheduling environment where choosing in-house machines and/or subcontractors as resources to perform the orders/jobs is the main objective. Processing time (or cost) of a job to be performed by different machines or subcontractors can be different. Furthermore, if a machine or a subcontractor is chosen to perform a set of orders, there is a onetime fixed cost (in the case of subcontractor it can be considered transportation cost) that depends on the machine or subcontractor. The scheduling criteria are to choose a subset of k machines and/or subcontractors to do all orders/jobs while minimizing the sum of the total workload and total fixed costs. The complexity of the problem is discussed and shown to be NP-hard. An efficient tabu search that solves large-scale problems in fraction of a second of CPU time is presented and an extensive computational experiment is provided.
