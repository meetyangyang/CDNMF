Although the amount of discarded electronic waste in the world is rapidly increasing;  efficient methods that can handle this in an automated non-destructive fashion have not been developed. Screws are a common fastener used on electronic products;  such as laptops;  and must be removed during nondestructive methods. In this paper;  we focus on using the cognitive architecture Soar to facilitate the disassembly sequence of removing these screws from the back of laptops. Soar is able to differentiate between different models of laptops and store the locations of screws for these models leading to an improvement of the disassembly time when the same laptop model is used. Currently;  this paper only uses one of Soar's long-term memory modules (semantic memory) and a screwdriver tool. However;  this paper can be extended to use multiple tools by using different features available in Soar such as other long-term memory modules and substates.
