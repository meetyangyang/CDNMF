In a control system used for an industrial facility;  a large amount of data is collected and historized. The data include sensor measurements;  status of actuators;  alarms;  and operator actions;  and it therefore contains valuable information. The information can be extracted and utilized to assist in the improvement of the control and operation of the industrial facility. The objective of this paper is to provide decision support tools by: 1) defining operation metrics that can characterize the information extracted from the historized data; 2) presenting visualization plots that allow for a clear presentation and comparison of the metrics;  where three types of plots are proposed for different purposes of comparison; and 3) a ranking method and a reordering design procedure of displayed alarms during an alarm flood. Furthermore;  this paper discusses how the information is extracted from the historized data and how to integrate the proposed decision support tools into existing industrial automation platforms.
