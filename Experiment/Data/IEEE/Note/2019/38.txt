This paper was motivated by the problem of inserting partially flexible objects in precision assembly, but it also applies to other components with unevenlydistributed flexibilities. This approach has benefits in terms ofassembling rigid-compliant-rigid sets of the objects and modelingthe behavior of many similar objects. The following key steps arementioned to apply the proposed method. The practitioners needto first compute the insertion compliance based on the modelthat is built in this paper to relate the deformation and force.The determination of the object configuration in hybrid insertionis then demanded considering the system compliance. The finalsteps are to obtain the object states according to the force outputand efficiently plan the insertion depths considering the pastperformance, the current evaluation, and the future prediction. In future research, we will address the simultaneous assembly ofmultiple partially flexible objects.
