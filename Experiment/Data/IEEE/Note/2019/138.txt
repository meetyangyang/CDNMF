This paper was motivated by the problem of generating movements to transfer a robot from its current state to a new position and velocity at a certain time, when the target state and the final time may require correction at a high rate. For example, for picking small objects from a conveyor belt with a variable feed rate, an off-line planning would fail, since the motion has to be adjusted as soon as the speed is changed. Under the assumption that the desired pickup position and velocity and arrival time can be predicted, the approach in this paper is applicable. The movements can be optimized, for example, for energy efficiency or for reduction of vibrations in the robot. We discuss how to mathematically express the desired performance criteria and other requirements on the motion, such as not violating a maximum joint speed. Quick reactions to sensor inputs are computationally demanding. Thus, we limit ourselves to a class of motion-generation problems that lends itself to numerical optimization. Additionally, we save computation power by gradually refining the motion.
