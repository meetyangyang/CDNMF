In many contemporary applications of automation science and engineering, a number of entities—or “agents”—must be transported expediently from their initial locations to certain destinations using a set of links that define the underlying “guidepath network.” Furthermore, various safety considerations require that the agents must be adequately separated during these transports, and the imposed restrictions turn the corresponding traffic coordination problem into a complex resource allocation problem, where the contested resources are the guidepath-network links. This paper presents a set of algorithms that can provide high-quality schedules for the resulting traffic-scheduling problems in a computationally efficient manner. These properties of our algorithms are established through the necessary theoretical analysis, but they are also demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments where they are shown capable to provide near-optimal solutions for some very complex problem instances in no more than a few seconds. In addition, our algorithms are “complete,” i.e., they will always provide a feasible schedule for any instantiation of the traffic-scheduling problem considered in this paper. Hence, they can effectively address the needs for “real-time” traffic management that arise in the context of the considered applications.
