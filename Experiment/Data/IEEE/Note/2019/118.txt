Compliant, soft robotic grippers make it easier to grasp objects with various shapes and sizes; these grippers adapt to the shape of the object, which provides robustness to positioning errors and often removes the necessity to precisely plan the contact locations. These advantages make compliant grippers ideal to use in industrial settings as well as in service robotics, where the variety of object shapes and sizes are immense. On the other hand, for the tasks that require precise object manipulation (e.g., for a peg-in-hole problem), these hands are more challenging to control than their rigid counterparts: it is harder to obtain their precise models, and they often do not have enough proprioceptive sensors to calculate the full pose of the system. In this paper, we propose solutions to utilize vision feedback for positioning an object using compliant hands. These solutions do not rely on precise models of the gripper or the full knowledge of the gripper state. We adopt various control techniques to provide precise positioning in steady state as well as to maintain efficiency in the transient.
