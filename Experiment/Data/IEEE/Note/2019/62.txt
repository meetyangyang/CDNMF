The SSM aims to estimate crucial latentvariables that characterize the states of a system but cannot bemeasured routinely or directly. The conventional way has beensolely based on a measurement capacity dedicated to observedvariables. However, we realize there are situations that, althoughlatent variables cannot be measured routinely, it is possible toinspect a small portion of latent variables at a given frequency.Thus, the problem is how to allocate the inspection resourcesto help monitor the latent variables of the state-space systemoptimally, conditioning on the established statistical machineryof the SSM for model estimation and inference. We propose aDI method to select and partially measure the latent variablesand improve the estimation accuracy by combining the measuredlatent variables and observations.
