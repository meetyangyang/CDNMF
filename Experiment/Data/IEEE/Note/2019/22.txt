This paper was motivated by the challenging problem of the watch-hand alignment in the industrialproduction. Unlike the traditional manipulation, this alignmentis subjected to various disturbances from the aged equipmentand complex operating conditions, including complex forces atthe airâ€“liquid operation interface and the confusing scratches,undesired flaking particles, as well as the reflection of lightin the image. Here, we propose a microrobotic system and arobust control strategy to precisely align the watch hand and eliminate the influence from the above disturbances. In themachine vision process for recognizing the object, filtering,contour/corner detection, and template matching methods areadopted to acquire accurate position information despite theinterference in image processing. To avoid the disturbance fromthe complex forces during the alignment, we develop the robustsliding mode controller to guarantee the alignment precision.The experiment results indicate that the proposed system canalign the watch hand with the accuracy enhanced at least twotimes as previous manual method. This paper provides a generalsolution for micromanipulation under disturbance in industrialproduction environment.
