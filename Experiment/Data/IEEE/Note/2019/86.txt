Process monitoring is essential to industrial process maintenance and safety. Typical monitoring methodsfocus on uniformly sampled variables which are rarely satisfiedin practical industries. On the other hand, most industriesare dynamic processes which bring more difficulties to processmonitoring with multirate variables. This paper proposed a newscheme for multirate dynamic process monitoring based on themultirate linear Gaussian state-space model. To fully implementthis approach: 1) the multirate process data need to be welldivided into multiblocks. Each of the block should contain atleast one variable; 2) the amount of latent variableâ€™s dimensionneeds to be properly determined; and 3) the sampling rates of theprocess cannot be extremely distinguished otherwise will lead toa poor model performance. Two cases studied on both numericalexample and Tennessee Eastman benchmark are given to validatethe efficiency of the proposed algorithm on multirate dynamicprocess monitoring.
