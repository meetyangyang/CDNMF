Slip-induced falls often lead to injuries among elderly and professional workers. Active slip and fall prevention could potentially mitigate the negative societal and economic impacts due to slip-induced injuries. However, no assistive device is yet commercially available or reported for slip and fall prevention. This paper presents a first step toward this goal by development and evaluation of a fast slip detection scheme. The wearable slip detection system is small size and lightweight, consisting of five small inertial measurements units placed on the leg. The system can detect the initiation of foot slip several times faster compared to the human sensorimotor mechanisms. The simplicity of the system design, easy implementation, and the fast detection results demonstrate superior reliability and robustness compared to the other slip detection approaches. The proposed slip detection algorithm can find potential applications, such as humanoid robots and control, and healthcare, or home automation.
