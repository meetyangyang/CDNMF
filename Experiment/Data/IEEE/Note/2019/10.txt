The task of routing and scheduling caregivers for HHC providers can be formulated as a mathematicalproblem that is theoretically challenging to solve to optimalityfor large-scale problems involving many clients and caregivers.Although extensive research and tools for tackling this problemalready exist, in practice, even in developed countries, it is stillcommon to rely on schedules generated manually by staff. Whatwe present in this paper is the summary of our theoretical workon tackling such problems. The benefit of the framework that wepropose, the CG-based gossip method, is that it can be preemptedat any time if the staff requires to obtain a good schedule as soonas possible. If ample time is available, one can let our algorithmto run for a longer period of time to generate even shorterroutes.
