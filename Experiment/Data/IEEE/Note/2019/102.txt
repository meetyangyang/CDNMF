Software data analysis techniques play an increasingly important role for understanding the real behavior of software systems. This paper addresses the issue of discovering behavioral models from real-life software execution data. A kind of hierarchical Petri nets is defined to represent the discovered software behavior. All proposed concepts and algorithms are supported by open source tools, and experiments over both synthetic and real-life software execution data have shown their applicability. The proposed methodology is readily applicable to industrial-size software behavior discovery problems.
