Scheduling of semiconductor final testing is usually solved via intelligent optimization algorithms. Nevertheless, most of them are parameter-sensitive, and thus, selecting their proper parameters is a huge challenge. In order to deal with the parameter selection issue, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to self-adjust their parameters. To reduce the computational burden, we propose to use surrogate modeling of the reward function in RL and determine which nests should be reserved in cuckoo search. As a result, our algorithm possesses higher robustness and can obtain a high-quality schedule than the existing algorithms for semiconductor final testing facility. In addition, it has a lower computational complexity via the proposed surrogate model, and thus, a feasible solution can be obtained in a short time for real-time scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed method well outperforms some existing algorithms. Hence, it can be readily applied to industrial semiconductor final testing facility scheduling problems.
