Ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) has become an efficient booster forthe warehouse logistics management due to its low cost, batteryfree, and unique identification. The location-aware technologybased on RFID is an enabling technology for intelligent warehouse logistics. This paper proposes a passive UHF RFID taglocalization method, by which the tags can be easily localizedby the use of a mobile RFID system. The experimental resultsshow that the proposed method can localize the static tags withgood performance, especially low computation cost. The proposedlocalization method contributes to the pervasive location-awareapplication, in which their computation ability is usually limited.For example, mobile robots with the RFID system autonomouslyseek the RFID-tagged stocks in a warehouse.
