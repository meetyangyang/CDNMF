This paper is motivated by the problemof unsupervised anomaly detection in a hydropower generationplant, which operates with turbine systems that are instrumentedwith dozens of sensors. Each turbine has subcomponents or functional areas such as several bearing systems, a generator, and soon. Sensors collect various types of data in real time such astemperature of oil inside the bearing systems, temperature ofthe bearings, ambient temperature, vibrations in each functionalareas, a variety of harmonics in functional areas, temperatureof the coil in the generator, and many more. In total, eachturbine collects more than 200 attributes from its sensors. Thesensor data are then stored in a control system and kept astime stamped historical data points. When a service/maintenance engineer suspects that there is a malfunction in a turbine, she/heextracts a data set from the control system that contains thecollected sensor data for that turbine for the selected period oftime (few weeks to few months), and then stores this data in arelational databases or simply in a comma separate value (csv)file for further analysis. The objective is to efficiently identify andisolate anomalies in the turbines. Toward this goal, we propose anew solution for tackling this challenging problem, which is anunsupervised method based on the concept of MST. The proposedmethod can be used as a competitive tool to aid the practitionersin their search of anomalies for making their systems better
