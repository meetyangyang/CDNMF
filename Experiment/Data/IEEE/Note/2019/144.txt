Cluster tools are a kind of highly automated;  flexible;  and integrated equipment applied widely in diversified semiconductor fabrication processes. Due to the strictness of processing constraints and unavailability of in-built buffers;  it is challenging to effectively operate cluster tools. For a higher utilization of processing modules;  fabs tend to concurrently process several kinds of wafers with dissimilar recipes in a cluster tool. However;  the related scheduling and control problems remain open. With residency time constraints;  this paper addresses the scheduling problems of single-arm cluster tools with multiple wafer types. By dissecting the mechanism of mixed-processing of multiple wafer types;  several formal conditions are obtained to test the schedulability. Based on the multiplex backward sequence;  a cyclic scheduling approach to single-arm cluster tools with multiple wafer types is presented. With the proposed method;  schedulability conditions can be readily checked and a periodic schedule can be found easily. Thus;  it can be applied to solve practical application problems.
