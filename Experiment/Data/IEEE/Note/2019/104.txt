For production systems with complex networked structure layouts, the dependence relationship between machines and buffers is more complicated compared with serial production lines. Therefore, it is more difficult to analyze and evaluate their real-time production performance such as permanent production loss. Such information is critical for real-time production management and control to achieve higher system responsiveness and efficiency. This paper establishes an event-based data-driven mathematical model to describe the realtime dynamic behavior of manufacturing systems with complex networked structures. Furthermore, an analysis method for networked manufacturing system properties and a data-driven system performance diagnostic method are proposed. The methods provide a quantitative solution to evaluate production capacity and production constraints of complex networked manufacturing systems, and to evaluate the system real-time performance such as permanent production loss and its attribution to each disruption event and machine.
