This paper presents an energy-optimal motion planning algorithm that can be easily implemented on a class of multiaxis motion systems. Main advantages of the proposed algorithm are: it produces a trajectory resulting in lower but comparable energy efficiency as the global optimum; it is guaranteed to provide an energy-efficient and constraintcompliant trajectory, and thus is reliable; it requires a low computational load and can be deployed on a wide range of applications; and its implementation is straightforward to any engineer with basic knowledge of numerical methods.
