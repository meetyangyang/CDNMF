Searching and mitigating dynamic targets like the forest fire is a challenging task due to the large area involved and also the time-varying nature of fire spread. The use of a cooperative multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for searching targets in large area poses difficulties in maintaining persistent long distance communication between them. Moreover, the elliptical fire profile demands a time-varying angular displacement formation control of UAVs for effective fire mitigation. In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for search and mitigation of forest fire. The first stage provides a decentralized, noniterative stochastic search algorithm that requires no information sharing between the UAVs. The proposed search algorithm can be implemented without much computational efforts using a temperature measuring sensor and a thermal imaging sensor. The second stage provides a decentralized time-varying angular displacement formation control law efficient for tracking elliptical targets. The formation control law only assumes the availability of restricted UAV communication. The proposed formation control law can handle any targets that demand time-varying angular displacement formation for UAVs. The proposed algorithm is suitable for multi-UAV missions involving search and mitigation of dynamic targets distributed over a large area.
