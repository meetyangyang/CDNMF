Virtual sensing of quality/key variables is critical for the control and optimization of industrial processes. Traditional data-driven kernel regression methods cannot achieve guaranteed high prediction accuracy. This paper aims to develop a high-accuracy virtual sensor based on the self-learning kernel regression (SLKR) model, which simultaneously constructs the relationship between the input and the output data as well as represents the data in a low-dimensional manifold. For practical implementation, the following are necessary to: 1) select a historical data set with abundant information of the process; 2) preprocess industrial data well and eliminate irregular entries; 3) establish a self-learning regression kernel based on local manifold structure and regression relationship; 4) approximate the explicit data-dependent kernel function and determine suitable parameter; and 5) extract regression coefficients from the learned kernel matrix.
