The motivation of this paper is to propose a distributed heuristic method for solving real pick-up service problems in static and dynamic settings. The proposed approach provides solutions with twofold key features. First, the distributed and iterative algorithm of the proposed method enables vehicles to compute routes that are characterized by balanced workloads for the drivers. Second, the method is applicable to plan the daily workload of vehicles and to dynamically adapt the routing plan for servicing the ongoing requests. Future research aims at extending the method to other variants of VRPs and at including the solver into a decision support system, with a suitable use of the modern information and communication technologies.
