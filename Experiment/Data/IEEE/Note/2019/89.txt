In the conventional robotized automation;  the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term;  with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand;  the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming;  which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper;  we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences;  which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly;  such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application;  the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture;  which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal.
