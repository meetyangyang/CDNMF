This paper presents control strategy for the speed-up phase in R2R printing system;  particularly for printing systems with electronic line shafts. Few existing systematic research is relevant with the speed-up phase in the R2R printing system. This paper analyses the relationship of the register error and the web tension fluctuations between two adjacent gravure cylinders which are driven by the guiding rolls;  then proposes the control strategy based on the identification of the acceleration of guiding rolls. The proposed method can be extended to other similar R2R systems. Simulation and industrial experiments suggest that the control method is feasible and has superior performance compared with the existing methods. In the future research;  we will study the adaptive model representing the acceleration of guiding rolls in different R2R web systems.
