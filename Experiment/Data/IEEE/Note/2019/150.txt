Most conventional visual inspection methods can address only one specific type of texture defect;  while multiscale feature-clustering-based fully convolutional autoencoder (MS-FCAE) can simultaneously and accurately inspect various types of texture surface defects;  such as those of thin-film transistor liquid crystal displays;  wood;  fabrics;  and ceramic tiles. Furthermore;  MS-FCAE requires only a small number of surface texture samples to learn a robust network model;  and its training requires no defect samples. This is extremely important for industrial applications because identifying and labeling defect samples is difficult. Moreover;  MS-FCAE can be applied to online visual inspection utilizing a graphics processing unit-based parallel processing strategy.
