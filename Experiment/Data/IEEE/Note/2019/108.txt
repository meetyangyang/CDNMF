This paper seeks to mitigate machining chatters that worsen the workpiece surface quality in highspeed machining processes. To overcome such unexpected effects, traditional passive schemes simply adjust the rotational speed and cutting depth, which do not seek assistance from external power sources. Hence, neither the damping nor stiffness of the system can be changed, and a high maximal material removal rate (MMRR) is arduous to obtain. By contrast, this paper develops a robust active control method to mitigate the chatter dynamics for low radial immersion milling. In the design stage of the milling spindle, two active magnetic bearings (AMBs) are embedded in the tool house as control actuators, which produce extra force to counteract the chatters. In real milling processes, the chatters are detected by the associated inductive displacement sensors around the AMBs, and an uncertainty model is accordingly established with low radial immersion. With the detected vibration displacements, robust active control signals are calculated online, and then fed into the power amplifiers to drive the two AMBs. By this means, a closed-loop active control system is thus established for milling processes, which substantially enlarges the stable region of the SLD spanned by rotational speed and cutting depth. As a result, the proposed active control scheme can be expected to increase the MMRR and, hence, to enhance the productivity of milling processes.
