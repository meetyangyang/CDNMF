Environmental cognition and navigationability are the main function of intelligent mobile robots. Peopleand animals have strong adaptability and cognitive ability inunfamiliar environment, and they can independently recognizeand navigate in unfamiliar environment. Now, the environmentalcognition and navigation ability of intelligent robots are far fromthe level of human and animal. This paper suggests a bionicrobot navigation algorithm based on the cognitive mechanism ofrat hippocampus. The bionic robot navigation algorithm makesmobile robots more intelligent by learning and imitating humanand animalâ€™s environmental cognition and navigation ability. Thisnavigation algorithm conforms to the physiological characteristics and is pretty accurate and intelligent. The experimental resultsdemonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm in building environment map and navigation.
