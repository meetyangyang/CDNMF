This paper was motivated by the problem of automated robotic installation of electrical wiring into an aircraft fuselage. This process typically involves the alignment of a set of long cables along the side of the fuselage with temporary fasteners, followed by final clamping. The cables are connected to each other through electrical interlinks at certain intervals, and cannot be treated as independent entities during installation. Previous approaches have addressed the problem of motion planning for only a single DLO; these methods would fail to model interlinked DLOs. Here, we present a mathematical formulation for modeling the installation process as a manipulation planning problem. This approach would generate a plan to complete the installation process using a finite set of primitive actions. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm to produce plans for installation of cables into an aircraft fuselage, using specifications for an actual aircraft in production.
