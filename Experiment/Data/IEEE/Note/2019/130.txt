Transfer learning (TL) aims to improve training effectiveness by transferring knowledge from a source domain to target domain. This paper presents a growing deep belief network (DBN) with TL to improve the training effectiveness and determine the optimal model size. Facing a complex process and real-world workflow;  DBN tends to require long time for its successful training. The proposed growing DBN with TL (TL-GDBN) accelerates the learning process by instantaneously transferring the knowledge from a source domain to each new deeper or wider substructure. The experimental results show that the proposed TL-GDBN model has a great potential to deal with complex system;  especially the systems with high nonlinearity. As a result;  it can be readily applicable to some industrial nonlinear systems.
