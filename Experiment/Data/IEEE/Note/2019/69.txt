During the past years, unmanned aerialvehicle (UAV) have gained much attention for both industrialand consumer uses. It is in urgent demand to endow theUAV with intelligent vision-based techniques, and the automatictarget following via visual tracking methods as one of themost fundamental intelligent features could promote variousapplications of UAVs, such as surveillance, augmented reality,and behavior modeling. Nonetheless, the primary issue of a UAVbased tracking method is the platform itself: it is not stable, ittends to have sudden movements, it generates nonhomogeneousdata (scale, angle, rotation, depth, and so on), all of themtend to change the aspect ratio of the target frequently andfurther increase the difficulty of object tracking. This paperaims to address the aspect ratio change (ARC) problem in UAVtracking. We present a coarse-to-fine strategy for UAV tracking.Specifically, the coarse bounding box is obtained to locate thetarget firstly. Then, a refinement scheme is performed on eachboundary to further improve the position estimate. The trackeris proved to be effective to increase the resistance to the ARC.Such a method can be implemented on UAV to improve thetarget-following performance.
