For a dual-armed cluster tool with parallel processing modules (PMs);  a closed-form expression on the lot completion time is derived. For this;  we also consider lot switching operations;  where the previous and next lots are temporarily processed together in a tool. With the formulas;  we can send overhead hoist transports (OHTs) just-in-time to tools to unload or load wafer lots in tools;  which can significantly reduce the idle time of tools and OHTs. In addition;  the formulas can be used to design the number of PMs for wafer lots and assign wafer lots to tools to reduce their flow time. We believe that more efficient planning and scheduling in semiconductor manufacturing can be achieved by utilizing our results.
