This paper is motivated by the observation that uniform paint coating can be achieved even when the spray direction is not normal to the spray surface. By allowing a small orientation error, the manipulator maintains a constant spray velocity along the surface while following a more energy efficient trajectory at the end-effector. By doing so, this velocity can also be increased as the proposed method requires less torque during the turns than the current industry standard. The method proposed in this paper is based on a kinematic control method and generates reference trajectories for the manipulator configuration and velocity every time step which are inputs to the manipulator dynamic controller. If tracked, the references will allow the paint gun to follow the trajectory, including both straight line segments and turns, with constant velocity and thus achieve uniform paint coating. We show how to calculate the reference state of the manipulator and present the explicit expressions for solving and implementing the algorithms. The approach can also be used for other applications where an offset in the end-effector orientation improves performance, such as welding and 3-D printing.
