Many critical and complex problemsoccur at the interfaces of healthcare delivery systems. Withinhospitals, transitions occur when patients are transferred betweenunits such as emergency department, intensive care unit, andgeneral ward. Although numerous studies on patient transitions have been carried out, most of them only focus on asingle unit or transition without recognizing the importanceof coordination among multiple units. However, understandingthe complete patient flow throughout the hospital is crucial forhospital administrators in predicting the expected demand andplanning resources appropriately. Thus, a quantitative model tostudy the transitions within the hospital by taking into accountthe interactions among all the involved departments is needed.In this paper, we present a queueing network model to evaluatepatient transitions within hospitals. An iterative method is usedto analyze transitions encompassing multiple departments. It isshown that such a method can result in close estimates oftransition behavior and provide managerial insights to improvesystem performance. Moreover, the method is computationallyefficient that it can be used to study very large-sized hospitals.
