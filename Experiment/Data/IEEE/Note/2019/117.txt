As circuit widths shrink down to several nanometers;  cluster tools for semiconductor fabrication require extreme process quality control. Even wafer delays within processing chambers of cluster tools can cause wafer quality degradation and variability. Therefore;  it is desirable for cluster tools to have much shorter wafer delays. However;  conventional sequences such as the swap and backward sequences;  which are being prevalently used in practice;  may not satisfy tight wafer delay constraints. Our proposed sequences;  which are as simple as the conventional sequences;  have much shorter wafer delays while keeping the same minimum tool cycle time.
