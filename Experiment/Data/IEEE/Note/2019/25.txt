Examples of important problems that arise in automation community include scheduling and assignment problems. Because of their combinatorial nature;  the effort required to obtain optimal solutions increases drastically as the problem size increases. Existing mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) methods;  however;  may suffer from slow convergence and may not efficiently achieve this goal. The new method revolutionizes the way such problems can be solved with major improvements on the overall performance. It is based on our recent breakthrough “surrogate Lagrangian relaxation” (LR);  which has overcome all major difficulties of traditional LR while exploiting the beautiful property of exponential reduction of complexity upon decomposition. To significantly improve convergence while maintaining linearity so as to use MILP solvers;  our idea is to penalize violations of relaxed constraints by the infrequently used “absolute-value” penalty functions. Although not differentiable;  absolute-value penalties have the advantage of being exactly linearizable through extra variables and constraints. The difficulties caused by those extra constraints;  which couple subproblems;  are resolved by adaptive adjustment of penalty coefficients. A series of generalized assignment problems is considered and superior performance of the new method against state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice methods is demonstrated. Accompanying CPLEX codes whereby the new method is implemented are also included.
