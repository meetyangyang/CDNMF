We study the problem of tracking atarget using a team of coordinating robots. Target trackingproblems are prevalent in a number of applications, such asco-robots, surveillance, and wildlife monitoring. Coordinationbetween robots typically requires communication amongst them.Most multi-robot coordination algorithms implicitly assume thatthe robots can communicate at all time steps. Communicationcan be a considerable source of energy consumption, especiallyfor small robots. Furthermore, communicating at all time stepsmay be redundant in many settings. With this as motivation,we propose an algorithm where the robots do not necessarilycommunicate at all times and instead choose specific triggeringtime instances to share information with their neighbors. Despitethe limitation of limited communication, we show that thealgorithm converges to the optimal configuration both in theoryas well as in simulations.
