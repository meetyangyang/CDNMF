Estimation;  such as automatically tracking and predicting the movement of an aircraft;  a train;  or a bus;  plays a key role in our daily life. In this paper;  we provide a new approach for the online estimation of the target trajectory function by means of fitting the time-series observation;  which accommodates the lack of quantifiable knowledge about the target motion and of the statistical property of the sensor observation noise. The resulting trajectory function can be used to infer either the past or the present state of the target. Engineering-friendly strategies are provided for computationally efficient implementation. The proposed approach is particularly appealing to a broad range of real-world targets that move in smooth courses;  such as passenger aircraft and ships.
