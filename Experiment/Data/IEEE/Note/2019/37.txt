This paper is motivated by the need of optimizing the energy consumption of manufacturing systems;  considering the increasing energy cost and environmental concerns. Existing studies on energy optimization rarely focus on flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) which exhibit a high degree of resource sharing and route flexibility and can be highly adaptable to various production plans and goals. Scheduling becomes more challenging when facing deadlock-prone FMSs. This paper provides a method to solve this complex scheduling problem efficiently. In this paper;  dynamic programming (DP) is formulated for it;  and the optimal energy consumption schedules are found. Considering the computational burden of implementing DP in the scheduling of large-size FMSs;  a novel scheduling method named modified DP (MDP) is proposed. Experimental tests on an FMS and a stamping system suggest that MDP can successfully find feasible solutions. Besides;  it can be applied to other FMS scheduling problems and industrial cases;  once their processing time of operations and energy consumption of resources per unit time are known.
