This paper was motivated by recentinterest single-cell biological micromanipulation tasks that seekto understand the role of environmental forces on the mechanics of cell development (mechanobiology) and the biologicalmechanisms that control such behavior (mechanotransduction).In addition, tissue engineering applications require the safemicromanipulation of single cells to desired locations in theworkspace for growing tissue scaffolds. The ÂµFSMM presentedhere can be easily inserted into existing biological testbeds to usefor these aforementioned applications. The designed magnetic coilsystem is compatible with standard inverted optical microscopes,while a digital camera for real-time image processing is already standard in these testbeds. The developed software interface canbe used to prescribe automated microforce controlled manipulations of single cells and tissues in the workspace to carry out theseaforementioned tasks. This paper is also suitable for carrying outgeneral automated micromanipulation and microassembly taskswith advanced manufacturing applications.
