This robotic system has the capability ofsimultaneously assessing five types of defects occupying 80% ofthe total common defects for the construction quality assessment.It can be used in assessing a building quality during and afterthe construction process, which can assist the constructors toconstruct a building with high quality. This proposed systemsignificantly decreases the assessment time and increases theassessment accuracy and consistency. In fact, this system is developed with the main purpose of applying in practical constructionautomation-related engineering applications.
