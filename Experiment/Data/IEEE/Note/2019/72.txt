This paper is motivated by the problem of hand grasp control for rehabilitation purposes;  but it also applies to other hand motor function rehabilitation process. Existing hand motor function rehabilitation approaches generally lack a proper feedback and rely on the heavy burden during user training and the users experience. This paper suggests incorporating EF to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the rehabilitation process. The electrical stimulation is driven by the myoelectric-sensing-based force estimation and encoded in a manual scheme to fit each individual involved. In our work;  a virtual hand rehabilitation platform is implemented to verify the feasibility of EF in reducing the burden of user training and improving the rehabilitation performance;  which allows the expanding of the current system into a broader spectrum of motor function rehabilitation applications. Experiments on able-bodied subjects suggest that the EF in the proposed virtual hand rehabilitation platform is feasible;  but it has not been tested on the limb-impaired subjects and confined to a manual encoding of electrical stimulation. In the future research;  the design of a general EF enhanced hand rehabilitation platform with a standardized stimulation parameter optimization will be addressed and further validated on the subjects with limb impairments and amputation.
