With the development of cyber-physicalsystems, abundant real-time data have been collected from theconverter steelmaking process. These data provide an opportunityto solve product quality prediction problems using data-drivenmodels. This paper proposes a dynamic analytics method basedon the least squares support vector machine with a hybrid kernelto address this challenging issue. To improve the modelâ€™s performance, a differential evolution algorithm is used to optimize itsparameters. Because of the fierce physicochemical reaction in theconverter furnace, it is difficult for a single-stage model to achieveaccurate predictions. Thus, a multistage modeling strategy is proposed to address this difficulty, and a dynamic model basedon feedback error is developed to realize real-time prediction.We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using realdata from a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) steelmaking process.The computational results reveal that the proposed method has ahigher prediction accuracy than other methods, making it helpfulin guaranteeing the specified product quality and in maintainingstable BOF operation.
