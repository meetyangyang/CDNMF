This paper aims at addressing the challenges in monitoring and diagnosing MCPs when there are causal relationships among the categorical variables. The developed method is greatly beneficial;  especially when there are nominal and ordinal variables involved in the MCP. Specifically;  a BN is employed to characterize the dependence structure of the variables involved in the process;  and a latent continuous variable is utilized to model the orders of attribute levels of the ordinal variables. Then;  a novel method is proposed to detect the probability shift in the nominal factors and the location shift on the latent variables of the ordinal variables based on the likelihood ratio test. A general monitoring control chart as well as a directional version which also facilitates diagnosis is proposed. In this paper;  although our method is based on the assumption that the latent continuous variables of the ordinal variables follow logistic distributions;  the proposed charts are demonstrated to perform efficiently and robustly in various cases as shown in the simulations and case studies.
