The efficacy of chemotherapy is limitedby drug toxicity and is weakened by drug resistance. Thispaper deals with the problem of optimization of chemotherapyschedules with mathematical modeling and heuristic algorithmsand is the first to consider the drug specificity, drug combination,and drug resistance simultaneously. The proposed algorithm isflexible. It can be applied to other optimization problems withproper adaptations. The experimental results suggest that the bestfound solution to the problem in the absence of drug resistancemay, however, not remain as the best found solution, or evenbecome an infeasible one, in the presence of drug resistance.Existing clinical regimens may be improved with the assistanceof our method that aims to optimize the chemotherapy schedulein the presence of drug resistance. The parameters of our modelshould be refined with experimental and clinical data to confermore benefits on real treatments in clinical practice in the future.
