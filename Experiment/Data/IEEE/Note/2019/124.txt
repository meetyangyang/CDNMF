There is a tradeoff between power track allocation and battery size in DWC buses. It has been known that DWC buses need not equip a large battery because the battery can be charged frequently from the power track along the route. Also, it has been agreed that frequent shallow charging with DWC can improve the batteryâ€™s lifetime compared to infrequent deep charging. We verify these common beliefs and agreement with a mathematical approach with a widely used battery lifetime estimation model. Our quantitative model indicates that the DWC can positively improve battery lifetime, but this positive effect is always true only when the battery is large enough, even if the battery is charged frequently with DWC. The presented optimization model suggests that the lifelong economic benefit of DWC-based bus transit can be realized with optimal allocation of the power track with a sufficiently large battery
