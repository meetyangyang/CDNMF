Patch-based image registration is a basicfield of study in visual geometry. The collected data sets, trainednetworks, and designed evaluation criteria in this paper can beused to conduct related research. In visual odometry or 3-Dreconstruction, the pose optimization between frames is involved,and the network output can be used as an optimization objective.The patch size can be adjusted according to the speed andaccuracy requirements.
