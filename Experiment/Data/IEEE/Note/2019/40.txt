This paper investigates the cost minimization problem for DGCDCs while meeting delay-bound constraints for all arriving tasks. Previous task scheduling methodsdo not jointly investigate the spatial diversity in bandwidth pricesof ISPs, electricity prices, and the availability of renewable greenenergy. Therefore, they fail to cost-effectively schedule all arrivingtasks of heterogeneous applications during their delay-boundconstraints. In this paper, a new method that overcomes theshortcomings of the existing methods is proposed. It is obtainedby using the proposed SBA that solves a constrained optimizationproblem. Simulation results demonstrate that compared withtwo typical scheduling methods, it increases the throughput anddecreases the cost. It can be readily implemented and integratedinto real-world industrial DGCDCs. The future work needsto investigate the indeterminacy of renewable energy and theuncertainty in arriving tasks with rough deep neural networkapproaches on STSRO.
