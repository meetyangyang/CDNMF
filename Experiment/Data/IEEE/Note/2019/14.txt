This paper was motivated by thegrowing use of telemonitoring devices to facilitate remote, closetracking of disease progression. These devices are usually pairedup with predictive analytics to translate the measurement signalsinto a clinical indicator of disease progression. This is a challenging task because the predictive model needs to be patient specificin order to account for patient heterogeneity. This paper proposesa TL method called PTL that can leverage other patientsâ€™information when building a predictive model for a target patient.The unique feature of PTL is that it can intelligently selectwhich patients to transfer from, and thus preventing negativetransfer. PTL is a just-in-time development for the emerginghealthcare paradigm of telemonitoring and telemedicine byproviding predictive analytics models and algorithms to addressthe unique challenges and contributing to the use of these remotedevices to improve patient care.
