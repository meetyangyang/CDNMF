Simulation is widely used for designing and analyzing complex discrete-event systems such as manufacturing production systems, transportation systems, and supply chain operations. However, efficiency is still a significant concern when using simulation for stochastic optimization problems, especially in the presence of stochastic constraints. This paper was motivated by the problem of selecting the best feasible design (solution) from a finite set of alternatives given anobjective and stochastic constraints, where the performances of the objective and constraint measures can be estimated via simulation. Different from the existing approaches in the literature, in this paper, we propose a new R&S procedure using regression metamodels. Given a fixed amount of computing budget, our approach determines the asymptotic optimal number of simulation replications for each design. It can be shown through numerical experiments that the proposed approach can significantly improve the selection efficiency by more than 50% over the existing methods on some typical benchmark examples.
