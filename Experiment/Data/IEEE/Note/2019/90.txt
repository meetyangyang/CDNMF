Estimating expected performance of a manufacturing system processing different parts across multiple machines is a complex problem due to the lack of closed-form equations. Existing solutions focus on monitoring stochastic variables such as production or failure rate;  or machine dynamics in separate environments often running asynchronous to the real system. This paper addresses the problem of monitoring and assessing the performance of complex manufacturing systems in real time. The proposed framework uses a real-time hybrid simulation of manufacturing at a machine and system level. The hybrid approach is based on a discrete and continuous model of manufacturing equipment integrated to run synchronously with the real plant floor operation. Data from both the virtual and real environments are merged to assess performance. Deviations from expected values represent an error that can trigger a warning signal to production;  maintenance;  and/or manufacturing personnel at the plant regarding health and productivity of plant operations.
