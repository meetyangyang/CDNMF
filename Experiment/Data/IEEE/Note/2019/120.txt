Multirow layout is common in practical manufacturing systems in which parallel machines are often used to improve productivity;  shorten production time;  and guarantee some flexibility. This paper studies a multirow parallel machine layout problem that involves machine groups;  each of which contains parallel machines. Solving it is to locate all machines at multiple parallel rows to minimize material flow cost. It is challenging because one needs to decompose material flows and determine exact locations of machines simultaneously. A three-stage approach is proposed to do so. It is applied to many problem instances. The results demonstrate that it works well for such layout problems with parallel machines.
