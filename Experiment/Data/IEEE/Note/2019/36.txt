With the advance of Internet of Things technologies;  it is convenient to collect data about ADL in a smart home environment via ambient sensors and on-body sensors. This proposed system integrates data from these two heterogeneous sensors and discovers potential activities automatically without user labeling or parameter setting. By reducing the above-mentioned user efforts;  it is more suitable for users and thus greatly helps realize the concept of “aging in place.”.
