Hospital discharge is a complex processwith substantial variabilities and challenges. Delays in dischargeare common and become a nationwide problem. Although significant efforts have been devoted to improving the dischargeprocess, most of the studies are qualitative or case specific. Thus,there is a need to develop a mathematical model to systematicallycharacterize the discharge process, analyze the performance,and investigate improvement options, which can provide a freshlook from the system perspective. In this paper, we introducea system-theoretic approach to evaluate and improve the inpatient discharge process at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital. The discharge process is represented by a complexnetwork consisting of multiple stochastic subprocesses, as wellas splits, merges, and reworks. In addition to evaluating meanand variance of the discharge time, we introduce the notionof discharge-time performance (DTP), which is the probabilityto discharge a patient within a desired time interval, and anapproximation method to calculate DTP. Moreover, we carryout a bottleneck analysis to identify the most critical stepimpeding the discharge process in the strongest manner. We alsopresent recommendations to improve the discharge process atUW Hospital.
