Multisensor attitude estimation is a crucial technique in robotic devices. Many existing methods focus on the orientation fusion of specific sensor combinations. In this paper;  we make the problem more concise. The results given in this paper are very general and can significantly decrease the space consumption and computation burden without losing the original estimation accuracy. Such performance will be of benefit to robotic platforms requiring flexible and easy-to-tune attitude estimation in the future.
