This paper investigates the energy cost minimization problem for a DGDC provider while meeting delay bound constraints for all arriving tasks. Previous scheduling methods do not jointly consider spatial and temporal variations in prices of power grid and availability of renewable energy in DGDCs. Therefore;  they fail to adopt such variations to minimize the energy cost of a DGDC provider. In this paper;  a new method that avoids disadvantages of previous methods is proposed. It is realized by adopting a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named GSP to solve a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with several typical methods;  it reduces energy cost and increases throughput. It can be readily integrated into realistic industrial DGDCs. The future work requires engineers to consider the effect of indeterminacy and uncertainty of green energy on scheduling methods.
