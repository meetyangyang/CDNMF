This paper suggests how to operatecluster tools for concurrent processing of similar wafer types.The results ensure that the conventional swap sequence is stilleffective for concurrent processing. We also provide a simplestrategy of mixing different wafer types and the optimal releasesequence for the wafers. We confirm that the tool throughput canbe significantly improved when the release sequence of wafers isproperly determined.
