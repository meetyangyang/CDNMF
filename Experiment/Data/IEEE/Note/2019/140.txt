Extrusion-style 3-D printers typically pattern material in a series of 2-D layers, but they can be also be programmed to deposit material along 3-D paths in a “freeform” fashion. However, programming a printer to operate in this way requires consideration of constraints related to collision and stability. For large designs, finding an optimal or even feasible plan with respect to these constraints requires automated planning. We address a hard version of this problem in which any joint in the frame can only support one cantilever at a time. We develop an exact algorithm that maximizes the robustness of the printing plan and validate it by printing complex freeform designs. The assembly planner allows the freeform process to be applied to arbitrarily complex parts, with applications ranging from tissue engineering and microfluidics at the micrometer scale, to vascularized functional materials and soft robots at the millimeter scale, to structural components at the meter scale. This approach removes a major bottleneck in the workflow for freeform assembly, allowing scientists and engineers to automatically translate complex freeform designs into optimal printing plans.
