This paper is motivated by the success of cloud-based services. Specifically, we consider the case where the resources of datacenters are accessed through the infrastructureas-a-service paradigm. To efficiently handle the load of requests and to tame operational costs, a proper optimization is needed. To this end, we focus on the selection of the best maps between virtual and physical machines. We propose a holistic placement framework for the deployment of user-requested virtual machines by pursuing different performance goals, such as counteract to hardware outages or reboots due to software aging issues, ensure proper security policies, maintain a suitable service level perceived by users, and reduce power requirements. The optimal strategies are computed with model predictive control, which allows to consider complex constraints and take advantage of future information. The proposed framework is tested in different scenarios characterized by a variety of workloads and traces gathered in a real cloud datacenter. Results indicate that our approach outperforms bin-packing techniques.
