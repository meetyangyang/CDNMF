This paper investigates backgroundmodeling for foreground segmentation with active perception.Recent RGB-D cameras that leverage the active perceptiontechnology have advanced many computer vision algorithms.In this paper, we develop a background modeling method toachieve superior performance by using an RGB-D camera insteadof a color camera. Due to the use of the active sensing technology,the proposed method is characterized by its robustness tocommon challenges. Our method could be used for improvingexisting infrastructures, such as visual surveillance systems forparking spaces. Moreover, the simple design of our methodallows it to be easily deployed on various computing platforms,which facilitates many practical applications that usually requireembedded computing devices. However, our method cannot runreal timely at the current status. We believe that it can be furtherimproved using parallel programming techniques to meet thereal-time requirement.
