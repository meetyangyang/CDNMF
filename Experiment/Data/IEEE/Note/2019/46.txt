This paper aims to develop thevision-based surveillance system to automatically detect fall frombed in real time under the unconstrained conditions. This cannotbe well handled by using wearable devices. Our proposition can be used to construct a smart healthcare room. It is worthnoting that the proposed system is insensitive to illuminationvariation and capable of protecting privacy due to the use ofdepth camera. The proposed human body extraction method isable to address the human–bed interaction well. An effectivemotion pattern categorization approach is applied to ensure thegood separation between fall from bed and the other activities.According to the extensive experiments under the laboratoryand sickroom environments, our fall from bed detection methodgenerally can achieve acceptable result with high efficiency.Nevertheless, it is still somewhat sensitive to noise within thedepth frames. In addition, when serious human–quilt interactionhappens, the performance of human body extraction procedureis not satisfactory enough.
