Currently, prioritizing relevant system tests to be executed in case of changes to an automated production system (aPS) is very challenging and depends largely on the intuition and experience of the testing technician. As system tests involve manual operations, testing requires substantial effort. In addition, testing is mostly performed under severe time pressure and in an uncomfortable environment such as onsite at the customerâ€™s premises. In this paper, an approach is presented that supports the testing technician in finding and prioritizing available test cases based on previous test executions and change analysis. For practitioners, this approach could streamline regression testing and increase the code quality of aPSs significantly, in particular, for fully integrated aPSs, which have not been the focus of other research so far. As the approach was developed in line with industrial requirements, relevance, and adaptability for industrial use are ensured.
