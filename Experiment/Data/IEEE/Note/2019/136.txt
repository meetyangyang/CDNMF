The extension of Auto-WEKA to compose and optimize multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs) developed as part of this paper is freely available on GitHub under GPL license;  and we encourage practitioners to use it on a broad variety of classification and regression problems. The software can either be used as a blackbox-where search space is made of all possible WEKA filters;  predictors;  and metapredictors (e.g.;  ensembles)-or as an optimization tool on a subset of preselected machine learning methods. The application has a graphical user interface;  but it can also run from command line and can be embedded in any project as a Java library. There are three main outputs once an Auto-WEKA run has finished: 1) the trained MCPS ready to make predictions on unseen data; 2) the WEKA configuration (i.e.;  parameterized components); and 3) the Petri net in a Petri Net Markup Language format that can be analyzed using any tool supporting this standard language. There are;  however;  some practical considerations affecting the quality of the results that must be taken into consideration;  such as the CPU time budget or the search starting point. These are extensively discussed in this paper.
