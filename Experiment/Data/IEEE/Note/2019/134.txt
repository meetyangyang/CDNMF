This paper presents a methodology for a partially failed spacecraft with parametric uncertainties. It focuses on solving the attitude takeover control of the partially failed spacecraft perfectly;  while considering the position and speed constraints of the actuator and avoiding the plume impact to the spacecraft. The proposed command filtering adaptive back-stepping control can be used for spacecraft's thruster reconfiguration considering the parametric uncertainties. Furthermore;  the dynamic control reallocation method is particularly useful for future applications that include spacecraft with redundant actuators.
