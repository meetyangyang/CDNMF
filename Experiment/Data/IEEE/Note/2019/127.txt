This paper was motivated by the deficiencies encountered in traditional three-axis additive manufacturing (AM). In practice;  most commercialized 3-D printers are of three-axis configuration;  on which it is required to construct support structures for those overhanging features on the part geometry. These support structures not only cost extra time and materials but also leave noticeable artifacts on the part surface even after the clean-up process. As an ultimate solution to this issue;  the newly emerged five-axis AM platform is able to physically eliminate the need for support by properly and continuously adjusting the build direction. This;  however;  demands a delicate algorithm for determining the changing build direction for an arbitrary part that is currently unavailable. To simplify this challenging task;  we took advantage of the 3 + 2 motion capability of the five-axis AM platform to progressively plan the three-axis printing process for a given freeform model. The core idea of our solution is to decompose the model by a flooding-like algorithm into individual support-free parts;  each of which is printable along a fixed build direction without any support. The nozzle will then follow a prescribed sequence to print each part one on the other. The proposed algorithm is purely geometric;  without taking into account the material property and the mass distribution. Preliminary testing results show that our approach is feasible and robust when dealing with limited geometries that abide a tree-like structure and features a clear flat base. Besides these geometric limitations;  our current preliminary scheme for collision avoidance may become invalid upon an arbitrary complex geometry. We will further extend this method to cater to more sophisticated and general geometries.
