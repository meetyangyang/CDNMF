This paper is motivated by the problemsof robotic grasping, the trajectory tracking of mobile manipulation, which are with time-varying topology (e.g., actuatorsaturation limits, switching constraints). Traditional approachestackling such problems mainly use multiple-models switchingcontrol architecture; however, these methods are not suitable forthe switching conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel control approach dealing with these issues together.In this paper, a unified hierarchical hybrid motion/force controlarchitecture is proposed using the notion of projection operator,and the control inputs are decomposed into the null space,which produces the motion complement of the system and theorthogonal complement space constructing physical constraints,respectively. In addition, an auxiliary system is also designed tosolve the limits from the actuator saturation. The feasibility ofthe system is demonstrated by the extensive experiment resultsincluding trajectory tracking and the switching constraints in thedeveloped mobile manipulator
