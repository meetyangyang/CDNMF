Recently, the widespread use of 3-Dlaser scanners in industries enables engineers to digitize any freeform surface into thousands of data points, which provides anunprecedented opportunity for quality control of complex manufactured products. This paper proposes a monitoring schemewhich caters to arbitrary geometric features on a surface.Practitioners need no prior and specific surface mathematicalmodels. A robust estimate of the surface can be quickly derivedfrom the noisy scanning data by an approximation algorithm.Then, a statistic calculating the deviation of this surface fromthe target one is plotted in a control chart to monitor the stability of the manufacturing process. In practice, this monitoringscheme can be integrated with the 3-D laser scanner as a newproduction module for automatic quality control and decisionmaking.
