Degradation signals have been widelyused in determining the current health condition and estimatethe remaining useful life (RUL) of a component or a system. Mostof the existing prognostics utilize a parametric regression modelto describe the evolution path of degradation signals for RULprediction. The common functional forms of these models includesimple linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. However,in many applications, the degradation signals show multiplesegment characteristics and the existing parametric forms areinadequate to capture the degradation trend. Motivated bysuch issue, this paper presents a multiple-change-point (CP)modeling approach, where the degradation signal is dividedinto several consecutive segments by CPs, and each segmentis modeled by a unique parametric model. To capture theheterogeneity across different units, all the parameters, including the number and locations of CPs and model parameters of eachsegment, are assumed to be random variables following certaindistributions. Then, we develop a statistical method to estimatethese distributions using historical data. At the online monitoringstage, we develop an innovative updating algorithm to exactlycalculate the closed forms of the posterior distributions of thelatest CP, the current segment, and model parameters of thecurrent segment. We also derive a closed form for the RULdistribution estimation. Later, several efficient approximationstrategies are proposed to reduce the computational burden. Simulation studies and real case studies have shown that the proposedmethodology has much better performance than those of existingapproaches in handling degradation signals of multiple-segmentcharacteristics.
