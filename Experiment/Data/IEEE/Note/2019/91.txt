The proposed method is designed for the systems, which are composed of both strong and weak coupling subsystems and are controlled in a distributed structure. The aim of this method is to design a distributed model predictive control (MPC) network for the operational optimization of entire system. The designed control structure and the distributed MPC algorithm with the proposed method could guarantee the recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability of the entire system. To apply this method, the first step is to obtain the models of each subsystem. Then, design the distributed MPC network structure according to the proposed cluster algorithm, which determines the set of subsystems that each virtue MPC controls. Next step is to configure the network information exchanging among these subsystems and construct the optimization problem of each subsystem. Finally, use the existing quadratically constrained quadratic program solvers to calculate the optimal control laws and apply these optimal control laws to the corresponding subsystems. This method can be used in large-scale chemical processes, air conditioner systems for multizone buildings, distributed energy generation systems, and so on.
