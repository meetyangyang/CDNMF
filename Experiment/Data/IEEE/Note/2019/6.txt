The effectiveness and efficiency ofoperating room (OR) scheduling are highly valued by hospitalpractitioners, as the OR department is one of the most resourceintensive units in a hospital. The uncertainty of surgery durationand patient cancellation in OR scheduling brings a tremendouschallenges to the decision makers. We propose a stochasticinteger programming model by taking these uncertain factorsinto consideration. The proposed model significantly outperformsthe current practice according to our case study. We also conducta sensitivity analysis to obtain managerial insights. The valueof stochastic solutions is calculated to show the importance ofconsidering both the uncertain factors.
