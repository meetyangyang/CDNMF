This paper was motivated by the problem of indoor localization in the context of ambient intelligence applications. The localization technique proposed in this paper exploits RSS measurements to estimate the target node position. This technology is very attractive to system designers;  due to its simplicity and low cost. This paper also suggests a new approach using;  on the one hand;  the belief function theory to represent and manage the imperfection of RSS measurements and the reliability of the RSS sources;  and;  on the other hand;  a more realistic modeling of the variability of RSS measurements due to interference and attenuation phenomena that strongly affect signal propagation in indoor environments. Experimental results obtained in two different indoor environments (a residential apartment and a laboratory) are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority compared to state-of-the-art localization techniques.
