A surgical operation usually takes several hours to complete;  which is a test of surgeon's endurance. To better assist surgeons;  several repetitive surgical tasks can be performed automatically with a robotic system. This paper presents a new method for robot-assisted surgical knot tying in a confined environment. Through simultaneous manipulation and trajectory planning of the two surgical grippers;  suture loops were constructed while keeping the suture in tension. Images were employed to guide the gripers in completing the knot-tying process with high precision. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the automated suture looping operation with the system and the proposed method. The robustness of the method was also examined by introducing impulse disturbances and occlusions during the experiments. This proposed method does not require complicated hardware setup;  allowing easy implementations on various surgical systems.
