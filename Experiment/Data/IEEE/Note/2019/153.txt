With the purpose to effectively improve the positioning accuracy for the piezoelectric-actuated fast tool servo mechanism, a hysteresis model with accurate description performance should be established for the further motion control. Therefore, a stable autoregressive moving average model is proposed in this paper. The strict stability analysis of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is carried out using the Lyapunov stability theory. A relaxation factor is introduced to transform the stability condition, the best square approximation method is applied to enhance the performance of the traditional ARMA model. Combining with the established hysteresis model, a series of tracking control tests is successfully conducted. Comparing to the traditional Prandtl–Ishlinskii model, the FTS’s motion accuracy is greatly improved by 20 times. The fast tool servo system has the capability to achieve millimeter stroke and nanometer scale precision, since its performance can be further improved by using other actuators and sensors with larger travel range and higher resolution. In summary, its potential applications will be promising.
