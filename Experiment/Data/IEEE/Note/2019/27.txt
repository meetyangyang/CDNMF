In industrial operations, a lot of riskfactors exist which result in many frequent operational disruptions and failures. It is hence critical to develop an effective riskmonitoring and evaluation system. Motivated by the industrialneeds, we develop in this paper a practical wireless sensornetwork (WSN)-based industrial risk monitoring system. In thesystem, the existing sensor nodes in the industrial environment are organized into WSN to transmit real-time data. A specialinspection robot is used to monitor comprehensively the environmental and safety risk factors in the industrial environment.To obtain the location of the robot, the partial nodes of the WSNare organized dynamically. We further propose two grid cumulative probability localization algorithms to establish the system.We show via computational experiments that the proposed riskmonitoring system performs well and can be implemented asa real application which helps to improve risk management ofindustrial operations.
