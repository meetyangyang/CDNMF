This paper is motivated by the human-robot collaborative assembly problem in the context of advanced manufacturing. Collaborative robotics makes a huge shift from the traditional robot-in-a-cage model to robots interacting with people in an open working environment. When the human works with the robot in the shared workspace;  it is significant to lessen human programming effort and improve the human-robot collaboration efficiency once the task is updated. We develop a TLC model for the robot to learn from human demonstrations and assist its human partner in collaborative tasks. Once the task is changed;  the human may code the robot via natural language instructions according to his/her personal working preferences. The robot can learn from human assembly demonstrations to update its task-based knowledge;  which can be leveraged by the robot to actively assist the human to accomplish the collaborative task. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach via a set of experiments in realistic human-robot collaboration contexts.
