It is recognized, in almost all countrieswith insufficient health care delivery infrastructure, that thecare coordination is a key strategy to improve the effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of the health care system. Throughcommunicating/sharing knowledge, multiple care organizationswork together to create a proactive care plan for the patients to meet their needs and preferences, especially dealing with transitions of care. With the promotion of population care management,practitioners throughout the world have increasingly acknowledged the importance of patient flow streamlining, resourcealignment within each population, and linking to communitycare resources from acute care facilities. However, applying carecoordination in everyday routines of a medical practice can beoverwhelming, even when it is obvious that the changes willimprove patient care and provide efficiency.In this paper, we investigate an easy-to-implement patient flowcontrol policy in making reverse referral decisions for patientsreceiving postdischarge care. We expect to improve providerâ€™sprofit with improved operational management. Through ouranalyses, we want to stress the importance of applying systemsengineering and mathematical modeling to study care coordination and interorganization patient flow control. We also wantto advocate knowledge sharing and accountability establishment,as a well-functioned partnership between hospitals at differenttiers may very much rely on them.
