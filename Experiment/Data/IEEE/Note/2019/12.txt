The intensive care unit (ICU) is themost resource intensive unit in the hospital, which has asignificant impact on patient safety and care quality. Due tothe increasing and aging population, the contradiction betweenthe increasing demand and the insufficient ICU resources putseligible ICU candidates at risk of lacking timely ICU care. Giventhe important role of the ICU in surviving lives of most criticalpatients, it is of paramount significance to improve ICU resourceutilization and maximize the number of ICU survivors. Therefore,the objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model tostudy ICU admission policies and premature discharge decisions.Based on our analytical framework, the ICU admission directorcan evaluate performance measures of ICU admission controlsystem and investigate the impact of different policies on carequality of patients. By using an effective threshold admission policy proposed in this paper, the ICU admission director canbe equipped with a decision support tool for the ICU admissioncontrol decisions with quantitative measures of potential impact.
