Vision sensors provide robots flexibility and robustness both in industrial and domestic settings by supplying required data to analyze the surroundings and the state of the task. However, the quality of these data can be very high or poor depending on the viewing angle of the vision sensor. For example, if the robot aims to recognize an object, images taken from certain angles (e.g., feature rich surfaces) can be more descriptive than the others, or if the robot’s goal is to manipulate an object, observing it from a viewpoint that reveals easy-tograsp “handles” makes the task simpler to execute. The algorithm presented in this paper aims to provide the robot high quality visual data relative to the task at hand by changing vision sensors’ viewpoint. Different from other methods in the literature, our method does not require any task models (therefore, it is model free), and only utilizes a quality value that can be measured from the current viewpoint (e.g., object recognition success rate for the current image). The viewpoint of the sensor is changed continuously for increasing the quality value until the robot is confident enough about the success of the execution. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm in the object recognition and manipulation domains. Nevertheless, it can be applied to many other robotics tasks, where viewing angle of the scene affects the robot’s performance.
