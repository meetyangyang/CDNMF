Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in U.S.and worldwide. Since 2014, hospitals with excessive unplannedreadmissions within 30 days for COPD patients are penalizedby the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Thus,substantial efforts have been devoted to reducing COPD patients’readmissions. To achieve a low readmission rate, effective andpatient-specific interventions in postdischarge care are needed.It has been discovered that a low medical compliance levelis one of the major obstacles and challenges impeding suchefforts, which can be due to psychosocial issues, such as lowsocioeconomic status, economic burden, lack of social support,and so on. To improve medical compliance and reduce readmissions, this paper investigates the intervention process and introduces an incentive-based framework to encourage COPDpatients following the desired intervention plan for readmissionreduction. Optimal solutions under different incentive budgetlevels are derived, which can provide hospital management abenchmark and guidance to design appropriate incentive policiesto minimize readmission. Sensitivity and cost-effective analysesare carried out, and a case study at St. Mary’s Hospital ispresented to illustrate the applicability of the model and theanalysis. Such a model provides a quantitative tool for hospitalmanagement to help design patient-centered intervention plan toreduce COPD readmission.
