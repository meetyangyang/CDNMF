With the development of mobile sensorand data processing technology, the competition between traditional “hailed on street” taxi service and “on demand” taxiservice has emerged in the U.S. and elsewhere. In addition, largeamounts of data sets for taxi operational records provide potentialdemand information that is valuable for better taxi dispatchsystems. Existing taxi dispatch approaches are usually greedyalgorithms focus on reducing customer waiting time instead oftotal idle driving distance of taxis. Our research is motivated bythe increasing need for more efficient, real-time taxi dispatchmethods that utilize both historical records and real-time sensinginformation to match the dynamic customer demand. This papersuggests a new receding horizon control (RHC) framework aimingto utilize the predicted demand information when making taxidispatch decisions, so that passengers at different areas of a cityare fairly served and the total idle distance of vacant taxis arereduced. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problembased on the dispatch requirements and practical constraints. Thedispatch center updates GPS and occupancy status informationof each taxi periodically and solves the computationally tractableoptimization problem at each iteration step of the RHC framework. Experiments for a data set of taxi operational records inSan Francisco show that the RHC framework in our work canredistribute taxi supply across the whole city while reducing totalidle driving distance of vacant taxis. In future research, we plan todesign control algorithms for various types of demand model andexperiment on data sets with a larger scale.
