Biological studies of mechanosensitive neural circuits in small organisms (e.g., Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans) require the application of touch stimuli at quantitative force levels and the observation of resultant behavioral and neural responses. Manually touching a living organism and visually observing its behavior-level response under an optical microscope are commonly performed in biological laboratories, which are tedious and timing-consuming and can introduce unnecessary errors in the biological results due to the inaccuracy and inconsistency of human operations. The presented proof-of-concept system addresses this challenge using microdevice and automation technologies, and is capable of simultaneous mechanical stimulation and neural circuit imaging of Drosophila larvae with a high success rate, high accuracy, and high consistency. The system could also be extended to mechanotransduction research of other organisms such as C. elegans.
