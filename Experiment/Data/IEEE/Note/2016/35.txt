Understanding the usage patterns of webservices can facilitate the creation of service compositions for developers. This work assumes that historical usage information ofweb services carries not only their positive patterns, but also negative patterns. Based on the assumption, this work constructs atag-based association mining model for service recommendation.First, the model selects historical service usage information probably containing service usage patterns from service collaborationnetwork. Then, a novel association mining algorithm is presentedto mine both positive and negative patterns in the form of annotated tags. Furthermore, the model can make predictions of thefuture service compositions.
