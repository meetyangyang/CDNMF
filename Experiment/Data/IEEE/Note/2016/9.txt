This paper is motivated by the problemof automatically and seamlessly handling events that may occurin dynamic ambient environments, while respecting users’ requirements. The idea of this paper is based on designing andimplementing a user-centered Framework as a semi-autonomoussystem for controlling events and ambient environments’ entitiesabstracted as ambient services. This control is performed throughthree main types of ambient services, namely, event-aware services,device control services and context-aware services. Event-awareservices and device control services are used, respectively, as triggers and actuators, whereas context-aware services are usedin the services composition and selection process for contextrecognition. Initially, the Framework is configured through eventrules specifying the user goal to achieve in case of event occurrence. The specified goal is then achieved using ambient servicesmonitoring including dynamic services discovery and invocationcombined with a global and local services selection. On the onehand, services discovery maintains a coherent state of all availableservices that can appear and disappear dynamically. On theother hand, services selection and invocation learn from the pastservices invocations to predict changes and select the most suitableservices. Large-scale simulations and an experimental scenariofor activity recognition in an ambient-assisted living environmentare provided to demonstrate the efficiency and the feasibility ofthe proposed approach.
