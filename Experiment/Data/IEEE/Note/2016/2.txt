If a human operator does not execute thecommands of an automated decision aid, should we also automatethat execution, leaving the operator only to disengage the automation if she/he feels it is unsafe? This paper examines the case studyof the aircraft traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS).Until recently, it alerted the pilots and displayed a commandedavoidance maneuver; new implementations now also fly theavoidance maneuver directly, allowing the pilot only to disengagethe system if they feel it is unsafe. Results suggest that this new,more-automated form may mitigate some past concerns with pilotnoncompliance to the commanded avoidance maneuverâ€”but notsolve these concerns. Pilots were found to disengage the automaticexecution in the same types of situations in which they were lesslikely to comply themselves; in these situations, the process ofdisengaging the automation can slow down their response andthereby make them less compliant. Further, automatic executionof the advisories can also distance the pilots from the task of correctly configuring the autoflight system to regain air trafficinstructions after the avoidance maneuver.
