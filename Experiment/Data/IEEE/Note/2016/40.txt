This research of developing a newpneumatic sucker was motivated by the problem of gripping ofworkpieces with rough surface. Traditional rubber suckers areinvalid due to the air leakage caused by the rough surfaces ofworkpieces, and the existing Bernoulli sucker has the shortcomingof consuming a large amount of air. In this paper, we propose apneumatic sucker forming rotating air flow in an upside-downcup-like cavity to generate suction force. We present the designand investigate a key design parameter (i.e., the height of thegap passage) via experiments. It is found that an optimal valuefor the height exists, and it is independent of the air consumption and roughness of workpieces. We then verify the merit ingripping rough-surface workpieces and saving air consumption via comparison with a rubber sucker and a Bernoulli sucker. Atthe end of the paper, we use the new sucker to pick up severaltypes of workpieces to confirm its applicability. These examplesshow that the new sucker could replace manual work to completesorting and packing operations and play an important role in fullyautomatic production lines.
