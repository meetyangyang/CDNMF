The purpose of fault diagnosis is to identify the fundamental reasons which make the production line out ofthe normal operation. Modern industry process is so complex thatit is difficult to establish a model by a mechanism analysis for faultdiagnosis. The monitoring data of various operations are easy togain in modern factories. We can get the diagnosis by comparingwith the similarity of various operation data instead of the mechanism model. The work of this paper is motivated by the followingreasons: the original data of various operations are nearly the samewhen it is researched from a global view in a complex industrial environment. However, if they are researched from a local view or ina high-dimensional space, they can be identified better than from aglobal view. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to researchthe operation data from both the local and global view in a high-dimensional space. In other words, the operation data are researchedin the whole set (from a global view) and local neighborhood (from a local view) simultaneously. If the operation data are still not identified well, they should be researched in a high-dimensional space.The principle seems that though the building is not identified in theground plan (2D), it can be identified well in a 3D map. We characterize the data mathematically and propose the correspondingmethod of fault diagnosis. The method is applied to the TennesseeEastman process (TEP) which is a famous simulation demo of thechemical process, but it is not limited to the chemical industry andcan be applied to other fields such as the power industry, the steelindustry, etc. The experiments have suggested that the proposedmethod has a better performance. However, in practice, how tobalance the complexity of the method and the superiority of theperformance is an open issue in future research.
