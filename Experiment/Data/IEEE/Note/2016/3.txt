Considerable safety benefits could be derived if vehicles could warn the driver about upcoming obstaclesin situations where the driver may be distracted or the vehiclesensors have better information of the environment due to fog orlighting. Communicating through haptic feedback by applying atorque to the steering wheel has been demonstrated to be effectivein some situations but confusing to the driver in other situations.This paper proposes providing the driver with a haptic signal derived from the tension between the driver’s current steering command and the system’s calculation of the steering angle necessaryat some point in the future to avoid a collision. This avoids the needto guide the driver to a specific path and is therefore tolerant of different driving styles. A user study shows that drivers can clearly interpret this feedback and react more rapidly and smoothly with it.
