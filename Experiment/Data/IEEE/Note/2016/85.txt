With the increasing requirement in modern industries such as in vehicles, aircraft, spacecraft, and remote surgery, and with the increasing complexity and difficulty for establishing an exact mathematical model of an actual physical system to achieve the desired performance, it is important to regulate the system outputs to satisfy a desired objective. This paper addresses the problem of guaranteed cost control with packet dropouts, time delays, and uncertain parameters, in which the packet dropouts and time delays are random and time-varying. Such phenomena are common in networked control systems. By means of the Lyapunov stability method and the robust control theory, the output of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed an adequate level of performance. Future research topics include using mode-dependent techniques to reduce the conservativeness and considering more practical phenomena such as the limited bandwidths to reflect more realistic factors.
