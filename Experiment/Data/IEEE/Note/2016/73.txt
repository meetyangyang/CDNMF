The proposed method is designed for the systems which are controlled in a distributed structure. The aim of this method is to achieve a good performance of entire system within limited communication burden, and guarantee the recursive feasibility and asymptotical stability of entire system. To apply this method, the first step is to obtain the models of each subsystems. Then to configure the network information exchanging among these subsystems and construct the optimization problem of each subsystem. Finally, use the existing Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program solvers to calculate the optimal control laws and applied these optimal control laws to the corresponding subsystems. This method can be used in large scale chemical processes, air condition systems for multi-zone buildings, distributed energy generation systems, etc.
