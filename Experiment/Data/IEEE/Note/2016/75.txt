This research is motivated by the multirobot task allocation problem in a long-term operation scenario where customer agents request services or tasks from anywhere at any time, and robots must provide the requested services or execute the tasks as quickly as possible. Since the robots have limited resources, they must continuously refill their resources in stations before, after, or in the middle of a task execution. They also need to negotiate with each other for task allocation with limited communication range. In order to address this, the proposed algorithm considers the resources of the robots to generate their costs and utilizes a multihop communication network to allow more robots with limited communication range to participate in the auction process. The tasks in the proposed algorithm are executed in a first-come first-served manner to provide services to the customer agents in a requested order, and to guarantee conflict-free task allocation. The proposed algorithm is suitable for various applications such as automated warehouse management, garbage collection in urban areas, and cleanup of factory sites.
