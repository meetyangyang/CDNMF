This paper has been motivated by the problem of reducing electricity bill and CO emissions related to the energy consumption in active apartments equipped with automation system, smart appliances, and EESs such as batteries. By considering users in the center of automation processes, it is fundamental for industrial practitioners to take uncertainties related to the user behavior into account. This means that users might decide to run appliances earlier or later than the optimal starting times computed by the automation system, based on given user preferences. Thus, neglecting the uncertainties related to the user behavior can considerably reduce the effectiveness of the optimal solution and lead to an actual expensive or not environment friendly schedule. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization approach to the scheduling problem. The robust problem is posed as a MILP and solved by CPLEX (using the YALMIP MATLAB interface), which is a commercial implementation of a branch-and-bound algorithm. Having real energy consumption data from active apartments in the Stockholm Royal Seaport project, a numerical study is conducted in this paper. Simulation evaluations show that the proposed robust approach can improve both the CO emissions and electricity bill savings to a large extent.
