Control design for complex system is still a challenging task in many engineering problems due to the uncertainties such as model inaccuracy and unmodeled dynamics. Adaptive robust control is an effective method to handle the uncertainties and external disturbances. Although it is usually impossible to derive the complete model of a complex system, a part of unmodeled dynamics can still be estimated by approximation technologies such as FLS and neural network. Based on the background of greenhouse climate control, we propose a scheme to solve a class of control problems in which the system model contains unknown functions that reflect relevant dynamics as well as input constraint. Feedback linearization and FLS are combined to design a climate controller. The advantage of the presented control scheme is that we can use mature methods to the largest extent in determining part of the control law. Although the motivation of this control scheme is to solve the greenhouse climate control problem, we still hope that it can be applied to similar problems in other engineering fields.
