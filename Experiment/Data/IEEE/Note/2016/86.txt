This paper is motivated by the necessity of solving the complex problem of scheduling the internal operations in PDCDS. These types of terminals are present in some supply chains: they receive products from suppliers according to the aggregate retailer demands and have to prepare new multiproduct boxes for department stores. An automated sorter is the core of the distribution process and is devoted to sort incoming products in new multiproduct boxes that will be sent to retailers. Determining the sequence of the operations has a crucial importance to obtain the right quantities of products, in the right mix, and in the minimum time. However, this turns out to be a very hard problem. Therefore, this paper presents the solutions obtained by formulating two mixed integer linear programming problems and proposes a heuristic algorithm that can be used to solve real instances. The shown results indicate that the proposed methods can provide good solutions in quite reasonable time for real-size cases.
