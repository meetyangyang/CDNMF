This paper is about control design of discrete event systems with temporal specifications. The method is applicable to a large class of systems in the domain of flexible manufacturing, communication and computer science or transportation and traffic. It is suitable for real-time deadlock-free scheduling problems. In addition, the proposed approach is as robust and simple to implement than model predictive control from which it is inspired.
