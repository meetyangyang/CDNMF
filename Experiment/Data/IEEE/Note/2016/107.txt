To apply robot systems in real-world dynamic scenes, the capability of dealing with moving objects is necessary and critical. The key insight of this work is that by exploiting moving objects, many practical localization cases that are challenging for approaches which filter out or separately deal with moving objects can be solved. The main observation is that in the multi-robot scenario, the commonly observed moving objects actually contain valuable information that helps localization. The proposed MR-SLAT algorithm exploits the mutual benefits between localization and tracking by maintaining the correlations between teammate robots and moving objects through the augmented state and thus further improves localization accuracy and reliability. In addition, in the proposed system, data association, which is one of the most critical parts for robot systems to work successfully in practical challenging scenes, is tackled by integrating MHT, and the feasibility is experimentally demonstrated and analyzed. The applicability of the proposed system and the concept of exploiting moving objects are verified through ample experiments in two different scenarios with different platforms and sensors. The manuscript, along with the proposed MR-SLAT approach, accordingly makes contributions to practical multi-agent applications such as intelligent transportation systems.
