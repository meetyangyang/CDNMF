Tracking the location of several inhabitants in a Smart Home using only ambient, noninvasive, low-cost sensors is a challenge. In this paper, we propose specific evaluation approaches as well as an expert-in-the-loop improvement procedure to help the expert setting up a satisfying instrumentation using only such sensors. We also detail the algorithm for online Location Tracking of any inhabitants in a Smart Home and explain this algorithm with an illustrative scenario.
