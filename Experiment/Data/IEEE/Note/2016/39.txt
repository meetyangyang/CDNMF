In the last years, several frameworks andmiddlewares have been conceived and made available to supporthigh-level programming in WSNs. These provide a generic set offeatures that can only be used for the most common applicationdomains. However, it is hard to efficiently support the more specific domain of BSNs, which requires specific capabilities. In orderto fully satisfy the BSN-based requirements, SPINE2 has been conceived as an effective and efficient tool for developing distributedsignal-processing applications. Its task-oriented paradigm allowsdevelopers to specify the applications' behavior by abstractingaway any low-level details concerning the platform hardware andthe communication protocol. Moreover, its platform-independentarchitecture enables code reusability and portability, as wellas application interoperability and platform heterogeneity. Todemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework andthe efficiency of the runtime environment, a BSN-based activity recognition system has been developed through SPINE2. Theeasiness in implementing such a complex system thanks to boththe provided programming abstractions and the framework components reusability is shown, as well as the efficiency of the wholesystem whose performance has been evaluated under a range ofmetrics.
