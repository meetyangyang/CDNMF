The effectiveness of condition monitoring in the manufacturing process is contingent on the sensorâ€™s detection capability for fault parts. An efficient sensor layout scheme is capable of improving the product quality and reducing the equipment downtime. However, under the scenario of SMMP, it is challenging to establish a sensor deployment strategy to handle the heterogeneity among the properties of sensors and faults in consideration of multi-objective optimization in SMMP monitoring. This paper reports on a new sensor deployment strategy based on QCEG to deal with this issue. Based on digraph, a QCEG is constructed by the detection factor, stable factor, sensor node, fault node, and virtual fault set. It is adopted to model the cause-effect relationship between the system faults and sensor readings. Experimental studies on an assembly unit and a manufacturing unit are conducted to verify the presented methodology. The reported methodology can be extended to other complex systems, e.g., the stamping production facilities and flexible manufacturing systems.
