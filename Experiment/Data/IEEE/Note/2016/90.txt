This paper presents a robust energy-optimal scheduling problem of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) with productive and idle powers of resources being random variables (RVs). Uncertainties in energy measurements are realistic and can be induced by machine faults, sensor faults, and many other sources of disturbances. The distribution of RVs is not required and only a finite number of samples are available. An effective scheduling algorithm is developed using weighted p-timed Petri net and Renyi quadratic entropy. The applicability of the considered problem and the feasibility of our proposed scheduling method are verified with simulations and also with industrial energy data logged from a stamping factory, in which the stamping parts are various types of voice coil motor yokes used in commercial hard disk drive actuators. Beyond the robust energy-optimal scheduling problem, our scheduling method can also be applied to other industrial problems, e.g., transportation network routing, portfolio management, wireless sensor networks scheduling, and path-planning for satellite systems.
