In practice, engineers need to eliminatethe disturbance effect of the parallel manipulators as soon aspossible to achieve high control performance. The challenge forthe elimination is resulted from highly nonlinear and complex dynamics, modeling uncertainties, and forward kinematics problem.To significantly weaken the disturnbance effect and reduce calculation burden and engineering costs while guaranteeing thehigh performance, this paper provides an observer-based robustcontroller which can simply restrain the disturbance under uncertainties through using the desired inputs to calculate the nominalvalue. Moreover, a fast adaptive estimator is meaningfully constructed to compensate the unknown friction which is especiallyexist in electrical cylinder due to its spiral drive way.
