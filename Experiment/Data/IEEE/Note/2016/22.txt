Mobile robots that cover specified planarareas typically consume a vast amount of energy. Examples include autonomous sweepers, vacuum cleaners, and lawn mowers.Navigating autonomous battery powered robots raises severalissues. First, the robot must be able to cover its territory withoutcompletely consuming its battery in order to return safely forrecharging. Second, the robot must be able to complete its task asquickly as possible, thus requiring minimal intermediate rechargesessions. This paper describes a novel approach for navigatingbattery powered robots, which ensures that the robot maximizesits usage of the batteryâ€™s life and prevents breakdowns due tolimited battery power. The method is also applicable for cableanchored robots when power demands cannot be met throughstandard batteries.
