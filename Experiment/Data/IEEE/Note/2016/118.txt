This paper is motivated by the problem of planning robot operations in welding applications in the automotive industry. Here, a number of welding tasks have been introduced along the car body: the goal is to let the robots perform such tasks while minimizing the cycle time (or makespan). The main difficulties, from the manufacturing engineer perspective, lie in assigning the tasks to the robots, deciding the order and the timing of the operations, avoiding collisions between the robots and the environment, and among the robots themselves. We present in this work an iterative approach, consisting of two steps: first, sequences for the robot operations are computed in order to minimize the cycle time, while neglecting collisions among robots; then, given the assignment of tasks to robots, the operations are reordered and scheduled while avoiding conflicts among robots. Robot motions are also automatically computed to avoid collisions with the static environment. We show an optimal algorithm, for the first part, based on implicit enumeration (B&B) and introduce a novel suboptimal algorithm, for the second part, to synchronize the robots. These algorithms are iterated while fetching information about the problem that are hard to compute, thus following a lazy approach. Tests on problems adapted from the literature and from the automotive industry, show clear improvements over more sequential approaches and good running times. The algorithms are especially suited for cases with up to 40 tasks and 4 robots, as for typical geometry stations. In future works, we will further investigate efficient heuristic optimization approaches in order to handle larger problems, consisting of more than 100 tasks, as for typical assembly stations.
