Online collaborative design between multidomain designers is a complex task. Traditionally, the collaborative design introduces various documents to transfer the design information between various domains. However, active associations between multidomain models should be established for online collaborative design to obtain high design efficiency. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE), relating the system design models to the detailed design models, are also necessary. Currently, the CAD models are usually generated manually from the SysML models due to the lack of geometric information modeling method for mechanical structure using SysML. In the present work, a geometryrelated modeling method is provided to automate the generation of CAD models. SysML is introduced for system modeling, because it is the standard language of system engineering. Moreover, finding out the model changes is also critical to implement the incremental model update to propagate the model changes (or design changes) to the relevant models of other domains. A general method for finding out model change is proposed. Since design conflicts are inevitable in collaborative multidisciplinary design, an optimization-based method is introduced to evaluate the effects of design changes that may cause design conflicts. If design conflicts arise, the method will determine the optimal alternatives for mitigating such conflicts.
