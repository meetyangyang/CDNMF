Patient flow existing in the intra-hospitaland inter-healthcare facilities is an important management issuethat has attracted much attention from healthcare practitioners. Inthis paper, we develop a simulation optimization framework whichintegrates optimal simulation budget allocation and genetic algorithm (GA) to find the approximate Pareto optimal patient flow distribution. The proposed approach can be used by decision makersto quantitatively estimate the system performance and to adjust thepatient flow automatically that improve the system performancecomprehensively. The result of our approach improves the systemby finding a tradeoff between the Community Healthcare Center(CHC) and the General Hospital (GH) so as to shorten waiting timealong with improving service efficacy and quality. The approximate Pareto optimal solution(s) can also be referenced by government to put forward relevant policies aimed at guiding patientshow to move in the hierarchical healthcare system
