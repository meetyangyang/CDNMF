Improving patient safety is the top priority for hospital management. In the hospital wards;  a patient may experience clinical deterioration during his/her stay;  which can lead to serious adverse occurrences. Quick and appropriate treatments from the nurses;  physicians;  and rapid response teams are critical to rescue the patient. In this paper;  we introduce an analytical method based on continuous time Markov chain to model and analyze the ward patient rescue process on the hospital floor. Using such a method;  the steady-state probabilities of various system states;  such as patient in risky or non-risky conditions;  nurse;  physician and rapid response team interventions;  or transferring to intensive care units;  etc.;  can be evaluated. The transitions among different states and their correlations can be investigated. The study on monotonic properties can help determine the direction of improvement efforts. Such a quantitative model can provide a tool for hospital management to evaluate patient rescue process and investigate strategies to improve patient safety from the system point-of-view.
