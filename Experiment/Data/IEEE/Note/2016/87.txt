Piezo-actuated nanopositioning stages featuring fast response, large force, and fine resolution appear poised to play anincreasinglyimportant rolein fields requiringmicro/nano positioning. Such stages, however, exhibit complex piezoelectric behavior, which is often neglected, including: frequency response, nonlinear electric field dependence, creep, aging, and thermal behavior. The presence of such a behavior observed in the stages poses challenges in realizing precise micro/nanopositioning performance. This paper presents an overview of the piezo-actuated nanopositioning stages emphasizing the key role of modeling and control techniques, where high accuracy is important.
