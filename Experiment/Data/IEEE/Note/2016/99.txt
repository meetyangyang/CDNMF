This paper proposes a direct search method, called SNM-QC, for solving quantile-based simulation optimization problems with inequality constraints. Compared to traditional methods that are largely focused on expected-value-based objective functions, SNM-QC complements the existing literature in simulation optimization. In particular, by adjusting the value in the quantile-based simulation optimization formulation, SNM-QC allows for more flexibility when seeking the optimal solution associated with the problem. The advantages of SNM-QC are that it is easy to implement and moreover, it does not require gradient estimation in the search process. In practice, SNM-QC can be applied, for example, to determine the staffing level in an emergency room of a hospital so as to maximize the service quality of an out-of-hospital system measured by the 90th percentile of the times taken to respond to emergency requests, subject to budget constraints.
