This paper was motivated by the problem of inspecting and controlling the microstructural quality ofaluminum alloy-based nanocomposites using ultrasonic attenuation profiles. One critical quality issue in the nanocomposite manufacturing is the uniformity and completeness of the nanoparticledispersion, which directly influence the homogeneity and grainrefinement of nanocomposites. The standard quality inspectiontechnique is to use microscopic images of microstructures, whichare costly and time-consuming to obtain. Multiple attenuationprofiles measured at sampled locations of the specimen surface contain rich information about the microstructural quality(e.g., grain size and homogeneity) and thus can be used forquality inference and control. This paper proposes a general multilevel regression model to characterize the relationship betweenthe functional response variable (e.g., attenuation), explanatoryvariables (e.g., frequency), and the microstructural parametersof products (e.g., grain size) for quality inference. An efficientgeneral Monte Carlo simulation approach under the Bayesianframework is developed to estimate the model parameters,to select the optimal models, and to infer the microstructuralquality parameters for inspection. The proposed methodology isshown to be very effective in quality inspection through numericaland case study. It may have broad applications where the qualitycan be sufficiently characterized by multiple profiles.
