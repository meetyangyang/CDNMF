This paper is motivated by the challenge of monitoring tonnage signals in progressive stamping processes. By using the proposed monitoring approach, the missing part problem, which is one of the critical faults in progressive stamping processes, could be successfully addressed. To fully make use of this approach, it is necessary: 1) to automatically adjust and determine the appropriate parameters of the RP method for particular applications; 2) to understand the relationship between the tonnage signals and the recurrence plots under both normal and faulty conditions; and 3) to choose appropriate features to characterize the patterns in the recurrence plots for detection of condition change. A real case study shows that the proposed process monitoring scheme delivers a better performance than other methods in literature when detecting the process fault due to missing part. It is worth mentioning that this proposed approach is not limited to progressive stamping processes, but also has a great potential for other fault detection problem by using repetitive and cyclic signals, especially when the fault only exhibits small-signal changes.
