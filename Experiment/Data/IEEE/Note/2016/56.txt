Efficient co-ordination of multiple material handling vehicles in warehousing operations is a complex andchallenging task. The current industrial state of the art relies ona centralized controller, which dispatches transport missions tovehicles along predetermined paths. While this approach makes iteasier to ensure correct system operation, it suffers from severaldrawbacks: the paths have to be laid out in advance, whichis time-consuming and can be suboptimal; centralized planningdoes not scale well, as the number of vehicle increases and itincludes a single point of failure into the system. In this paper,we present a decentralized approach with free-ranging vehicles,where each vehicle plans its own paths to complete assignedmissions and negotiates with other vehicles for right of wayin order to avoid collisions. This approach has the potential to improve system performance, as vehicles plan optimal, shortestpaths to reach their goals. It also solves the scalability issues,as each vehicle makes its own plans, and negotiates for priorityonly with neighboring vehicles in the cases when conflicts arise.Correct system operation is ensured by introducing private zones,in which vehicles can safely perform avoidance maneuvers.In this paper, we describe and analyze our approach and presentexperiments that demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation,on laboratory robotic platforms and on the state-of-the-artindustrial vehicles. Our algorithm performance has been verifiedin environments with obstacles, while operation in corridorsand cluttered spaces is the subject of our ongoing research.Furthermore, extensive experiments under realistic industrialconditions need to be performed in order to fully validate theapplicability and efficiency of our approach.
