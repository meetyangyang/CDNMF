TOU pricing is the most popular policy among various demand response strategies, and has been implemented in many countries around the globe. By appropriately reacting to the local TOU policy, manufacturing companies can save a considerable portion of their energy expenditures for daily processing operations. Given the fact that the improvement of production scheduling generally requires relatively small capital investment, adopting advanced modeling and optimization techniques for scheduling is a practical method for manufacturing enterprises to reduce their energy bills. In this paper, we have studied the problem of optimizing the total electricity cost under TOU electricity prices in a parallel machine manufacturing environment. To solve the problem, a new time-interval-based mixed integer linear programming formulation and a novel column generation heuristic have been presented. The simulation results indicate that there could be some significant load reduction during peak hours while the traditional scheduling objectives will not deteriorate. In addition, tradeoffs between the makespan and total electricity cost have been analyzed via the obtained Pareto frontiers, which could help decision makers to achieve a good compromise between the productivity objective and the energy cost objective.
