A learning automaton (LA) represents an important leaning mechanism with applications in automated system design, biological systems, computer vision, and transportation. It updates its action probability vector in accordance with the inputs received from the environment to improve its performance. It acts as an adaptive controller in modeling a process as well as generating appropriate control signals. The existing LAs simply employ heuristics to update their action probability vectors and then use the vectors for ordinal optimization and determining the computing budget size. This work separates ordinal optimization from the action probability vector and introduces optimal computing budget allocation to maximize the probability of selecting the true optimal action. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods in five popular environments, the proposed LA speeds up the learning efficiency ranging from 10.93% to 65.94%.
