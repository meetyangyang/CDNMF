A cloud provider deploys its applications in geographically distributed CDCs to improve stability and reliability. For cost and performance;  each CDC provides services through multiple ISPs that deliver traffic between millions of users and the CDCs provider. The geographical diversity of the bandwidth and energy cost brings the CDCs provider a big challenge of how to minimize the bandwidth and energy cost of the CDCs provider. This paper first proposes a revenue-based workload admission control method to selectively admit requests. Then;  this paper proposes a cost-aware workload scheduling method to allocate requests among multiple available Internet service providers connecting to distributed CDCs. The scheduling strategy can intelligently dispatch requests;  and achieve lower cost and higher throughput for the CDCs provider.
