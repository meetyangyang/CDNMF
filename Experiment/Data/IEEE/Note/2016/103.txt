The presented solder ball height and coplanarity detection system is immediately applicable to all types of solder ball packages. Two identical area-scan cameras with the same resolution and configuration are setup up at the same angle on two opposite sides. Ring lights are hooked on the camera lens with the same angle. In our setup, the camera resolution is 8 GB, and the angle is 8 –10 . The testing BGA package is placed in both cameras’ field-of-view. If the whole package cannot be fitted into the camera’s field-of-view, multiple measurements on different areas are needed. The stereo images are input by the frame grabber hardware and software and stored in JPEG format. Before the BGA package imaging, the one-time camera calibration is implemented off-line after the camera setup is finalized. For the off-line camera calibration, 25 pairs of stereo images of a planar circle pattern are taken and processed to calculate the camera parameters. The calculated ball height and coplanarity are stored in a file.
