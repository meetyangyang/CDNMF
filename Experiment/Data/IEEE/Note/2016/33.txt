This paper is motivated by the problem ofautomating low-level surgical tasks in robotic surgery, such as, suturing, retraction, dissection, and providing exposure. Specifically,this paper focuses on needle grasp and entry port selection forautomating robotic surgical suturing. Selection of an appropriateway of grasping a needle is critical for successfully and robustlycompleting autonomous suturing. To the best authors’ knowledge, there are no earlier studies in the literature which focuson the needle grasp selection problem. The proposed approachdetermines how to grasp the needle by optimizing the surgicalsystem’s manipulation performance. The existing approaches inthe literature for selecting entry ports for the robotic surgicaltools only consider the teleoperated robotic minimally invasivesurgery, in which the surgeons directly control the robotic instruments. However, automated performance of suturing introducesadditional challenges due to uncertainties in needle localizationand grasping. This paper proposes two new performance metricson selecting port locations from the perspective of autonomouslyperforming surgical suturing, without direct involvement of thehuman user. This paper also presents preliminary experimentswhich demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
