This paper was motivated by the problemof certifying adaptive learning controllers for complex cyber-physical systems (CPS). With the increasing levels of adaptation andautonomy in complex CPS, the traditional notion that such systemscan be fully tested and validated offline is becoming an impossibletask. Additionally, practical CPS are prone to faults in bothcontroller software and physical components. Few studies haveconsidered both controller software faults and physical faults. Thispaper focuses on the design and analysis of a controller integritymonitoring method for a class of nonlinear adaptive controlsystems based on Lyapunov stability criterion, which is a key enabler of the run-time assurance architecture for providing onlinesafety assurance of complex adaptive learning systems. Adaptivethresholds are developed for detecting controller software faultsand unanticipated physical component faults, which may leadto unstable learning behaviors and controller malfunctions. Twoimportant analytical properties, including fault detectability condition and detection time, are rigorously established. Simulationresults show the feasibility of the proposed method to a quadrotoraltitude control system.
