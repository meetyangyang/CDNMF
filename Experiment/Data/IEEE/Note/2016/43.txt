This paper is motivated by services selection problem for an optimal management of energy and satisfaction of QoS requirements, in the context of IoT environments. Theproposed selection algorithm aims at maximizing energy conservation to ensure a high services availability. It is based on the ideathat it is always possible to make energy conservation by slightlyreducing the QoS level without affecting user's satisfaction. Services selection is formulated and solved as a multi-objective optimization problem that consists to find a near-to-optimal solution:1) minimizing the energy consumption of a composite service and2) satisfying the user's requirements in terms of QoS of the composite service. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate theefficiency of the proposed approach in terms of energy conservation, time selection and optimality of found solutions, in the contextof large-scale IoT environments.
