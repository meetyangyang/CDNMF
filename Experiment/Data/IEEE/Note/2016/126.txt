Alarm systems are critical assets for operational safety and efficiency of plants in various industrial sectors;  such as power and utility;  process and manufacturing;  and oil and gas. However;  industrial alarm systems are generally suffering from alarm overloading. This paper provides an overview of industrial alarm systems;  by proposing main causes for alarm overloading;  summarizing current research status and formulating open problems. In presenting this overview;  we hope to attract direct attentions from more researchers and engineers into the study of industrial alarm systems.
