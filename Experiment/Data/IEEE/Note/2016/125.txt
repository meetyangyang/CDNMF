This paper addresses the critical problem of real-time monitoring in an ultraprecision machining (UPM) process, also called diamond turning (DT). The main contribution of this work is the development of a novel analytical approach that combines signals from multiple in situ sensors for detecting abnormal process drifts in UPM. We show that this approach, which invokes a powerful mathematical technique called Dirichlet Process (DP), is capable of classifying UPM process drifts much more accurately than conventional classification methods reported in the literature (e.g., neural networks, and support vector machines). As a practical consequence of this research, an UPM operator can infer, based on sensor data, the occurrence of process faults, as well as isolate the type of fault. This is practically valuable because appropriate and opportune corrective action can be taken to avoid the heavy scrap and rework rates endemic to UPM.
