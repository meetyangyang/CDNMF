This paper focuses on the problem ofreducing the energy consumption of data centers. Based ononline optimization, the proposed method provides decisions forserver provisioning, job placement, and thermal managementto improve energy efficiency. To implement the method, modelsare needed to predict the performance of racks and dynamicalthermal changes. In practice, models used in this paper mayneed to be adjusted to accurately describe the behavior of aparticular data center. Additional sensors may be required toprovide enough real-time data for updating the states of themodels. A successful implementation of model predictive controlalso requires a constrained nonlinear optimization problem thathas been solved in real time. For complicated problems, especiallylarge size data centers, computational delay may cause implementation issue. The fast constraint evaluation algorithm developedin this paper can be utilized to reduce the computational delay.
