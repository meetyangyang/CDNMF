In order for a team of robots to operateindoor, we need to provide precise location information. However,indoor localization is a challenging problem and there is no available solution with an accuracy required by a low-cost robot, whichlacks a capability of simultaneous localization and mapping. In thispaper, we demonstrate that precise localization is possible for amultirobot system using inexpensive camera sensors and the proposed method is suitable for an inexpensive off-the-shelf roboticplatform.
