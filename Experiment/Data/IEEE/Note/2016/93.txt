This paper was motivated by the fact that certain states of AHSVs are difficult to measure accurately in real time during the hypersonic flight. The attitude angles, including angle of attack and flight-path angle, are usually quite small and vary dramatically, which makes their measurements costly and difficult. Hence, a significant need for output feedback control of AHSVs using only the states corresponding to velocity, altitude and pitch rate actually exists. Existing approaches to address this problem are based mainly on a linearized AHSV under a trimmed point. In this paper, an observer-based output feedback control design directly on the nonlinear version of AHSV is presented. Observers using immersion and invariance theory are proposed to estimate the unmeasurable states, thus reconstruct the full states of the system. Then, observer-based dynamic surface control is performed on the reconstructed system. The validity of the proposed control strategy is illustrated through comparative simulation to the full-state control system as well as robustness verification simulation.
