Machine tooling times are an importantfactor especially when producing small batch sizes. Our approachholds the potential to have manufacturing lines reconfigure themselves at runtime, based on descriptions of the functionality of individual devices. It can even consider properties that influence theprocess indirectly (“nonfunctional”), such as the time or monetarycost of a process. We additionally implemented a system that makesthese rather complex descriptions understandable for nonspecialists. In this paper, we describe use cases from the home automationand future manufacturing domains.
