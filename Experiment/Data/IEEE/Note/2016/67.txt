As advanced manufacturing strategiessuch as Industry 4.0 are proposed for smart production, 200-mmwafer fabs cannot be equipped with fully automation facilitiessuch as the automated material handling system to enhanceoverall productivity. To address the needs in real settings,a disruptive innovation manual material handling system wasdeveloped, on the basis of existing 200-mm fab facility, toorganize the technicians to mimic the setting of a virtual materialhandling system manually to enhance productivity. Indeed, thedeveloped solution has been implemented in this case company,in which the results have validated the proposed approach thatcan be a hybrid between the existing Industry 3.0 and to-beIndustry 4.0.
