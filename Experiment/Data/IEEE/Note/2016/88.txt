Most current matrix-factorization (MF)-based collaborative filtering (CF ) models are built on static training datasets and cannot adapt to online, incremental feedbacks without retraining an entire model which is computationally expensive. However, it is well recognized that in modern e-commerce systems user behaviors often vary fast, thereby leading to an ever-changing user-item rating-matrix. This work intends to design a general incremental-and-static-combined scheme for MF-based CF recommenders with high performance. The main idea is to integrate the incremental information contained in rating-variations via manipulating the obtained dataset. A much smaller sub-matrix, which is called the v-matrix, is dynamically extracted and maintained according to the user and item sets related to the rating-variations; whereby, the latent features related to this sub-matrix is retrained, which form the incremental component. In the meanwhile, a group of latent features which is built on the snapshot of the whole rating-matrix is also maintained, which form the static component. Subsequently, predictions for the unknown entries in the original rating-matrix are generated by mixing the predictions by both components, for integrating the incremental information as well as guaranteeing the accuracy. Compared to existing methods, this approach has two main advantages: 1) it can fit any other MF-based algorithms since it is based on manipulating the incremental data and 2) since only a small subset of features are retrained at each incremental update, the computational efficiency is high.
