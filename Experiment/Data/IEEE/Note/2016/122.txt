This study aims at characterizing the dynamic outputs of a wind turbine such as power generation and load responses on turbine subsystems. The turbine responses evolve over time due to the range of time-varying factors. Changes in both internal and external factors affect the power generation capability and load levels. Some of these factors are not measurable (or quantifiable) and thus, changes in these factors cause the wind-to-power and the wind-to-load relationships to be nonstationary. This study proposes adaptive procedures for capturing the time-varying relationship among variables. The results can improve the prediction capability of wind turbine responses, and can be also applicable to other engineering systems subject to dynamic operating conditions.
