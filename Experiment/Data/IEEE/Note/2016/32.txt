Cell reorientation is a key step to manycell surgery tasks. Cell rotational control carried out under conventional manual operation by skilled professionals is based on atrial and error approach. There exists a significant demand forhigh accurate, high throughput rotational control of biologicalcells in multiple degrees of freedom. This highlights the need todevelop an automated approach to translating and rotating biological cells and organism to a predefined position and orientation forsubsequent processing steps. This paper reports a solution to thischallenging problem via the use of a robot-aided cell manipulationsystem equipped with optical tweezers, based on general dynamicequation of the trapped cell.
