This paper analyzes production lead time in manufacturing systems with hardware-unlimited buffers. The main practical insights obtained are as follows. The lead time as a function of the raw material release rate has a “knee-type” behavior. Releasing raw material beyond the knee results in no noticeable increase of the throughput, but in unlimited increase of the lead time. To maintain the lead time close to the knee (and, thus, maximize the throughput), a simple control law may be used: release raw material on, say, hourly or shift-type basis, if the total work-in-process is below a certain threshold (provided in the paper) and do not release otherwise.
