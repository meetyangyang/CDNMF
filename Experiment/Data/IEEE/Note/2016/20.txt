Transit agencies throughout the world arefacing challenges related to provide high quality and cost effectivepublic transportation solutions. Among the transit options, BusRapid Transit is seen as a cost-effective alternative to conventionalfixed guide-way systems that are becoming increasingly expensiveto construct and operate. Vehicle automation systems offer the opportunity of a flexible rail-like bus transit service at a fraction ofthe cost. This paper describes the development of a safe bus automated steering system for revenue service. In addition to precisioncontrol, the main design challenge includes maintaining vehicle automation after failure occurs. The resultant system decreases theworkload and stress of the driver while allowing him/her to operate in challenging environments. Moreover, the automated bushas the potential to provide smoother operation, faster and saferboarding and alighting, better schedule reliability, and increasedmobility for riders with disabilities.
