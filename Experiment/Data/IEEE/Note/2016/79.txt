Coke is an important material in the metallurgy industry. For given proportions of coals, the coke oven temperature (COT) is the most important parameter in the combustion process for making coke and is thus the key to obtaining goodquality coke. The difficulties in building a precise dynamic model of the combustion process and in online optimization of the controller parameters have so far prevented a controller from dealing with large changes in the operating state of the oven. In this study, a dynamic modeling and optimization method was developed to perform online optimization of the parameters of a fuzzy controller for the temperature control of the combustion process in a coke oven. The dynamic model adaptively describes the process in different operating states and is used to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy controller online. This enables the fuzzy controller to keep the COT at the optimal value in spite of large changes in the operating state.
