The procedure of our proposed polygoninvariant generalized Hough transform algorithm is describedas follows. In the offline phase of the proposed algorithm, thepolygonal approximation, made by using dominant point deletion,is employed to estimate the best polygon representations fromthe object edges, as detected by a Canny operator. Subsequently,a scale- and rotation-invariant local triangle feature, based onthe vertexes of the best polygon, is proposed to decrease thedimensions of the Hough counting space (HCS) from 4-D to 2-D and is then used to construct the reference table (R-Table),which describes the relationship between these triangle featuresand the reference point in a template image. In the online phase,the constructed R-Table is then used to locate the parameters ofthe similarity transformation of an object from scene images byfinding the peak value in the 2-D HCS with the maximum value,and a 3-D quadratic correlation coefficient curve-fitting methodis used to obtain the subpixel matching position and preciseangle.
