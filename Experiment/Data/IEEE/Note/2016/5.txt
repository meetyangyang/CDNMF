Statistics show that a large percentage ofvehicle crash fatalities and injuries happen in the proximity of intersections and stop signs. Many automotive companies have already released automated braking systems that warn drivers andreduce speed when approaching an obstacle. A major problem withthe design of such driver-assist systems is to guarantee the absenceof collisions even in the presence of uncertainty. In this work, wepresent an approach using a probabilistic model for human drivingbehavior. The advantage of a probabilistic model is that it allows todistinguish between possible and probable scenarios. In particular,for any desired safety level , our method guarantees safety as longas surrounding vehicles do not use behaviors from the probability tail of their behavior distribution. Leveraging the monotonestructure of the system we obtain an efficient algorithm that cancompute warnings and overrides online. Moreover, simulations ona naturalistic data set show that the resulting override is considerably less conservative than one obtained when driver behavior ismodeled through bounded uncertainty. There are a number of simplifying assumption made in this work, which limit the applicationmainly to prevention of rear-end collisions. We plan to generalizethe method in order to be able to cover a wider range of collisionscenarios.
