One of the main issues with last-milelogistics is the low utilization of delivery trucks, resulting inunnecessarily large number of trucks carrying out the lastmile delivery. This creates congestion, worsens air pollution,and drives up the cost of the individual carriers. Consolidationof orders can reduce the total number of trucks used toperform the last-mile delivery. This can considerably improvethe environmental sustainability around the delivery area andreduce the cost of the individual carrier. Without the propermechanism, however, such consolidation is often not economically sustainable, requiring the government to continually injectsubsidy. To address the issue, we propose, in this paper,a bicriteria auction that considers both the economic andenvironmental sustainability aspects when performing winnerdetermination. We then present a systematic way to characterizethe tradeoff between the two objectives. Finally, we show thatour proposal leads to the solutions that dominate those obtainedfrom the commonly used fixed-rate mechanisms.
