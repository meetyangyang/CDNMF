The work in this paper demonstrates howto switch between two different predictor models for a model predictive controller, based on the relative speed and accuracy of thosepredictor models. Unlike other results in the literature, this workpermits your optimization routine to take multiple timesteps tocomplete. However, it requires that the predictor models each bestable, and that you have access to the plant under control in orderto measure the error between your predictor models and the plantthroughout the state space.
