Design of parallel robotic mechanisms present many challenges. This paper attempts to formulate and solve these problems in the pretext of a parallel mechanism designed for ankle joint physical therapy. The problems include the parallel mechanism itself and intrinsically compliant or flexible actuators used to power the parallel robot. In order to address these issues, a complete design analysis of the parallel ankle rehabilitation robot was carried out. The design analysis was divided into three stages, namely, kinematic design, actuation design, and structural design. A NSGA II algorithm was used to optimize the six performance objectives. The method proposed in this work can be used for the development of all categories of parallel robots with minor adaptations.
