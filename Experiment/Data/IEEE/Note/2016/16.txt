A container terminal plays an importantrole in logistics chains by offering a temporary storage locationfor containers. Containers transported to a container terminal byvessels, trucks, or trains are stored in container yards. They arepiled up vertically to form several stacks. A gantry crane is commonly used to move containers in a container yard, which can access only the topmost containers. When the container that we wantto retrieve next from the yard is not on the top of a stack, thosestacked above it should be relocated to other stacks. The reductionof such undesirable relocation operations is crucial in containeroperational decisions because the throughput of cranes is one ofthe key factors that affect the overall efficiency of container terminals. The algorithm proposed in this paper enables us to obtainan optimal relocation plan that minimizes the number of requiredrelocations in a shorter computation time. When the number ofstacks is not large, we can solve the problem to optimality withoutresorting to heuristic or metaheuristic approaches that only searchfor near-optimal solutions.
