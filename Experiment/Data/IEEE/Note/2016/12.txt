Accurate performance evaluation andeffective continuous improvement methods are critical to efficientproduction operation and management. This paper develops acomputationally efficient algorithm for accurate performanceevaluation of finite production runs in serial production lines withmachines having the Bernoulli reliability model and buffers withfinite capacity. This algorithm is based on analytical calculation,and, therefore, runs much faster than simulation, and contains norandom error. The method developed can be used by productionengineers and managers to predict the real-time performance oftheir production systems with high accuracy, and to guide timelyproduction control activities.
