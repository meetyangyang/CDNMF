Wafer delay within a processing chamber after processing is critical to wafer quality variation or failures due to residual gases and heat within the chamber. Although there have been theoretical studies on scheduling tools to control wafer delays, they are not easy to implement for real tool operation. It is because it is not easy to change the tool operation sequence, which is determined by considering many other factors, and a feasible schedule determined under some assumptions is also subject to frequent timing disruptions. We therefore use a simple feedback control method that can keep the current tool operation sequence and is robust against timing disruptions. It can be implemented by a small change in a tool scheduler.
