Many problems in online planning andcontrol can be formulated as sequential decision-making tasks inwhich an agent seeks to maximize rewards gained (or equivalently,minimize costs incurred) from a series of choices among controlactions. When the task is highly structured, methods from optimalcontrol can provide effective automated solutions to the controlproblem. However, when the uncertainties associated with thetask are significant, solutions to the control problem generallyrequire some input from human supervisors because of the humans’ greater flexibility, for example, to adapt to unforeseenevents. For human-centered automation, one seeks to combine thecomputational abilities of machine automation with the flexibilityof a human supervisor in an effective way. In a previous paper(Reverdy et al., Proc. IEEE, vol. 102, no. 4, pp. 544–571, 2014),we studied human decision-making behavior in a reward-drivendecision-making task and showed that a significant fraction ofsubjects exhibited very high performance, which we ascribed totheir intuition about the task. We developed a model (UCL) of thisbehavior that represents the human subject’s intuition in terms ofa small number of parameters. Estimating the model parametersfrom observed choice behavior would allow an automated systemto quantify and learn the human’s intuition, which the systemcould use to improve its own performance. To that end, this paperaddresses the parameter estimation problem for the UCL model.The softmax functional form of the UCL model is a common feature of models of human decision-making, which makes theestimator we develop relevant to a wide range of decision-makingmodels.
