This paper was motivated by theproblem of developing Internet of Things (IoT) localizationsystems for smart buildings but it also applies to other IoTapplications that have location-based service ability. Existingapproaches to design such systems generally utilize the receivedsignal strength (RSS) from WiFi to build fingerprint for obtaining user's position. This paper suggests a novel technique,named novel localization method (LNM), that uses neighborrelative (NR) signal fingerprint and Markov chain for localization in smart buildings. NR-RSS is used as the fingerprintdata to build radio map instead of absolute RSS. Meanwhile,Markov-chain model is applied to conduct the mobile device's trajectory analysis. In this paper, we evaluate LNM on differentmobile devices with various system parameters. Then we showhow the location of mobile device can be accurately computedagainst device heterogeneity and environmental dynamics. Extensive physical experiments suggest that LNM is feasible andreliable although it has not yet been evaluated on non-Androiddevices. In future research, we will address the design of IoTlocalization that has a wide variety of smart objects equippedwith heterogeneous communication medium.
