The motion of a robot cannot be predictedwith certainty in a variety of robotics applications, includingaerial robots moving in turbulent conditions, mobile robots maneuvering on unfamiliar terrain, and robotic steerable needlesbeing guided to clinical targets in soft tissue. Explicitly consideringuncertainty during motion planning before task execution canimprove the quality of computed plans. We introduce a noveloptimization-based motion planner, SELQR, which computes atrajectory and associated linear control policy with the objectiveof minimizing the expected value of a user-defined cost function.For applications that include both motion uncertainty and imperfect sensing, we extend SELQR to plan in the space of therobotâ€˜s beliefs, i.e., distributions over the set of possible states. Wedemonstrate the speed and effectiveness of SELQR in simulationfor a variety of robotics applications.
