The aim of this paper is to delivermodels, methods, and ICT tools to significantly reduce costsand environmental impacts for the door-to-door recycling ofmultiple materials. The focus is on the tactical planning thelogistic of the recycling service (i.e., operational managementnot considering routing) through the formulation and solution ofa multiobjective optimization problem. The considered decisionproblem is representative of a classical situation in Italianmunicipalities, where waste collection is organized by publicadministrations for large areas and there is still not the capabilityof managing in real-time optimal routing. The model was appliedto a real case study and the results show that the proposedoptimization algorithm managed to achieve a saving of 23% forthe overall operational cost.
