This paper proposes a newperspective for modeling, simulating, and controlling containerterminals (CTs). Usually, the participation of human operatorsto the unloading/loading processes is neglected. However, a badbehavior of human operator can significantly modify the CTperformances. Moreover, a few CTs are characterized by a lowor partial level of automation. Then, the cooperation between thehumans and the material handling equipment is important forexecuting several key tasks with efficiency (with respect to thedeadlines), safety, and sustainability for humans. The complexityarising from a human-in-the-loop system demands for moreaccurate models that can reduce prediction errors and avoidunnecessary extra-equipment costs. Therefore, we propose anapproach to explicitly consider the roles and main functions performed by a typical team of specialized operators. To verify themodel accuracy and validate it, we simulate both standard andperturbed conditions of the Taranto CT. Given that the operatorsare usually assigned well-established tasks, the approach canbe useful: 1) to improve the employment of humans and theirsupervisory activity; 2) to identify critical or faulty situations thatinvolve operators or are caused by their errors and anomalousbehaviors, thereby to improve safety and protect the handling equipment (e.g., by identifying delays and message losses inoperatorsâ€™ communication); and 3) to increase automation,by reassigning tasks from humans to automatic equipment.
