Timely and accurate measurement of key product features is essential in scale-up nanomanufacturing processes. Even though a fast growth of metrology technology has been seen in recent years;  some variables of nanoscale products are still hard to measure;  either too costly or too time consuming;  in highspeed large-scale production. However;  physical mechanisms may suggest that a hard-to-measure variable may be correlated with another easy-to-measure variable. In such a case;  a spatial calibration model could be constructed;  based on which the prediction of the hard-to-measure variable is achievable given measures of the easyto-measure variable. Such a calibration model provides an effective alternative to physical metrology tools in large-scale nanomanufacturing processes in which metrology technology is not fully ready yet.
