 The motivation of this work is to present a general modular modeling framework to be used by decision makers ofIFTTs for performance evaluation and improvement. In fact, one of the main challenges faced in intermodal transportation is precisely in efficiently and accurately connecting different transportation mode networks into an integrated whole thanks to the key IFTT connector. Using the timed PN formalism in a bottom-up approach, we present general elementary modules that may be systematically combined to represent the intermodal terminal under study. The PN model resulting from the composition of the subnets can be simulated to estimate the system performance. The model provides intermodal terminal designers and managers with important key features. First, it can measure the performance indices of the terminal, i.e., system throughput, resource utilization, etc., and can help detect the system bottlenecks. Further, the model allows testing alternative solutions to emerging criticalities. Future research will consider the use of high-level PNs to increase the modeling power of the proposed approach and the structural analysis of the complete IFTT based on the proposed timed PN modular model.
