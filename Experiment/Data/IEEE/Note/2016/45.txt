This paper was motivated by the problemof securing the important data collection process for the Internetof Things (IoT) applications based on the wireless communicationtechnologies (e.g., wireless sensor networks). The traditionalcryptography security method might not be well suited for thehighly distributed data collection process in IoT, where edgepoints (e.g., sensing nodes) are extremely constrained in termsof computing capabilities. This paper explored the applicationof the promising physical layer (PHY) security approach in thedata collection process of IoT, which simply exploits the inherentrandomness of wireless channels and noise to provide a strongform of security guarantee. To model the security performance of the data collection process, we mathematically characterized theoutage probability that the data is successfully intercepted by themalicious adversaries (i.e., eavesdroppers). Such outage metricserves as the guideline for system designers to initiate the tradeoffbetween data collection efficiency and data security guarantee, andthus to identify the suitable PHY security schemes for differentIoT application scenarios. Simulation and numerical results wereprovided in this study, while the experiments based on the test bedor real-world implementations have not been performed, whichremain as our future research work.
