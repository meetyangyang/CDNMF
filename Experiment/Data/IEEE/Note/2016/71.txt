This work is motivated by situations where an automation engineer would like to employ a robot to autonomously perform tasks in remote or hazardous environments where failures are inevitable, e.g., in space exploration and nuclear waste remediation. In order to be able to complete the desired tasks for as long as possible, one would like to make the robot tolerant to failures in its joints. One technique for doing this is to use a robot with more than the minimum number of joints required to complete the assigned tasks. However, it has been previously shown that if one does not properly control the motion of the robot prior to a failure, the remaining joints may not be able to guarantee completion of the desired tasks. This work presents a technique for producing such guarantees. In particular, it shows how one can apply artificial limits on the range of the robot's joints prior to a failure to ensure that all tasks can still be performed after a failure occurs. Furthermore, it shows how to identify an optimal set of artificial limits that balances the tradeoff between pre-failure performance and post-failure capabilities. This technique is illustrated with two examples using a robot obtained from considering three joints of the commercial PA-10 robot.
