The focus of the work is to develop a new statistical process monitoring method called concurrent kernel projection to latent structures (CKPLS) for comprehensive fault monitoring of nonlinear processes. The CKPLS algorithm can be used to model nonlinearities among process and quality variables using normal operation data. The original process data are partitioned into three subspaces: process-specific variations, quality-relevant process variations, and potentially quality-relevant variations. The quality data are partitioned into unpredicted quality-specific principal variations and quality-specific residual variations in addition to variations that are predicted from process variables. Then, CKPLS-based comprehensive process monitoring is achieved to further interpret the faults by comparing the five statistics with their corresponding normal ranges. Although the CKPLS method is illustrated by a benchmark process, i.e., the Tennessee Eastman process, it is also recommended for other industrial processes such as continuous steel manufacturing lines and high-speed train operations for the comprehensive diagnosis of fault occurrence in one or more subspaces. In particular, the parameters in the kernel function of the CKPLS method can be tuned by trial and error according to the practical data feature.
