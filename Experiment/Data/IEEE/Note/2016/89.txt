The proposed data fusion methodology directly addresses the issue of performing prognostics when multiple sensors are used to monitor the health status of a degraded unit. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it integrates the fusion procedure with the degradation modeling to construct a health index for better characterizing the condition of the unit. The proposed methodology is especially beneficial for the case where the degradation occurs in a cumulative manner that results from a single failure mode and the unit is operated under a single environmental condition. There are several steps involved when implementing this methodology: 1) collecting degradation-based signals from multiple sensors; 2) characterizing the degradation patterns of the signals; 3) training the optimal weights for combining multiple sensor data by minimizing both the model fitting errors and the variance in the failure threshold; and 4) constructing the health index based on the derived optimal weights. Our experimental studies show that the developed data fusion method has three main advantages: (i) better prognostic performance; (ii) less computational complexity; and (iii) capable of handling missing data. Furthermore, the developed health index can be readily integrated with other existing feature-level and decision-level fusion approaches as another sensor data to further improve the remaining life prediction.
