This work was motivated by the problemsfaced by the design of detection and tracking of mobile robots forthe tasks to follow a host human or pedestrian in many real-life scenarios, such as museum guidance, office, or library assistance. Several useful techniques and their modified versions are analyzed andadopted for properly and correctly achieving the tracking and following goals in a complex and dynamic environment. The proposedapproach can be easily integrated into the intelligent vehicles forunderstanding their driving environment and following any targetvehicles, and the analysis framework of human and robot interaction. Detailed discussions on different levels of field tests are provided to address the key features of the proposed framework.
