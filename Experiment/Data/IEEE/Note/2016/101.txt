This paper is motivated by the problem of proposing appropriate methods to avoid singularities for a teaching-playback robot manipulator system. Three singularity avoidance methods are proposed and investigated from the perspective of the movement of the end-effector when it passes through a singular region. With NRSA method, both the position and orientation errors of the end-effector are reduced with the same priority. With RSA method, the position error of the end-effector is reduced with the first priority and the orientation error of the end-effector is reduced with the second priority. With PTPSA method, the end-effector passes through a singular region under the joint-interpolated control without maintaining the position and orientation of the end-effector. NRSA, RSA, and PTPSA have been successfully tested with wrist and shoulder singularity through the experimental case studies. Experiment results show that the proposed methods can automatically avoid a singularity for a teaching-playback robot manipulator, which would enhance the capability of robots for industrial automation. In future research, the proposed methods can be extended to simultaneously realize the singularity and obstacle avoidance.
