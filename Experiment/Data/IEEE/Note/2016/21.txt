Despite their conceptual simplicity, sampling-based algorithms are very successful at solving complex,high-dimensional path-planning problems. Their underlying principle is to explore the configuration space of a mobile system bysampling it, and to build a graph representing the topology of thisspace. Sampling-based path planning has traditionally focusedon finding feasible (i.e., collision-free) paths, without consideringtheir quality. However, in many applications, it is important tocompute high-quality (i.e., low-cost) paths with respect to a costfunction defined on the configuration space, which is referredto as cost-space path planning. In recent years, variants of classical sampling-based planners have been developed to explorecost spaces. On another front, other approaches have aimed atfinding the optimal (i.e., highest-quality) path with respect toa path-quality criterion, which is referred to as optimal pathplanning. In this paper, we study a problem to which little workhas been devoted, and that encompasses these two paradigms: optimal path planning in a cost space. In this context, the definitionof the path-quality criterion is based on the configuration-costfunction. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we proposetwo new sampling-based algorithms that combine the principlesunderlying current approaches targeting cost-space and optimalpath planning. These two novel algorithms provide the same completeness and optimality guarantees as existing ones, but convergefaster toward the optimal path, especially on complex planningproblems. These methods have been evaluated only in simulatedenvironments and many applications (in robotics, automation andother domains) remain to be investigated.
