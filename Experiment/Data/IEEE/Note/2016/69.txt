This paper seeks to identify the optimalprocess parameters for the deposition of ZnO thin films on a glasssubstrate using cathode arc plasma deposition (CAPD). Currentapproaches for determining better process parameters for thinfilm deposition include trial-and-error or experimental designmethods. However, these approaches are time-consuming, costly,and do not guarantee improved results. This paper combinesthe modeling and optimization methods to address this issue byusing the artificial neural network, Taguchi method, and geneticalgorithm to identify the optimal process parameters for a ZnOthin film using CAPD. Experimental results show considerablepromise and the authors welcome feedback and questions.
