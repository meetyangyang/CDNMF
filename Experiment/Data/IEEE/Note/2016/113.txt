This paper discusses a way to handle safety and production requirements in human-robot collaborative working environments. A simply tractable set of constraints on the robot velocity is derived in order to meet the regulations imposed by the minimum separation distance criterion. This constraint can be used in real-time to limit the robot velocity, depending on its distance with respect to the human, as perceived by the safeguarding system. Delays in both the perception and the reaction layers as well as stopping time of the robot can systematically be taken into account.
