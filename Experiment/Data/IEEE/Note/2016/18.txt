This research is motivated by the critical issue of energy supplies for manufacturing industry. While energy demands continuously increase, companies are seeking solutions from alternative energy to deal with volatile oil price, legislative pressure and social responsibility on sustainability. Thisresearch considers a combination of grid electricity and alternative energy supplies to reflect a practical approach for the manufacturing industry to utilize renewable energy. The decision variables are designed to be easily implemented into current industrypractice of production planning, and the proposed framework canadapt to any configuration of production system with minimumadjustment.
