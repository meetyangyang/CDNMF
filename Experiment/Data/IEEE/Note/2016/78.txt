Modern chemical plants may have thousands of control loops that have to operate close to specified performances. Control loop condition monitoring systems are commonly used in process industries to identify loops that deserve attention. However, to determine the root cause of a disturbance that propagates through the plant and affects the performance of many loops still poses a challenge to plant operators. For example, if process variables oscillating at the same frequency are clustered, then the question as to which is the root cause of such oscillation arises. If the causal relationships between these variables are known, then this task is greatly simplified. In this paper, a new method to detect causal relationships between process variables is presented. Models are fitted to pairs of variables and residual analysis techniques borrowed from system identification are applied. The method allows detection of causality or its absence and the presence of feedback between variables; and also inferencing if causality between two variables is mediated by other variables. The utility of the method is demonstrated by application to a simulated data set. In a second example, data from forty variables in an industrial process are analyzed. Six of these variables are found to oscillate at the same frequency. Even with the presence noise and disturbances, the proposed method was able to infer the correct root source of oscillation. A comparison with other methods is performed and the advantages of the proposed method are highlighted.
