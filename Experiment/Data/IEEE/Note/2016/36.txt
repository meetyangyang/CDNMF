The automated crack detection algorithmcan analyze an image sequence with full video coverage of the region of interest at high resolution (approximately 0.6 mm pixelsize). The image sequence can be acquired with a robotic measurement device with attached cameras or with a mobile cart equippedwith surface imaging cameras. The automated algorithm can provide a crack map from this video sequence that creates a seamlessphotographic panorama with annotated crack regions. Crack density (the number of cracks per region) is illustrated in the crackmap because individual cracks are difficult to see at the magnification required to view large regions of the bridge deck.
