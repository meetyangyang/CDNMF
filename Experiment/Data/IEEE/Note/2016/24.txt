This paper is motivated by the problemof synthesizing operator-dependent optimal mission plans for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that take into account a variety ofoperator performance characteristics (e.g., workload, proficiency,and fatigue). While the proposed approach is demonstrated in thedomain of human–automation UAV mission planning, in generalit can be applied towards the design of control protocols (i.e., behaviors taken in response to external inputs) for any autonomoussystem that interacts with human operators. The benefit of this approach is that it directly considers human factors in the synthesisof autonomous control protocols, while existing approaches eithersynthesize control protocols without considering human factorsor treat human–automation interactions as a post-design concern.In order to take human factors into consideration, the proposed approach uses abstractions that represent the effects of humanperformance characteristics on human-automation interactions.These abstractions are then integrated with formal models of theautonomous system under consideration, and reactive synthesistechniques are applied to generate autonomous control protocolsgiven a specification for overall performance. To demonstratethis concept, we: 1) develop an example scenario based on aUAV road surveillance mission; 2) propose a hypothetical modelfor human operator behavior and performance that takes intoaccount characteristics such as workload, proficiency, and fatigue;and 3) synthesize UAV control protocols and perform numericalexperiments using tools for probabilistic model checking andtwo-player stochastic games. Based on the example scenario andhypothetical human model, experimental results suggest that thisapproach may be feasible for synthesizing control protocols forautonomous systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in interactions with human operators.
