Tracking problem is a popular topic in the field of control, which plays an important role in actual application. Especially this issue on nonlinear system, which dynamic behaviors are complex and nonlinear characteristic property and the mathematical models are often difficult to accurate obtain. Another challenging issue in nonlinear control is the effects from uncertainties and external disturbances. Usually, building a dynamical system called an “disturbance observer” to estimate the modeling inaccuracy and disturbance is more applicable since uncertainties and disturbance cannot be measured through sensors. In addition, it is noted that saturation nonlinearity occurs in many practical actuators. How to design the controller in presence of saturation has become one main focus of control researches. Motivated by these issues, in this paper, ARC with TSDO algorithms are proposed for a class of uncertainty nonlinear systems to avoid employing large feedback gains in practical implementations.
