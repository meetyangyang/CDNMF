Nowadays, it is very common to usenetworks to transmit information in complex engineering systemsfor all kinds of purposes, such as control, monitoring, andso on. Hence, we need to consider communication delays andlosses when we design controllers/supervisors for these networkedsystems. One problem for these complex engineering systems isthat we do not always know the specified model, only know thatit is one of several possible models. For example, we may wantto use the same supervisor to control different systems such asseveral machines. These facts motivate us to investigate the robustnetworked control problem of networked discrete event systems.The results of this paper can be used to guide the design ofrobust supervisors in a networked environment as we illustratein this paper.
