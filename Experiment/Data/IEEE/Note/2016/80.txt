In manufacturing, machine random downtimes are a major impact on production performance. Real-time estimation of the impacts of downtime events is potentially very useful in helping plant managers to allocate limited resources to where they are most needed. This paper presents a systematic method to estimate system level impacts of downtime events in a multistage production system with parallel structures. A practical procedure is presented to fully utilize the available plant floor data (e.g., downtime data) to provide a quantitative severity ranking of downtime events and associated stations, which is very important for resource allocation and prioritizing continuous improvement projects.
