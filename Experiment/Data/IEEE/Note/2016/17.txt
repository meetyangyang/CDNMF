The goal of this paper is to delivermodels, methods and an implementation platform to significantlyreduce the energy consumption of moving devices. More specifically, the focus is on robot systems where the interaction betweenthe individual robots needs to be considered to avoid collisions,while the energy consumption is being minimized. To achieve thisgoal, a new type of hybrid Petri nets is proposed that leads to amore readable and understandable model. A simple and efficientoptimization procedure is then developed based on the proposedhybrid model, where an energy related criterion is minimized,given paths of interacting moving devices. This optimization procedure has been evaluated for real industrial robots, and resultsshow that it is possible to save up to 30% of the current energyconsumption for interacting robots. To support this optimizationprocedure online, an event- and service-based information architecture called the Tweeting Factory is finally proposed. It is basedon simple messages (tweets) that are combined into high-levelknowledge, to be used for online monitoring, control, optimization,and reconfiguration.
