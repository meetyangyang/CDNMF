This paper was motivated by the problem of online detecting the steady state (i.e., the mean is unchanging) of noisy signals in the ultrasonic cavitation-based nanoparticle dispersion process. Most of the existing online detection algorithms use a moving data window with a fixed length of (or select the latest observations) to determine if the signal is steady based on various decision rules, such as testing if the regression slope is below some threshold. The performance of these methods is sensitive to the characteristics of the target signals, such as the signal noise and signal changing rate. Using only one set of detection parameters (window size, threshold) is not flexible enough to accurately detect the steady state of various kinds of signals. Besides, the moving window may contain oscillating signals with unchanging means, which may result in high false alarm rate. In this paper, a novel and robust steady-state detection algorithm is proposed where the process signal is sequentially fitted to a piecewise linear model using Bayesian inference method and mainly the observations in the latest line segment are used for steady-state testing. Its high robustness and detection accuracy is at a price of higher computational cost. However, in the algorithm all the parameters are easy to select and only the detection threshold needs to be tuned in application. Although computationally intensive, the code of the proposed method is not very complex. In future research, we will address the computational issue and make it more applicable in the situations that require low execution time.
