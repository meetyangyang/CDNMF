This paper is motivated by a new ideaof stochastic sensor networks to realize highly resilient sensingsystems. The new system allows a random subset of sensors totransmit information intermittently at dynamically varying locations within the network of sensors, but calls for the developmentof novel analytical methodology for information processing underuncertainty. This paper presents a novel approach of sparseparticle filtering to model spatiotemporal dynamics of big data instochastic sensor networks. Experimental results demonstratedmodel effectiveness and robustness to support the design of stochastic sensor network.
