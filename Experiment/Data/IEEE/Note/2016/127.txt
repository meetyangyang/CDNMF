NURBS is now a common interpolation method in CNC controllers for machine tools and industrial robots. However, machining a NURBS path is difficult for a machine tool. This work is to provide a systematic way for generating a controller for contouring NURBS path in a machine tool. It can become a software code integrated into the existing CNC controller. The limitation is that the proposed method may require heavy computational load. This is an issue we will address in the future research.
