Flexibility is critical for manufacturingfirms to respond to demand uncertainty and achieve productcustomization. To implement flexible manufacturing systems,performance analysis and continuous improvement play a keyrole. In this paper, we consider multiproduct manufacturingsystems, where machines are unreliable with different processingcapacities for different products, and the buffers are finite andnondedicated (i.e., shared) for all types of products. As manymanufacturing systems, such as automotive, appliance, food, andfurniture production, have such features, the design, analysis, andimprovement of them are of significant importance. However, forasynchronous lines with exponential reliability machines, thereis no effective analytical method to study the performance anddesign improvement strategies. By aggregating different productsinto one and introducing a convergent iteration approach, ananalytical method is presented to approximate the system performance recursively. In addition, bottleneck analysis is introducedto identify machine and product whose improvement will leadto the largest increase in whole system throughput, comparingwith improving other machines and products, respectively. Simpleindicators based on the data collected on the factory floor, ratherthan seeking complex calculations, are discovered to identify thebottlenecks directly without performance evaluation and associated sensitivity analyses. Such a method provides a quantitative tool for production engineers and managers to design, analyze,and improve flexible manufacturing systems.
