This paper presents a methodology to get mathematical relationship between register error and the variation of print cylinder velocities in R2R web printing systems, particularly for printing systems with electronic line shafts. With the relationship, the problem of smoothing the variation of print cylinder velocities can be equivalently derived to the optimization of variation of print cylinder velocities. The proposed control method makes it possible to effectively reduce the impact to drive motors. To the engineers, the proposed approaches can help them to realize a reliable relationship between register error and variation of print cylinder velocities.
