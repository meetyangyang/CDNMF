The proposed methodology lends itself forreal-life implementation of building energy management systemswhere predictive control is desired to reduce energy use and avoiddemand charges and occupant discomfort. At each time step, it determines the optimal set point values of all building's zones andupdates these values over time. In practice, the proposed controlstrategy can be implemented in commercial smart energy boxes tooptimally control total daily energy-use costs.
