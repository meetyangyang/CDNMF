The proposed method is implemented ina user friendly interface software and can be easily used to identify the boundary of the ventricle automatically by practitioners.The boundary of the left ventricle in the first frame of the slice isidentified automatically by level set method and then it could beimproved if necessary by the practitioner to guarantee accurateinput boundary. Then, the rest of the frames are segmented bythe proposed method automatically. The automatically identifiedboundary can be further improved by the practitioners manuallyand interactively after all the borders are identified.
