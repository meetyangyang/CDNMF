This paper presents a biologically inspired computational model that can automatically predict the aesthetic quality of photos. The key technique is AVP that accurately estimate human gaze shifting paths. The method presented in this paper is especially usefully for automatic image recommendation and enhancement systems. Further, experiments shown that the AVP is highly consistent with real human gaze shifting paths. Thus, the AVP is also helpful in designing the robot vision system.
