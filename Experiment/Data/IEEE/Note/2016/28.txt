 Variable impedance control, as one ofthe most popular prosthetic controllers, has been used widelyon powered prostheses with notable success. However, due tothe passivity of this controller, heuristic feedback is required toadjust the control parameters for different subjects and motionmodes. The end result is extensive testing time for users, coupledwith non-optimal performance of prostheses. Motivated by theshortcomings in the current state-of-the-art, this work proposes anovel systematic methodology–including gait generation and optimization-based control based on a multidomain hybrid system–to achieve prosthetic walking for a given subject. This method alsoaims to improve control optimality and efficiency while potentiallyreducing clinical tuning. The overarching technology utilized inthis paper is the use of nominal human trajectories coupled withformal models and controllers that circumvent the need for excessive hand-tuning. In particular, rather than using a prerecordedtrajectory (as is common), this work takes a different approachby using a human-inspired optimization problem to design ahuman-like gait for the amputee automatically. The proposedoptimization framework uses the trajectory of a healthy subjectas the reference and is subject to specific constraints (to ensuresmooth transitions, torque and angle limitations) such that theoutput gait is applicable for implementation on the prostheticdevice directly. The results of the offline optimization are thenutilized to synthesize an online real-time optimization-basedfeedback controller that allows for pointwise optimal tracking onthe prosthesis, thereby improving overall efficiency. The experimental results in this work suggest that this approach is able toachieve stable human-like multicontact prosthetic walking andalso guarantees a more balanced performance compared to othertraditional controllers (such as PD).
