A soft robotic sorting table can moveand reorient objects placed on its surface to accomplish tasksin industrial automation. The surface of the table is soft anddeformable. The surface shape is set by an array of actuatorsembedded in the soft robot body. But which signals must besent to the actuators to produce a specific shape? At present,there is no mathematical model that explains the relationshipbetween the input signal and the resulting shape. In this paper,we analyze if machine learning methods are able to derive sucha model by observing the shape resulting from a number ofsample input signals. Our analysis shows that the computationof a complete model covering all possible shapes is too difficultfor machine learning. However, our experiments also indicatethat the computation of the input signals for specific shapes canbe stated as an energy minimization problem and solved withjustifiable accuracy and effort.
