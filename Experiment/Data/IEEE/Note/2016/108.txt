In this paper;  an important problem in most feature-based machining systems is addressed: when the selected machine tool;  cutters or cutting parameters are changed due to reasons like product changeover;  urgent job insertion;  and broken tools;  the adjustment or optimization to the machining plan is carried out based on the existing feature model. Influences of the machining resources changes to the feature model are ignored. Thus;  it is impossible to get the real optimal machining result. The proposed concept of dynamic machining feature integrates the feature definition of a part to the capabilities of the selected machining resources. By applying the event-driven model of function blocks;  features can be generated adaptively and automatically during the whole dynamic manufacturing lifecycle.
