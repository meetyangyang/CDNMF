- The objective of designing optimal controllers without mathematical models is sought by control practitioners;  whereas existing approaches usually derive optimal controllers by accessing the mathematical models or identified models. This paper proposes a new approach which derives optimal controllers by numerical iteration method without accessing any knowledge of the mathematical models. It gives evaluation for every state-action pair in the whole state-action space through the collected data of the underlying system;  and then selects the action with the best evaluation for each state. What is required initial admissible control policy. Theorems show that optimal controllers can be acquired and simulation studies verify effectiveness. Further research will extend this approach to online self-learning optimal control approach;  thus it can adapt the variation of underlying systems.
