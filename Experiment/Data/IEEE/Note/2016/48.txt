This work is motivated by the fact that exceptions occur often during the complex product production stageand they aggravate the disturbances of a production system. Bycombining IoT technologies (such as RFID, Bluetooth etc.), hierarchical-timed-colored Petri net with decision tree algorithm, thispaper proposes a real-time production performance analysis andexception diagnosis model. With this model, a solution is presentedto monitor production performance and analyze exceptions in realtime. We show how such model can be efficiently applied to shopfloor monitoring and control.
