The motivation of this paper is to designan urban-decision support system (U-DSS) for use by decisionmakers (DMs) in the offline optimal planning of the vehicleassignment and routing in different services, such as postaldelivery and waste collection. The U-DSS provides solutions tothe DMs with threefold important key features. First, the modeledand solved vehicle routing problem is general and can considerseveral landfills, set of vehicles with different capacities andspeeds, several shifts and routes satisfying capacity, and timeconstraints. Second, the traveling times are obtained by the routesand the distances are determined by Google Map applicationprogramming interface, the traffic, and weather forecasts. Third,the solutions are obtained in extremely short times, even ifthe dimensions of the problem are very large. Future researchaims at extending the U-DSS by considering dynamic routingand modifying in real time the planning of the routes witha suitable use of the modern information and communicationtechnologies.
