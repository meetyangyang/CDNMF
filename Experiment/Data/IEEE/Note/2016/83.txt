High-speed railway system (HRS), as a practical engineering system, is inevitably nonlinear subject to the aerodynamic problems, the limitation of actuators and the timedelay occurrence. However, there is little work done to consider those factors simultaneously. This motivates the work of this note. Based on the outstanding repetitive operation pattern of a train, the control strategies of speed trajectory tracking are addressed in the framework of ILC, which is primarily a data driven modelfree control method. To avoid the passenger's discomfort with the speedup of trains, the adaptive control is employed in the iteration domain to solve the nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties in train motion dynamics. By constructing a robust term in the controller, the time-varying speed delays, which may occur frequently during operation process arising from weather conditions, construction works, human factors and regulation managements, etc., are compensated. To further enhance the applicability, the corresponding control scheme under traction/braking force constraint is also considered. Although the effectiveness of the novel AILC-based train control method has been proved through the rigorous theoretical analyses, the field experiments have not been carried out yet. Some other practical concerns, such as operationdepended disturbances and actuator failures in train operations, should be further studied.
