This paper is motivated by the problem of reliable and fast implementation of mode schedulingalgorithms in real-time applications, where control authority isdiscrete. Switched systems cover a range of real-world controlplatforms, such as antilock braking systems and other valveoperated settings. However, most current approaches to dynamiccompensation rely on specialized ordinary differential equations(ODE) solvers to simulate the hybrid dynamics and, thus,exhibit high execution times and/or approximation errors. In ourapproach, we only require that a set of data are calculatedoffline and stored in memory, so that online computationalcomplexity is significantly reduced. Importantly, for memoryefficiency, we show that approximation accuracy is independentof the number of stored samples, i.e., the size of the stored dataset. Using the robot operating system, we apply the proposedalgorithm to regulate the swing angle of a mass suspended froma planar robotic system in real time with hybrid control signals.Our experimental results verify that our algorithm is fast andrejects disturbances online even using inexpensive hardware forsensing and actuation. This result presents an opportunity forthe real-time optimal control of automation platforms with finiteset of control signals.
