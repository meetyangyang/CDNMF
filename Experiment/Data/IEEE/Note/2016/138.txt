This paper was first motivated by the problem of aiming wheeled duct-cleaning robots to work in round ducts autonomously. To solve the motion control of WMRs in round ducts, kinematic models are analyzed and established. In the progress of the project, we found that sliding is unavoidable. Therefore we analyzed this phenomenon with academic thought. The results of the experiments showed that the proposed method was useful and valid. The limitations of the work are that the control law should be adjusted according to the configuration of the WMR. The obtained results could be used to make WMRs working in round ducts or pipes autonomously, which will relax the operator significantly.
