Most physical goods deteriorate during their normal storage period. Under production capacity and no shortage constraints, pricing and dynamic inventory management policies are important for improving the profit of a manufacturing company, particularly in the presence of perishable products. This paper presents a pricing and continuous-time production strategy for perishable products with a control-based method, which can provide a more exact solution of the system than a discrete-time approach. The presented model is able to support key tactical design decisions related to the optimal sales price, production rate, deterioration coefficient and production capacity.
