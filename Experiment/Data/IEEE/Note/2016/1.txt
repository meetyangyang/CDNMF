This paper is motivated by the problemof synthesizing policies for a class of human-in-the-loop systemsin which the control authority is switched between a human operator and an autonomous controller. The objective is to designa policy that balances human workload and system performanceunder temporal logic constraints. To this end, this paper developsa synthesis method that takes into account the evolution of humanoperators cognitive and physiological states, such as fatigue, stress,and attention, given the tasks to be accomplished and the difficulty levels of the tasks. For a given system, by building its abstractmodel from a set of factors that capture both dynamic evolutionof the system and human performance, we show that multi-objective optimization can be extended to compute policies that balancethe human operators workload and the performance of the overallsystem. The proposed methods are applicable to semi-autonomousdriving, tele-operated robotic systems, and other systems in whicha human operator and an autonomous control share the controlauthority. The approach has limitations in two aspects: One is theassumption of the availability of the human operators cognitivemodel. Another is the assumption on perfect information duringcontrol execution. The authors believe that both limitations can beaddressed and mechanisms that work in more general settings arealready subject to their current research (with preliminary resultsalready obtained).
