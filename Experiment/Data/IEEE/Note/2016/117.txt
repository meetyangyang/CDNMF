The steelmaking rescheduling process is critical to the effective operation of iron and steel production. This study models the steelmaking rescheduling problem with flexible processing time as a complex hybrid flowshop in which two types of disruptions;  machine breakdown and processing variation;  are considered concurrently. A weighted sum of the five objectives;  including minimization of the average sojourn time;  earliness penalty;  tardiness penalty;  cast-break penalty;  and system instability penalty;  is considered in the proposed algorithm. We develop an effective hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) that applies two vectors to represent individuals and presents routing and scheduling neighborhood structures. An IG-based local search procedure is embedded to enhance the exploitation ability of the proposed algorithm. Two decoding heuristics considering the problem characteristics are developed. The effectiveness of the proposed HFOA is demonstrated through comparisons to other well-known and recently developed meta-heuristics. This work can be extended to practical problems by considering other types of disruptions. In addition;  the proposed HFOA can also be generalized;  and to other hybrid flowshop rescheduling problems.
