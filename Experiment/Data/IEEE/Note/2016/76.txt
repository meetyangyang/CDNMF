The caterpillar-like climbing locomotion strongly enhances the climbing versatility and stability. However, to realize the caterpillar-like climbing locomotion, a climbing robot with redundant DOF must be constructed to simulate the caterpillars' multisegmented body trunk. Together an effective redundancy resolution method is need for real-time realizing of the caterpillar-like climbing locomotion. In this paper, we transfer the caterpillar-like locomotion problem into a redundant end-effector tracking problem, and present a novel dual-mode controller for the resolution of tracking redundancies. It should be noted that the dual-mode controller well resolves the redundant tracking problem even when the robot configuration is ill-conditioned. We illustrate the practical application effectiveness of the presented climbing methodology through simulations and experiments.
