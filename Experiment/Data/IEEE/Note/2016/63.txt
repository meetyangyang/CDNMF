The PI is a contemporary conceptualization of a highly modular logistics network that mimics therouting of packets over a network of hubs in the virtual Internet.PI logistics may pose great opportunities for economies of scalein freight transportation and warehousing, and for improvingthe environmental performance of shipper or carrier companies.We therefore present a novel cost-minimizing mathematicalmodel within the PI setting that includes shipment consolidationand dispatch decisions. To show the utility of our models,we contrast the performance results of two comparable systems:one in the PI and the other in traditional logistics network. Basedon the simulation results for the case of a European PI logisticsnetwork, it is seen that the PI system has a higher degree ofload consolidation, i.e., combining two or more shipments on avehicle to be linehauled to the same destination, and proves cost efficient on the average, but at the expense of longer deliverytimes for individual shipments. In the fast-changing landscape ofglobal supply and demand management, logistics manifests itselfas one of the most crucial cost and service drivers of supplychain performance in virtually all manufacturing, merchandising,or service firms. In this paper, we expose the potential benefitsand drawbacks of the PI for the logistics sector by devising betterdecision tools for managers.
