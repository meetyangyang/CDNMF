Key management is one of the hardestproblems in cyber security. It is even more challenging in theInternet of IoT considering that most things are resource-constrained. Therefore, IoT devices either end-up using the symmetriccryptography with preshared key (PSK) mode or asymmetriccryptography with raw public keys (RPKs) mode. These modeseither require a preprovisioning of all expected trusted clientsin individual nodes before deployment or requires out-of-bandvalidation of RPKs. Also, if the number of clients that a nodewould communicate with varies dynamically, this would demandfrequent reprovisioning of each trusted client to the individualnodes. The approach based on preprovisioning and reprovisioningof trusted keys is certainly not scalable and requires a continuousmanagement of security policies. We therefore propose a solutionthat is scalable and does not require preprovisioning or reprovisioning the individual nodes with keys for all future trusted clients.The basic approach is to establish shared keys between resourceservers and a trust anchor. When a client wants to establish atrust relationship with a resource server it requests a key from atrust anchor. The trust anchor asserts a secret key or a public keyof the client that can be conveyed to the resource server.
