Transient performance evaluation is of critical importance in real-time production analysis and control. In practice, computer simulation is the main tool for this purpose. Despite its many advantages, simulation can be time-consuming and the results usually contain random errors. This paper develops a computationally efficient algorithm for accurate performance evaluation of assembly systems with machines having Bernoulli reliability model and buffers with finite capacity. This algorithm is based on analytical calculation, and, therefore, runs much faster than simulation, and contains no random error. The method developed can be used by production engineers and managers to predict the real-time performance of their production systems with high accuracy, and to guide timely production control activities.
