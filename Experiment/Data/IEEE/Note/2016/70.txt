The paper brings contributions in the area of mobile robots by presenting a procedure for planning a team of robots in a dynamic environment based on high-level requirements. More specifically, we assume a team of identical mobile robots that should automatically accomplish a global mission that includes logical and temporal requirements on attainment or avoidance of some regions from the environment. The regions (areas) of interest alternate between being visible (appeared) or invisible (disappeared) based on probabilistic events. Our method develops an initial movement plan for robots such that the mission has a good chance of being satisfied, and it updates this plan whenever necessary, based on actual observations yielded by the robots. The framework can be used for automatically planning intelligent autonomous systems while possible applications include: robots used for search and rescue missions (where casualties may randomly appear in dangerous areas), automatic transportation systems that should visit some areas where passengers have known rates of appearance, or autonomous vacuum cleaners that allow rich specifications to be input by the owner (such as clean the living room and the dorms, where dust may appear with different rates, and then go to charge in either dorm). As usual for many systems that automatically handle various complex but friendly inputs from the human operator, the proposed method induces a computational overhead when compared to classical methods developed only for specific situations.
