This work is a software design methodology to be applied in the first stages of describing a multilateralmanipulation task. The multilateral manipulation software framework can be built on top of ROS or CISST, or built independentof these libraries. We break down the formalization of a multilateral manipulation task into seven base classes. The base classesfacilitate completion of the task and include input/output characteristics: human-interface devices, graphical display, and data logging. Extensions to these base classes specify the framework forthe task at hand; in this work, a simulated surgical task. Interfacesbetween the classes are simple, well defined, and easily extensible,facilitating integration of this structure to tasks other than the onedemonstrated in this work. Through careful adherence to the specifications of our software framework, we quickly and cleanly prototyped five different collaboration models between a human operator and a robotic agent with minimal redundant code. Differentcollaboration models can broaden our understanding of multilateral manipulation and enable us to think about new ways to investigate human-centered autonomy. The software framework can beaccessed
