This paper was motivated by real-lifeproblems when companies are going to implement automationwith automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Using the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, a more precise locatingapproach is proposed. This approach uses active RFID tagsfor localization. Dolph-Chebyshev antenna array is used in thissystem to enable AGV with more precise location implementationby making full use of the multipath effect elimination method.
