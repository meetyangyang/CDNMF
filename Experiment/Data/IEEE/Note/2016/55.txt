Many cluster tools or other automatedsystems have critical time constraints and are subject to time variability. They often do not repeat identical work cycles. Our proposed method can verify whether such systems can satisfy the timeconstraints. Engineers can also accommodate parameters such asprocessing times and the number of parallel chambers so as to meetthe schedulability conditions. Furthermore, they can appropriatelydelay some tasks to meet the time constraints.
