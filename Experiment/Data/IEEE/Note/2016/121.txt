Lithium-based battery technology offers performance advantages over traditional battery technologies, which makes it promising in application such as automobiles, portable devices, power grid, etc. To ensure the Lithium-ion batteries working efficiently, reliably and safely, battery equalization systems play a critical rule, especially in large volume battery packs. Various equalization structures have been proposed to balance the state of charge within a string of battery cells. In this paper, we first review the state-of-the-art equalization structures in a unified model representation scheme, and then focus on a modularized global equalization structure with much less equalizers. Based on the mathematical models for performance evaluation, the modularized global equalization system outperforms the state-of-the-art structures in terms of energy loss with similar equalization speed. In addition, we provide a module segmentation guide to determine the number of modules in the system design.
