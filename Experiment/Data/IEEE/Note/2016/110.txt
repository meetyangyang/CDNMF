This paper was motivated by the problem of sorting ovine offal in industrial meat processing. The slippery, delicate organs are difficult to handle and easily damaged by rigid robotic grippers. We therefore conceptualized a soft peristaltic xy-sorting table that allows for a compliant manipulation and repositioning of the organs as a preparatory step for onward processing. However, soft-bodied robots have not been used in industrial automation. The existing control methods aim at basic repetitive motions, mostly for self-locomotion and using open-loop control. The complex behaviors required for industrial manipulation tasks are difficult to control in soft-bodied robots. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a probabilistic automaton which allows for a modular approach by concatenating control primitives for basic actuation patterns. The selection of actuation patterns is based on sensor input about the state of the objects on the sorting table. We show how to find the optimum sequence of basic behaviors efficiently, even in the presence of noise and errors.
