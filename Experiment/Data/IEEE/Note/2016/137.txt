To eliminate the influence of operator availability and reduce work-in-process between consecutive processes steps, cluster tools with job cascading are commonly seen in contemporary production systems, such as in the semiconductor or pharmaceutical industries. Due to the strong dependence among the servers in a cascading machine, the exact analysis for queue time is difficult in general. To better understand the system performance of contemporary production systems with cluster tools, this study developed analytical models to approximate the mean queue time of a cascading machine subject to random failures. The model can be used as an elementary building block to evaluate the performance of a complex production system with cluster tools.
