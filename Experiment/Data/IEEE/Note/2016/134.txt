Scheduling transient cycles such as start-up;  close-down;  and lot-switching cycles is an important issue for cluster tools due to frequent lot switchings;  cleaning;  and machine breakdown. In this paper;  we propose a generalized backward sequence to schedule a wafer lot from the start-up cycle to the close-down cycle in a single-armed cluster tool with parallel chambers. The workload-based analysis is used for computing a lower bound on the makespan of a lot. We prove that the generalized backward sequence has an optimal makespan in most practical cases. Process engineers can adjust the workloads of process steps to improve the tool productivity based on our results. Even though the optimality conditions are not satisfied;  we show that the generalized backward sequence still provides a reasonable makespan experimentally.
