This paper was motivated by the liquid level control in the industrial coke fractionation tower, where due to complex process behavior, uncertainties and numerous disturbances, traditional control strategies generally have limited performance on process set-point tracking, input/output disturbance rejections, measurement noise responses, etc. This paper suggests a new approach using an improved state-space model predictive control (MPC) and a P control to improve the aforementioned performance. In this paper, we model the process through the practical step-response test. We then show that this simple model can be used to design a state-space form of MPC, which allows the regulation of both the process tracking error and the weighting of output changes, resulting in improved control performance compared with conventional MPC methods. The implementation of the proposed can be extended to practical processes where control configuration can be provided, for example, the monitor computer, a distributed control systems (DCS) and corresponding instruments.
