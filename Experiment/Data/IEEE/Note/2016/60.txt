In the last years, reducing health carecosts while providing high-quality health care services became acritical issue, and hence the necessity to make available to healthcare practitioners a decision support system for determiningan optimal resources allocation. In this paper, we developa simulation-based optimization framework that combines asimulation model reproducing the main processes of a specifichospital ward with a multiobjective optimization algorithm inorder to find an approximate optimal resources allocation. Theproposed approach can be used in practice by decision makersin order to adjust the allocation of resources in a given ward.The results obtained on a real obstetrics ward of an Italianhospital show that the proposed approach is viable in practiceand allows practitioners to adopt the best strategy accordingto specific indicators related to clinical risk, quality of the careprovided, economical benefits both for patients, hospitals, andfor the National Health Service.
