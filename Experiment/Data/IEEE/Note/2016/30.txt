WCE is a new technology to review the digestive tract diseases especially for the small intestine. But the largeamount of video data produced in each examination is a majorproblem for its further application, motivating the design of a computer-aided detection system for different diseases in WCE images. We present an automatic polyp WCE image detection schemewith bag of features and textural features. Results from comprehensive comparison experiments suggest that the proposed computer-aided polyp detection system achieve better classification accuracy. This work also can support other related disease detectionapplications.
