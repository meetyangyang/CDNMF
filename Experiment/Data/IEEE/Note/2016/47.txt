This work presents an intelligent universal remote control system for home appliances. A smart phoneequipped with infrared (IR) capabilities is easier to realize functions of the Point-n-Press remote controller (PPRC). Otherwise,some IR universal serial bus (USB) dongles that can providesupport for Android operation system are considered to be used.In addition, several open source universal plug and play (UPnP)libraries are useful to help us to greatly reduce the developmenttime. Finally, for implementation of the Point-n-Press control box(PPCB), the design of the small and narrow hole is a trick for theIR mechanism. According to the design of this mechanism, onlyone device can be simultaneously pointed and controlled by theproposed control system. Therefore, the proposed control systemalways displays one control user interface of a single device. Thesedetails help us to achieve the purposes of the intelligent universalremote control system for home appliances.
