This paper analyzes the control problem of switching offâ€“on a machine tool for energy saving during the idle times. Different control policies are investigated pointing out the most significant factors. A mapping of the optimal control for an N-Policy, as a function of start-up time and mean part arrival time, is also provided. The results of this research will be useful for a practical implementation of a switching policy for energy saving when the possibility to hold parts in the buffer is considered as an additional information. This implementation requires the fitting of the distribution modeling, the part arrival times at the buffer, the fitting of the processing time, and warm-up time distributions. Moreover, it needs the estimation of the power consumed by holding parts in the buffer, and the estimation of the power adsorbed by the machine in four different states.
