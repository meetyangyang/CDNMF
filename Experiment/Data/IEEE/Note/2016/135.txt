New robot technology enables reliable operation of two independent arms in cluster tools. Its operational flexibility has significant potential for tool productivity gain. Our results identify when the two independent arms are better and how their flexibility can be fully utilized. Optimal scheduling methods for the two independent arms are also given. Based on our results, tool vendors, engineers, and fabs should consider adoption of the new tool architecture.
