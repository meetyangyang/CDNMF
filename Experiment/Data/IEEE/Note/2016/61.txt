This paper addresses the problem ofplanning shunting operations and sizing rail networks in seaports.This problem is faced by defining a dynamical model and anassociated optimization problem, in which the movements of railcars inside a port rail network are described, both for the importand the export flow. In the considered problem, many importantand realistic aspects are modeled in detail, such as arrivals anddepartures of scheduled trains, sharing of locomotives amongdifferent areas of the network, number and capacity of differentresources in the system, and so on. In this paper, the applicationto a real case study of an Italian port rail network is discussed,showing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Thanksto the general approach provided in this paper, this planningprocedure could be applied to other real cases worldwide.
