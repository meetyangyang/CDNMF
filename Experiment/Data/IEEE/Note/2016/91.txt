Recently, more and more research on attitude control for spacecraft system have been developed. Most existing controllers, however, include some disadvantages such as infinite-time convergence rate, high sensitivity to external disturbances and inertial uncertainties, low control accuracy, enforcing the upper bound of uncertainties, two implicit assumptions that there are no faults for the spacecraft actuators and they are able to provide any requested joint torque. To overcome these drawbacks, an AFTSMCL has been proposed in this paper. In addition, the proposed AFTSMCL can also avoid chattering and singularity problems and obtain the relationships among finite settling time, convergence region and actuators saturations and faults, which can be consulted by engineers in practice. Simulations of measurement frequency, robustness, fault-tolerant control ability and actuator saturations have been analyzed to provide theoretical basis for a reliable practical application of fast and high-precise attitude control operations. In future researches, we will extend the result in this paper to a case where the angular velocity is unmeasurable, and detailed analysis of tracking performances when the actuator is saturated and/or actuator failure is near to zero will be considered.
