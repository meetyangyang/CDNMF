This paper is motivated to develop an automatic assembly system to assemble two components in the size of mm level with an interference fit in 3-D space with 6 DOFs. The assembly process is divided into two stages: aligning and insertion. In the aligning stage, the orientation is first aligned with the adjusting platform and then the position is aligned with the manipulator according to the errors measured by the microscopic cameras. In the insertion stage, the contact force is introduced to precisely adjust the relative positions in and directions to protect the components and ensure the assembly quality. The developed system with the proposed methods can automatically assemble the two components successfully.
