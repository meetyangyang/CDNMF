This work analyzes the energy structure of the production line which consists of two parts: the static component (energy utilized during the production of parts) and the dynamic component (energy wasted due to downtime events). New sustainable manufacturing performance indicators are developed that are capable of correctly identifying the energy inefficiencies of a manufacturing line. These indicators are different than the present indices used in practice because they utilize readily available, real sensor information such as buffer level, machine speed, etc. The indicators do not simply use energy consumption per part, which is the standard in the manufacturing industry. Rather, they further analyze the energy structure to correctly identify energy waste. The current method fails to provide the plant manager with accurate information to determine the least energy efficient machine. Our method provides the floor manager with the proper quantitative tools for decision making. Simulation studies are performed using Simulink/MATLAB to show the robustness of these new indicators as well as the limitations of current indices. These indicators, which can be used with minimal up front cost and effort since all the information utilized is readily available, provide a valuable resource for plant managers when determining inefficiencies in the manufacturing plant.
