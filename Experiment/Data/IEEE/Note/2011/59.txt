This work was motivated by the problemof automatic detection of delamination inside a bridge deck.Nowadays, to generate the final bridge condition report fromGPR data still relies on experienced civil engineers’ excessiveintervention and scan-by-scan processing. Therefore, the currentmethod is both time and labor-consuming. Moreover, it has limited reproducibility and is subject to an operator’s variability.This work presents a new approach to automatically generate thebridge deterioration report. It derives mathematical equations tofit the rebar shape in GPR images and applies the results to realdata. The rebar inside the bridge deck can be detected accuratelyin spite of the low signal-to-noise ratio and low contrast. The finaldeterioration map is then generated based on the corroded rebar detection results automatically. This work is already tested andused in a real bridge in New Jersey, U.S.A.
