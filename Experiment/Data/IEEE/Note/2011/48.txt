Our results will be useful in all resourceallocation problems that involve gathering of information privately held by strategic users, where the utilities are any concavefunction of the allocations, and where the resource planner isnot interested in maximizing revenue, but in efficient sharingof the resource. Such situations arise quite often in fair sharingof internet resources, fair sharing of funds across departmentswithin the same parent organization, auctioning of public goods,etc. We study methods to achieve near budget balance by firstcollecting payments according to the celebrated VCG mechanism,and then returning as much of the collected money as rebates. Ourfocus on linear rebate functions allows for easy implementation.The resulting convex optimization problem is solved via relaxationto a randomized linear programming problem, for which severalefficient solvers exist. This relaxation is enabled by constraintsampling. Keeping practitioners in mind, we identify the numberof samples that assures a desired level of “near-feasibility” withthe desired confidence level. Our methodology will occasionallyrequire subsidy from outside the system. We however demonstratevia simulation that, if the mechanism is repeated several timesover independent instances, then past surplus can support thesubsidy requirements. We also extend our results to situationswhere the strategic users’ utility functions are not known to theallocating entity, a common situation in the context of internetusers and other problems.
