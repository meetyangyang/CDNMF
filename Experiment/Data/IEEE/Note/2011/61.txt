This paper shows how one can determine the optimal sequence in a two-machine-one-buffer serial line based on indicators,which are simple functions of the productivity and quality parameters ofthe machines and the capacity of the buffer. It demonstrates that the machine with higher efficiency and/or lower quality should be placed upstreamto maximize the throughput. Finally, it shows that if the buffer is sufficientlylarge, then the machine with higher efficiency should always be placed upstream regardless of the quality performance of the machines.
