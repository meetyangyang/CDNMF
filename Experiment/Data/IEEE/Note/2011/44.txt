This paper is motivated by our collaboration with the Neurovascular Department of a French universityteaching hospital in order to reduce the Length of Stay (LoS) ofstroke patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinationsare crucial for diagnosis of stroke patients but rely on heavily usedMRI facilities shared among all medical units. Starting from thisproblem, this paper proposes a general decision model for capacityreservation of critical resources from the perspective of a givenclass of customers by contracting the capacity. The contract is composed of three parts: contracted time slots (CTSs) reserved by theservice provider for the class of customers, advance cancellation ofCTSs, and request for regular time slots (RTSs). An optimizationapproach combining Markov Decision Process and local optimization is proposed. Numerical results show that advance CTS cancellation significantly reduces the ratio of unused CTS with slightincrease of customer waiting time.
