The paired robot architecture presentedhere was inspired by aircraft wing box assembly, where two end-effectors, (one inside and the other outside), must be coordinated totightly clamp a skin panel and perform precision drilling and fixingoperations. This paper aims to automate this process with pairedmobile robots that transport and align the two end-effectors anywhere on the aircraft wing. This will eliminate the need for scaffoldand fixtures to support the end-effectors, since the paired mobilerobots are attached directly to the aircraft body and position theend-effectors at desired locations.This paper presents the necessary analysis to be performed whenapplying this dual robot concept. We show how much force is necessary to support the paired robots against gravity and perform locomotion and fine positioning. We show that a special permanentarrangement, called the Halbach array, allows us to generate sufficient forces. We further discuss the complications of eddy currents,friction, and the whole system dynamics. It is shown that a prototype paired robot system can generate 1000 N of attractive forceand achieve high positioning accuracy of less than 100 um of error.Potential applications include tank or pipe inspection, shipbuilding, or general sheet metal manufacturing processes.
