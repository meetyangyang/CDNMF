Back to back batching machines withthe time window constraints are easily found in a semiconductormanufacturing process. Offline scheduler, producing a completeschedule before the actual execution taking several minutes ormore, often fails to survive from such an ever-changing environment of semiconductor manufacturing business. In practice,the ingredient to succeed in scheduling systems is not only thequality of the decisions, but also the speed of execution. Real-timedispatcher known as RTD seems to be the best-fit method in thisbusiness to handle the high volume of job reservation transactionsat any second plus various unpredictable system disturbances.The motivation of this paper is to provide practical solutions fora diffusion semiconductor manufacturing operations, aiming togenerate an efficient solution in real-time by using the hybridmethod of RTD and offline schedule. The result of the experiments demonstrates that the proposed heuristic approach ideallycombines quality and speed.
