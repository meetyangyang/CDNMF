The motivation of our paper is to simultaneously resolve the warehouse selection/location and the fleetrouting and scheduling problem for emergency material delivery.Currently, most research work reported in the literatures foremergency material supply problem focuses on either location-allocation problem or fleet routing and scheduling problem. In manypractical applications, these two types of problems have to be synergistically considered and solved for timely material delivery.Since the problem is NP-hard, it is extremely difficult to solve bygeneral integer programming methods. A new method based onthe successive subproblem solving scheme is developed to solvethis problem. The near optimal solution is obtained systematicallyby adding the once relaxed constraints back into the dual problem successively in feasibility iterations with convergence proof. Thenumerical testing results show that the new method can solvelarge-scale problems with satisfactory duality gaps and is muchmore efficient than general integer programming methods
