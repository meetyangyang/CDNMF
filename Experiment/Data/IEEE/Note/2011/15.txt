Because of the complexity of short-termscheduling for oil refinery processes, it lacks effective techniquesand software tools for practical applications. This paper presentsa unique methodology for the short-term scheduling problemof crude oil operations. By studying this problem in a controltheory perspective, schedulability conditions are developed byconsidering all constraints, some of which are ignored by a mathematical programming method. With the schedulability conditions,a detailed short-term schedule can be easily found. Thus, it can beapplied to solve industrial-size problems.
