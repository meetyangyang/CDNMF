This research is motivated by the problemabout how to generate intersection-free offset surfaces from ageneral freeform model bounded by triangular mesh surfaces.Current commercial 3D/2D Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems cannot support the offsettingoperation on a general freeform 3D model. This paper presentsa new approach which considers the problem in a differentmanner. First, the offset surfaces are sampled into an implicitrepresentation â€“ a narrowband signed distance-field. Second, thedistance-field is contoured into an intersection-free mesh surfacethat gives the approximated offset surface. The approach can beintegrated into commercial CAD/CAM systems to enrich theiroffsetting functions which are widely used in various CAD/CAMapplications, such as filleting, rounding and hollowing of 3Dmodels, tolerance and clearance analysis for assembly, coordinatemeasuring machines (CMM), tool path generation for 3D numerically controlled (NC) machining, and robot path planning.
