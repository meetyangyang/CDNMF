Even though SPSA and SFA have been devised in the literature for continuous optimization problems, ourresults indicate that they can be powerful techniques even whenthey are adapted to discrete optimization settings. OCBA is widelyrecognized as one of the most powerful methods for discrete optimization when the parameter sets are of small or moderate size.On a setting involving a parameter set of size 100, we observe thatwhen the computing budget is small, both SPSA and OCBA showsimilar performance and are better in comparison to SFA, however,as the computing budget is increased, SPSA and SFA show betterperformance than OCBA. Both our algorithms also show good performance when the parameter set has a size of . SFA is seen toshow the best overall performance. Unlike most other DPSO algorithms in the literature, an advantage with our algorithms is thatthey are easily implementable regardless of the size of the parameter sets and show good performance in both scenario
