The complexity of optimal scheduling ofmulticluster tools comes from cluster interactions. In this paper,we present a minimal cycle time calculation algorithm for a treelike multicluster tool. For widely used serially-connected clustertools, we provide an analytical formulation for computing the minimal cycle time under a given schedule. For practical applications,we present the conditions under which scheduling the multiclustertool can be decomposed into scheduling multiple single clusters. Arobot pull schedule can then be applied to each single cluster toolto obtain the minimal cycle time. We demonstrate the applicationof the algorithms and analyses using a chemical-mechanical planarization polisher example.
