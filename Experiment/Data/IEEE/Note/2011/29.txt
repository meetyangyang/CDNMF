This paper was motivated by the problemof requirement of separate wheel truing mechanism in ELIDgrinding. In this paper, we mathematically characterize the wheeldressing mechanism in ELID grinding. A controller was designedand developed based on the model to implement a new wheeltruing technique which eliminates any need of extra wheel truingdevice. Extensive simulation study and physical experimentssuggest that this approach of wheel truing is feasible and mucheffective for ELID grinding.
