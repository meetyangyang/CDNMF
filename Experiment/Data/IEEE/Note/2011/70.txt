Decentralization and competition aremajor emerging themes in resource planning and scheduling.A supply chain, for example, is inherently decentralized, wheredecision makers are drawn from different companies which maycompete with one another. Hence, a mechanism needs to be designed to ensure proper coordination among decision makers suchthat the overall system performance would be optimized. In thispaper, we propose an enhanced iterative combinatorial auctionapproach based on general equilibrium to tackle a decentralizedmultimachine flow-shop scheduling problem. The major challengeof this work is in attaining price convergence quickly therebyachieving computational efficiency. To this end, we propose twoideas for rapid price convergenceâ€”through the use of utilitypricing (from micro-economics) and variable step size (from control theory). We show that we can solve large-scale decentralizedflow-shop problems with drastic improvement in computationalperformance with little compromise on solution quality.
