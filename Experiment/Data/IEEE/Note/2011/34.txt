Siphon-based deadlock control (SBDC)prevents siphons from becoming unmarked by adding monitors toproblematic siphons. Siphon is a structure object or a set of places.Once it becomes empty of tokens, it stays so, and all output transitions of places in the siphon become permanently dead. The controller region (CR) may include unmarked places disturbing moreon the uncontrolled model and thus is less permissive than the FBMmethod whose CR covers only marked places and is the most permissive method to synthesize controllers with no weighted control(WC) arcs. However, monitors for the same siphon may be mergedinto one without losing states. Thus, the SBDC method employsfewer monitors than the FBM one but reaches fewer states. Thispaper develops the theory to uncover this secret and improve bothmethods.
