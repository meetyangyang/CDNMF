The works presented in this paper aremotivated by the need of high performances systems dedicatedto pick-transport-and-place tasks and their control. These tasksare one of the main base of the microassembly and micromanipulation applications. While pick-and-place tasks were successfullyperformed with classical microgrippers, they were very rarelyautomated. This is mainly due to the fact that automation inthe micro/nanoworld is a new issue and the litterature only concerns the local control of microactuators and microrobots forthe moment. Furthermore, existing microgrippers are limitedto small range of positioning, making them hardly adapted forpick-and-place for large distance.The core of this paper is to fulfil the requirement of highrange, high resolution, and controlled microgrippers. For that,a microgripper based on a combination of the thermal andthe piezoelectric actuations is developed. To improve the positioning accuracy and to control the manipulation force duringa pick-and-place task, a new control scheme adapted for theactuators of the new microgripper is proposed. It is noticed thatthe proposed control scheme can also be applied to classicalmicrogrippers as it is a generalization.
