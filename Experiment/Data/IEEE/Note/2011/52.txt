A compact way of modeling event-drivensystems is to use state-variables, instead of an explicit enumeration of the states. This paper uses such a model for representingthe system to be controlled as well as its desired behaviors, and develops a symbolic approach, that avoids explicit enumeration of thestate-space, for control synthesis. The contribution is the symboliccomputation of a safe (avoids reaching forbidden states) and nonblocking (avoids getting blocked at non final states) controller thatis also maximal (permits all safe and nonblocking behaviors). Theresults are illustrated via a simple manufacturing system.
