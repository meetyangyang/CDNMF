The non-wet identification system forsolder joints is immediately applicable to all types of PCB sockets. A 2D X-ray machine was set up to hold PCB boards and programmed to image each socket needing inspection. The X-raycollector was set at 45 and the socket was rotated to 45 , 135 ,225 , and 315 . At each rotation a complete set of images wastaken of the outer edge of the socket by moving the PCB board inthe x and y directions under the X-ray source. These images areinput by the software and analyzed and the results displayed to theoperator for action. The algorithms were programmed using theIntel® Integrated Performance Primitives and Intel® Math KernelLibrary. The code was then embedded in a C++ program. Thecode performance was multithreaded and optimized using Intel®Threading Building Blocks and Intel® Parallel Studio. A userinterface was coded and used to display the images processed bythe algorithm and found to have a suspect joint. Only the imagescontaining a suspect joint are displayed for the operator to savetime. The suspect joints are labeled with an “x” on the displayedimage. The operator can click on the suspect joint and the imagewill move to a zoom window where the image will be availablefor zooming. The exact label of the joint is also displayed to theoperator. Images of the joint at the four different angles are alsodisplayed on the interface as are sample defects for the operatorto compare to the current image. There is an input mechanismfor selecting defective and non-defective joints in the image. Afterprocessing for the image has been completed, defect parametricdata is stored into a file. A screen shot of the interface is providedin Fig. A.
