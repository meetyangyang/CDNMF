This paper was motivated by the problemof online parameter optimization for robotic assembly applicationsin which the mechanical joining of components must be completedboth quickly and gently. Traditional approaches for such optimizations require offline modeling or user-specified tests involving trialand-error or design of experiments due to the inherent risks ofdamaging the robots, tools, or components. We propose a methodof automating and enhancing the optimization process by applyingand hybridizing machine learning practices. Through the utilization of both unsupervised learning methods and dynamic numerical model building and analysis, a robotic system can tune its operational parameters and effectively prune a potentially infiniteparameter space of inefficient or dangerous values. These modelscan be algorithmically analyzed in order to monitor their quality,and predict whether or not they stand to benefit the optimizationprocess.
