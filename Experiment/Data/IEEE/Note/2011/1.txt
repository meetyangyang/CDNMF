The main challenge in scheduling multicluster tools in semiconductor manufacturing is to handle thecluster interactions. These interactions create phenomena that donot exist in single-cluster tools. This paper presents an analyticaland algorithmic solution for scheduling two-cluster tools with constant robot moving times. The analysis and results presented inthis paper provide foundations to solve optimal scheduling of multicluster tools that will be discussed in the companion paper. Wepropose a resource-based method to analyze the cycle time androbot schedule of multicluster tools. The advantage of such an approach is its effective and efficient treatment to capture the complex schedules among various modules and wafers. The interaction dependencies among two clusters are revealed by the resourcebased analysis and scheduling algorithms are also presented. Weillustrate the proposed analysis and algorithms through severalexamples.
