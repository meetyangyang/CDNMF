The central message from this paper is that whenusing heterogeneous sensor systems, the commonly used -out-of- decision fusion rule is no longer optimal. This has important implications forsecurity surveillance applications because a complex surveillance sensorsystem almost always comprises multiple units of different types of sensors. Under those circumstances, a more flexible format of decision fusionshould be allowed. Our paper presents a new optimal decision rule and aprocedure to determine it. Information required for using this proposed decision rule includes the cost factors related to sensors and consequences ofmaking wrong decisions, as well as the prior belief of how likely an adverseevent would take place.
