In an RFID system, packet collisions can occurwhen multiple tags transmit a reply message simultaneously in response tothe query message from the reader. In this paper, we present an analytical model for frame slotted ALOHA-based anticollision protocol in RFIDsystems. Using this model, the optimal frame length, which results in themaximum channel efficiency, can be determined for ALOHA-based RFIDsystems. The EPCglobal standard has recommended using dynamic frameslotted ALOHA for RFID applications. Therefore, the proposed analyticalmodel is useful for engineers and developers to implement dynamic framelength ALOHA algorithms for RFID systems. In addition to improving thechannel efficiency, the proposed analytical model can be used for designingmore reliable RFID systems from the privacy and security point-of-view.
