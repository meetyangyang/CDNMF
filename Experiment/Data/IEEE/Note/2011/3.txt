Semiconductor manufacturers often seekmethods to increase the productivity of their cluster tools. Thispaper considers the option of adding single-unit-capacity input andoutput buffers at each processing chamber of a cluster tool with adual gripper robot. We demonstrate that this is an effective approach for tools that are transport-bound, i.e., those in which therobot is the bottleneck resource. We also present a sequence ofrobot movements that provides the optimum throughput for sucha tool. The use of these internal buffers is not beneficial for toolsthat are process-bound, i.e., those in which a processing chamberis the bottleneck.
