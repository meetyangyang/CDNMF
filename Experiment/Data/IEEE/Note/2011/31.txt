As a new information-capturing technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is being widelybelieved to be the next great solution to supply chain management.A wide adoption of RFID across the supply chain will bring significant benefits, such as improved inventory accuracy, and increasedvisibility of stock. However, how to value these benefits remainschallenging. In a broader perspective, if we regard manufacturingas one node along the supply chain, then RFID also allows retailersto closely monitor the movement of their orders throughout theirsupply chains, from suppliers to freight forwarders, to ports andocean carriers, and finally to distribution centers. Without thisinformation, which corresponds to the situation where no RFIDis used, the system may operate as if there is no information onthe status of the production process. This paper proposes a modelwhich may eventually be developed into a solution for assessing therevenue (or gross profit) that is derived without the informationon the production status and the revenue (or gross profit) thatis derived from such information that would be brought about through the use of RFID. The difference between the revenue(or gross profit) in the two situations can then help solidify thequantification of the value of RFID.
