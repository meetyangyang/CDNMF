The major motivation of this researchis to develop a robust and flexible surface flattening technology,which can help sheet manufacturing industries to obtain planarpieces for fabrication of products. For example, in garment industry, after automatically designing a user customized suit in 3-Daccording to the scanned human body (Wang et al., 2005; Wang etal., 2007), it is very important to keep the length invariant on thepredefined feature curves so as to keep the fitness after sewing the2-D pieces together. Moreover, the boundaries of two neighboringpatches should have the same length to prevent unwanted wrinkleswhen they are sewn together. Other mesh parameterization (andsurface flattening) algorithms like Levy et al., 2002; Sheffer et al.,2005; and Liu et al.2008 cannot exactly control the lengths offeature curves during the flattening; thus, they are not suitablefor the aforementioned applications. WireWarping (Wang, 2008)can flatten 3-D mesh surface into planar pieces, while strictlykeeping the lengths of all feature curves and boundaries; however,it generates large unstable distortions on those highly nondevelopable 3-D surfaces. The new approach presented in this paper,WireWarping++, develops a more flexible flattening technology to obtain better 2-D shapes by controlling the length variation in aspecified range on the elastic feature curves. We have tested theimplementation of the WireWarping++ approach on patches ofwetsuit sets and jeans pants. We have also applied the prototypesystem to toy and furniture design. In all these applications,WireWarping++ shows significant improvements on the quality ofresults.
