Wafer spatial variations study is criticalto within-wafer control and optimization. Only through investigation of the spatial variations on the wafer surface do we get to learnmore about the nature of the semiconductor process/equipmentand the manufacturability of certain circuit design patterns. In thispaper, we propose a novel analysis tool to help engineers characterize the wafer spatial variations and distinguish the systematicvariation from the random variation. With the spatial systematicvariations identified and described, the engineers can discover theopportunities to further improve the processing quality and thusthe final yield.
