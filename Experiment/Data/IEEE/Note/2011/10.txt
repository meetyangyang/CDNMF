Formulas are provided to compute the expectedtotal die losses over product lifetimes due to excursions in process andequipment that are not detected until end-of-line testing, given the processstep, probability of occurrence and kill rate for each potential excursion,given the manufacturing cycle times, and given assumptions about baselineyield and yield learning rate. Formulas also are provided to compute theexpected lifetime revenue losses from such excursions, given an assumedrate of price decline for die output. The impact of cycle time reduction ondie output and revenue may be readily assessed using the formulas.
