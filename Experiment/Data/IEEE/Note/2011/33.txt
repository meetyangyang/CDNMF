Petri nets are used to model and analyzedynamical systems, such as manufacturing systems, transportationsystems, and communication systems. As the size and complexityof these widespread systems increase due to higher integration andmarket penetration, it is important to develop efficient state andevent estimation approaches for the purposes of monitoring andfault diagnosis. This paper studies event estimation in systems thatare modeled by labeled Petri nets. The problem is challenging because two different types of uncertainty might arise due to sensorlimitations: (i) occurrences of different activity (namely, the firingsof different transitions) may generate the same observation and(ii) unobservable activity (transitions) may not generate any observation. By associating to each activity (transition) a measure ofits viability or execution cost, we develop an algorithm that is ableto estimate the least-cost (most likely) transition firing sequenceas long as unobservable transitions have strictly positive costs and form an acyclic unobservable subnet. When unobservable transitions are contact-free, the complexity of the proposed algorithm ispolynomial in the length of the sequence of observations. As we illustrate in this paper, the approach is useful for a variety of eventestimation problems in many practical systems including, for example, planning sequence estimation in manufacturing systems.
