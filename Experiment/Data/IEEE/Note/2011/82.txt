FDA is an important generalization of multiresource generalized assignment problem, where customers are flexible intheir order size. Manufacturers need to determine the optimal size for eachitem for maximizing the profit. Here, we consider FDA with addition of:1) choosing a set of orders from a large set of available orders and 2) setuptime between operations of two consecutive orders. As a special case, we formulate the assignment of UAVs as an FDA. The formulation significantlyreduces the size of the problem compared to some recent published results.It allows more efficient way to solve the problems.
