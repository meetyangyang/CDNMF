Motivated by the need for a cost-effective method to replace conventional flow rig calibration of largeelectromagnetic flowmeters (EMFs), which adds considerably tothe product cost, this paper presents an efficient method for improving dry calibration (requiring no actual liquid). This methodadaptively determines the points for taking measurements on theboundary surfaces to reconstruct the magnetic field distribution(MFD), and has been experimentally verified on two widely usedfluid-to-electrical transducers. As demonstrated experimentallyand compared against published data based on gradient method,the adaptive method greatly reduces the number of measurementsand length of the scanning route. In addition, the effect of measurement noise on the accuracy of the adaptive method has beeninvestigated on a spherical motor, which illustrates the flexibility to include a least-square fit for filtering measurement noise. Whilethe reconstruction method illustrated here is in the context ofelectromagnetic fields, the procedure introduced in this paper canbe extended to other physical field (such as thermal and electrical)based mechatronic systems, as long as the field obeys similargoverning equations (such as Laplace and Poisson equations) withmeasurable boundary conditions.
