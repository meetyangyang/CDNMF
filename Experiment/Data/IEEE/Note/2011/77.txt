Structured light is a useful tool for automation application areas where 3D geometry needs to be determined, from factory lines to medical procedures. Considering assembly line uses, scanning may need to be performed in tight, constrained areas. Calibration in such areas with existing methodscan be difficult, as specific occluding bodies such as equipment areoften required to be placed in specific locations within the area, andthese occluding bodies may be too large or too awkward to maneuver as required. Similar constraints apply to the medical field.If a system were to be used to keep track of a patient’s body surface, calibration can again be difficult as medical facilities oftenhave built-in equipment that cannot simply be moved whenever asystem needs to be calibrated. In both cases, calibration of structured light systems must be possible in the scene where they will beused, without requiring known geometry of the scene’s constituentoccluding bodies. The method discussed in this paper is designedfor precisely these situations.
