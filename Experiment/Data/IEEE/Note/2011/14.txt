Many manufacturing systems such as theproduction of key components of aircrafts require large storagespaces and efficient material handling resources. This paper proposes a general scheduling model that extends job-shop schedulingmodels to incorporate important features of real manufacturingsystems. More precisely, each operation can be performed in different modes and requires a different set of resources depending onthe mode. Further, we consider blocking constraints that requiresto hold resources used for an operation until resources needed forthe next operation of the same job are available. An efficient approach combining a novel geometric approach for the two-job caseand metaheuristics is proposed. Extensive numerical experimentation proves the efficiency of our approach.
