In this paper, searching an unknown region togather information about it is modeled as a problem of using search asa means of reducing information uncertainty about the region. Moreover,multiple automated searchers or agents are used to carry out this operationoptimally. This problem has many applications in search and surveillanceoperations using several autonomous UAVs or mobile robots. The conceptof agents converging to the centroid of their Voronoi cells, weighted with theuncertainty density, is used to design a search strategy named as sequential deploy and search. Finally, the performance of the strategy is validatedusing simulations.
