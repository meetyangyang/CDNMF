This paper presents scheduling techniques for DMFS, a new class of lab-on-a-chip devices. Thesechips execute chemical analyses by moving, mixing, and splittingdroplets of different chemicals. Our primary goal is to automateand optimize the scheduling of droplet input, mixing, and outputoperations to minimize the completion time of DMFS applications.This paper presents new scheduling algorithms that are efficient,easy to implement, and proven to be optimal in completion time.The algorithms exploit the full binary tree structure of biochemicalanalyses to minimize the completion time. To develop cost-efficientbiochips, we present algorithms that reduce the required resources(e.g., mixers, storage units) on DMFS chips to complete the biochemical analyses. Our scheduling algorithms when combinedwith droplet routing algorithms can create completely automatedsoftware controllers for DMFS.
