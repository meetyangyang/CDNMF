In todayâ€™s industry, the control functionsare implemented to a great extent manually, which makes it atedious, error-prone, and time consuming process. supervisorycontrol theory (SCT) provides a powerful framework for automatically producing safe and flexible control functions. SCT is basedon state-transition models, however, industrial people are used toother representations. Specifically, the interpretation of a controlfunction represented by a huge and cluttered state-transitionmodel requires the maintenance personnel to have other skillsthan are common today. As a consequence, SCT is seldom utilizedin the industry. This paper aims to facilitate the realization andmanipulation of control functions that are generated based onSCT. This is performed by restricting the state-transition modelsby tractable logic conditions extracted from the generated control function. To be able to handle large systems efficiently, thecomputations are carried out on implicit representations of thestate-transition models.
