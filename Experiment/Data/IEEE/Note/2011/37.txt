In many practical industrial processes such as injection molding process, improving the generalization ability of predictionmodel is a hot topic. In this study, Bagging and NCCD algorithm is combined and a selection-based strategy is proposed to improve the generalization ability. Good performance is obtained by using the proposed SNCCDBAGG algorithm to predict injection molding process parameters andproduct quality. Since the Bagging algorithm is part of the approach, it canbe used even there is not much training data available. The individual NNin the ensemble can be different network model such as back propagationneural network (BPNN), radial basis functions (RBFs) and heterogeneousnetworks. The parameters of the algorithm can be decided by using themethods in this study.
