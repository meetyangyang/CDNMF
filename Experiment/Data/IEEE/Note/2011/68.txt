In the futuristic military and civilian applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, patrol, oil spill,etc., a swarm of UAVs can be deployed to carry out the missionfor information collection. These UAVs have limited sensor andcommunication ranges. In order to enhance the performance ofthe mission and to complete the mission quickly, cooperation between UAVs is important. Designing cooperative search strategiesfor multiple UAVs with these constraints is a difficult task. Apartfrom this, another requirement in the hostile territory is to minimize communication while making decisions. This adds furthercomplexity to the decision-making algorithms.In this paper, a self-assessment-based decision-making scheme,for multiple UAVs performing a search mission, is proposed. Theagents make their decisions based on the information acquiredthrough their sensors and by cooperation with neighbors. Thecomplexity of the decision-making scheme is very low. It can arriveat decisions fast with low communication overheads, while accommodating various information structures used for increasingthe fidelity of the uncertainty maps. Theoretical results provingcompleteness of the algorithm and the lower and upper bounds onthe search time are also provided.
