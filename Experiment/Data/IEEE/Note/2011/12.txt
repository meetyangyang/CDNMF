In recent times, social networks have received a high level of attention due to their proven ability in improving the performance of web search, recommendations in collaborative filtering systems, spreading a technology in the marketusing viral marketing techniques, etc. It is well known that theinterpersonal relationships (or ties or links) between individualscause change or improvement in the social system because the decisions made by individuals are influenced heavily by the behaviorof their neighbors. An interesting and key problem in social networks is to discover the most influential nodes in the social network which can influence other nodes in the social network in astrong and deep way. This problem is called the target set selection problem and has two variants: 1) the top- nodes problem,where we are required to identify a set of influential nodes thatmaximize the number of nodes being influenced in the network and2) the -coverage problem which involves finding a set of influentialnodes having minimum size that can influence a given percentageof the nodes in the entire network. There are many existing algorithms in the literature for solving these problems. In this paper,we propose a new algorithm which is based on a novel interpretation of information diffusion in a social network as a cooperative game. Using this analogy, we develop an algorithm based onthe Shapley value of the underlying cooperative game. The proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms ofgenerality or computational complexity or both. Our results arevalidated through extensive experimentation on both syntheticallygenerated and real-world data sets.
