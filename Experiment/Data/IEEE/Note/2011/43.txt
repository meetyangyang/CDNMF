The motivation of the present work is todesign an IS for use by decision makers both in ITN offline planning and real-time management. To specify the IS, the paper proposes a closed-loop management structure based on a referencemodel describing the IS structure and behavior and a simulationmodule that foresees the system dynamics. The IS provides the ITNdesigners with important key features. First, the IS can detect thebottlenecks of the system and evaluate the performance of alternative middle term solutions. Second, based on modern ICT tools,the IS can enable the decision makers to update some operationaldesign parameters in a real-time closed-loop strategy. Future research aims at specifying the decision and control modules of theIS structure to design a decision support system based on the presented metamodeling framework.
