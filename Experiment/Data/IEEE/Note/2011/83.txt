Long-term scheduling of cascaded hydro energy systems is an important planning activity in the reservoir management and electric industry. This paper formulates a long-term scheduling problem for cascaded hydro energy systems with annual water consumption and release constraints as a finite horizon CMDP, and develops a new rollout algorithm to deal with the large problem size. Motivated by a practical project on Yellow River in north China, this work has extended applicability since the new algorithm can start with any feasible policies currently used in practical systems and improve their performance. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the formulation and the new algorithm.
