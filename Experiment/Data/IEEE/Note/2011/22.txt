Motivated by the requirement of developing a decoupled XYZ micropositioning stage for 3-Dmicro/nanomanipulation uses, a novel spatial parallel mechanism incorporating flexure hinges is presented in this paper,and piezoelectric actuators (PZTs) owning large output forceand stiffness are used for actuation. The piezo-stage has themerits of not complicated structure as well as both input andoutput decoupling properties. By input decoupling, the PZTsare isolated and protected. With output decoupling, the parallelstage behaviors like a serial one, which enables the adoption ofsingle-input-single-output (SISO) controller for each axis. Beforethe fabrication of the stage, its parameters are optimized toachieve a high resonant frequency under performance constraintsin terms of workspace size, input stiffness, and safety of material,etc. Analytical models for the above performances are derived andthe optimized stage is fabricated from Al-7075 alloy by the wireelectrical discharge machining (EDM) process for experimentaldemonstrations. The results provide a sound basis in developing an alternative piezo-stage for micro/nanoscale manipulation. Thedesign and control methodology can be extended to other types ofstages as well.
