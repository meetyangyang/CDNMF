The main advantage of the proposed protocol is to retain information obtained from a previous cycle of tagidentification, and hence skip many collisions to quickly reidentifytags. In many RFID applications where a reader may repeatedlyidentify tags, such as object tracking and locating, the proposedprotocols can reduce time of reidentifying tags. Although some current anticollision protocols such as ABS, TCFSA can reduce timeof reidentifying tags, they may not be optimal ways in reducingidentification delay. The proposed protocolâ€™s performance of identification delay can surpasses the current protocols when collidingtags increase. In addition, the proposed protocol needs to estimatetag quantity. Since many published estimates all assume that tagsdistribution should be random, they may not be applicable to theproposed protocol. The novel estimate in this paper can help engineers to adopt the proposed protocol to RFID tag identification.
