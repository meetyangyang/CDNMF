Todayâ€™s manufacturing enterprises haveto face a number of challenges in a turbulent environment thatoriginates amongst other from saturated markets, unprecedentedand abrupt changes in market demands, an ever increasingnumber of product variants and smaller lot sizes. A recent research trend in Germany is the so called Cognitive Factory, whereartificial cognitive capabilities are introduced to the control ofproduction systems. The applications range from productionplanning and control, human-robot-cooperation, automatic robotprogramming to intuitive worker guidance systems.The concept of fully automated production systems is no longera viable vision, as it has been shown, that the conventional automation is not able to deal with the ever-rising complexity of modernproduction systems. Especially, a high reactivity, agility and adaptivity that is required by modern production systems, can only bereached by human operators with their immense cognitive capabilities, which enable them to react to unpredictable situations, toplan their further actions, to learn and to gain experience and tocommunicate with others. Thus, new concepts are required, thatapply these cognitive principles to the planning processes and control systems of production systems.
