The problem of designing and deployingLES for sequential resource allocation systems is well-documentedand extensively researched in the current literature. Acknowledging the fact that the computation of the maximally permissiveLES is an NP-hard problem, most of the present solutions tend totradeoff maximal permissiveness for computational tractabilityand ease of the policy design and implementation. In this work, wedemonstrate that the maximally permissive LES can be a viablesolution for the resource allocation taking place in many practicalapplications by: (a) effectively differentiating between the offlineand online problem complexity and (b) controlling the latterthrough the development of succinct and compact representationsof the information that is necessary for the characterization of themaximal permissive LES.
