Association Link Network (ALN) aimsto establish associated relations among various resources. Byextending the hyperlink network World Wide Web to an association-rich network, ALN is able to effectively support Webintelligence activities such as Web browsing, Web knowledgediscovery and publishing, etc. Since existing methods for buildingsemantic link on Web resources cannot effectively and automatically organize loose Web resources, effective Web intelligenceactivities are still challenging. A discovery algorithm of associated resources is first proposed by us to build original ALN fororganizing loose Web resources. The properties of different typesof ALN are discussed, which show that C-ALN has good performances to support Web intelligence activities. An applicationusing C-ALN to organize Web services is presented, which showsthat C-ALN is an effective and efficient tool for building semanticlink on the resources of Web services.
