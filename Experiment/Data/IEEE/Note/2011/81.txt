Abstractâ€”Automatic train regulation (ATR) dominates theservice quality, transport capacity, and energy usage of ametro-line operation. The train regulator aims to maximizethe schedule/headway adherence while minimizing the energyconsumption. This paper presents a traffic-energy model tocharacterize the complicated dynamics with regard to the trafficand the energy consumption of a metro line, and devises anadaptive-optimal-control (AOC) algorithm to optimize the trainregulator through reinforcement learning. The updating rules forreinforcement learning are deduced from the discrete minimumprinciple. Testing with field traffic data, the AOC algorithmsucceeds in the optimization of the train regulator; no matterthe system is disturbed by passenger-flow fluctuations or byfrequently minor delays. The results also show that better trainregulation with less energy consumption is attainable through therunning-time and dwell-time controls.
