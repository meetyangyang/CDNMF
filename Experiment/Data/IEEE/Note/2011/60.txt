Abstractâ€”Pipe assembly that connects over hundreds of various pipesto mechanical structures is a fundamental challenge to complex productdevelopments. This paper presents a pipe routing algorithm for automaticgeneration of pipe assembly plans within a constrained space between innerand outer casings of an aeroengine. In this paper, pipes are first ordered inaccordance with interference degrees and other engineering rules. Then,a projection-based routing heuristic is developed to find satisfactory collision-free pipe paths in 2D or 3D spaces. Further, the heuristic is modified,by replacing projections with geodesics, to meet requirements of routingpipes on surfaces. Numerical computations of a 119 pipe routing problemare performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pipe routing algorithm.
