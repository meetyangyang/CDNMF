In the context of mass customization, it isoften difficult to evaluate advantage/disadvantage of personalization versus standardization. Thise paper provides answers to thiscritical question considering intermediate cases (different levels ofstandardization and different levels of redundancy). We considerthe selection of modules for a product family, minimizing production and transportation costs. Intermediate cases show that partial standardization of the product family leads to large benefitson the supply chain while redundancy has small impact. We cansummarize our results in a few succinct points: from an economicpoint-of-view, the standardization strategy leads to greater benefits than redundancy; the redundancy strategy is practically notinteresting except when production costs are greater than assemblycosts; the standardization strategy is much more profitable mainlywhen fixed costs are greater than variable costs; total standardization leads generally to offer very few different products exceptwhen variable costs are greater than fixed costs; when variablescosts become such higher that we can ignore fixed costs, then thebasic model, the standardization and the redundancy strategies,provides the same optimal solution.
