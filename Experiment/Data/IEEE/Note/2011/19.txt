Abstractâ€”A linear dynamic network is a system of subsystems that approximates the dynamic model of large, geographically distributed systemssuch as the power grid and traffic networks. A favorite technique to operatesuch networks is distributed model predictive control (DMPC), which advocates the distribution of decision-making while handling constraints ina systematic way. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art of DMPCof linear dynamic networks in two ways. First, it extends a baseline modelby introducing constraints on the output of the subsystems and by lettingsubsystem dynamics to depend on the state besides the control signals ofthe subsystems in the neighborhood. With these extensions, constraints onqueue lengths and delayed dynamic effects can be modeled in traffic networks. Second, this paper develops a distributed interior-point algorithmfor solving DMPC optimization problems with a network of agents, one foreach subsystem, which is shown to converge to an optimal solution. In atraffic network, this distributed algorithm permits the subsystem of an intersection to be reconfigured by only coordinating with the subsystems inits vicinity.
