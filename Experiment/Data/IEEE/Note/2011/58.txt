Biological experiments and drug screenrequire the transfer of individual zebrafish embryos into standardmultiwell microplates. Manually pipetting one and only oneembryo into each well is tedious and time consuming. Differentfrom the only commercial system for automated zebrafish embryotransfer, which is based on conventional, expensive flow cytometry,the proof-of-principle system reported in this paper utilizes a cellimmobilization device and a cooperative robotic mechanism forparallel transfer of zebrafish embryos. The system architectureand transfer techniques promise efficient, cost-effective zebrafishembryo transfer for applications requiring molecule tests on ahigh number of cells.
