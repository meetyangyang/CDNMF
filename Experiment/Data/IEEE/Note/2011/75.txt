For a supervisory controller in any AMS,two indispensable elements are observation and control unitswhich can be realized by sensors and actuators, respectively. Interms of Petri nets, they correspond to the in-going and out-goingarcs of control places. A controlled system requiring excessivesensors and actuators poses serious cost and reliability concerns.This paper presents a method to derive the supervisors withminimum cost. On the basis of this, it extends the result to timedPetri nets in order to facilitate the comprehensive evaluation ofthe control cost and system efficiency. The method is formulatedas mathematical models whose effectiveness is evaluated vianumerical experiments.
