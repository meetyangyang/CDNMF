The research work presented in this paperis to support the geometric solution for the design automation ofhuman-centered customization of freefrom products (e.g., apparelproducts, shoes, and glasses). The design automation of such products with complex geometric shapes is based on how to establishthe relationship between the product and the human body and howto maintain such a relationship. This is quite different from the design automation function provided by current commercial 3-D/2-Dcomputer-aided design (CAD) systems. A prior work presented inTrans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol. 4, issue no. 1, pp. 11–21, 2007, givesa solution to such problems. However, in that approach, the correspondences of the feature points on human bodies are interactivelyspecified by users. The algorithm proposed in this paper aims atproviding an automatic method to extract the feature points on theinput human bodies, which serves as the preprocessing step of theTrans. Autom. Sci. Eng., vol. 4, issue no. 1, pp. 11–21, 2007, in thepipeline of design automation for human-centered freeform products. On the other aspect, most of the existing cloth CAD systemsfocus on the simulation of virtual wear and do not provide the design automation function for the personal customization of apparelproducts
