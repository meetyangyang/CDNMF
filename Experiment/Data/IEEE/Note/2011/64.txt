Anyone wishing to develop a physically-based simulation of a robot, especially a biorobotic system, directly from CAD needsto address the issues we present in this paper. Our belief is that the processwe describe is generally applicable and that the issues we address (in particular, in how the CAD data is extracted and integrated into simulation) isa source for many new problems in systems integration and standards.
