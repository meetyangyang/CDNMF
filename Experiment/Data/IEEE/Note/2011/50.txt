As a matter of fact, client-server NASs arelargely used in industry and, therefore, the efforts to deal with theirperformances evaluation are necessary. In the current work, wepropose an analytic approach to evaluate their reactivity. Analyticformulae are provided to calculate directly and deterministicallythe bounds of response time along with others to assess its probability density distribution. Moreover, the results of these formulaeturn out to be complying with a lot of experimental measurementscarried out under different circumstances.
