Nanowires (NWs) have great potentials inelectronic and photonic applications due to their unique properties.The repeatability of nanowire growth, however, is low and presentsa major challenge for its mass production. Predictive modeling andcontrol method is essential to the process yield and productivityimprovement. The major difficulty of establishing such models islimited data and physical understanding of growth process. Thispaper provides a modeling approach to describe the overall NWsgrowth by modeling the weight changes over time in the growth ofNWs.
