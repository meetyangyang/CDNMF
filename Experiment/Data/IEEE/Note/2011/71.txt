This paper is motivated by a couple oftechnical barriers in multichannel CM systems, where sensorsproviding multiple, real-time CM information are subject tofailures and limited and/or asynchronous data transmission isunavoidable. These make reliable fault diagnosis and prognosisquite challenging. Therefore, a new sensor recovery method capable of handling sparse and/or asynchronous CM data becomesa value-added means to improve the robustness of a CM system.This paper provides a nonparametric sensor recovery approachand a semi-parametric alternative based on FPCA to overcomethe challenges. These approaches are more capable than widelyused alternatives, such as neural networks, in dealing with suchcomplex CM environments.
