A force-closure grasp of an object is agrasp that can resist any external force applied to the object. In thispaper, we present methods to report all force-closure grasps of aflat, curved object, using four (or fewer) hard, frictionless contacts.A naive, but time consuming approach to computing allforce-closure grasps would be to consider all possible combinations of boundary features (i.e., arcs or vertices) and for eachcompute the grasps that can be achieved by placing contacts onthose features. This wastes time by considering combinations offeatures that do not allow for force-closure grasps. We presenta method which avoids wasting time by identifying only thosecombinations of features that do admit grasps.Our method uses a series of geometric transformations to turnthe problem into finding intersections between certain geometric 5843shapes. This can be solved using methods from the field of computational geometry. One advantage of our method is that it can bemathematically proved that it will always report all possible graspswithin time limits that depend on the number of combinations ofboundary features that admit grasps, rather than the (often muchlarger) total number of combinations of features.Although we focus on computing all grasps, the same approachcan easily be extended to find an optimal grasp or grasps that meetcertain criteria.
