Our results show the intrinsic complexity of planning views for a mobile robot equipped with a range sensor. It is an important problem for automated object inspection and model building. Weformulate the problem considering both the cost of taking a view and thecost of traveling for the robot. We report two results. The first result characterizes the best solution (expressed as a ratio of the cost of the solutionfound by the algorithm to the true optimal cost, also called the approximation ratio) any polynomial time algorithm – these algorithms are oftenthe implemented ones because of practical run times, particularly for largesized problems – is able to achieve. The second result shows that a commonly used algorithm to solve the problem, the two-level decoupled algorithm, asymptotically achieves this best approximation ratio. Our result,therefore, provides a theoretical justification for the two-level algorithm.
