Since many years, the hysteresis nonlinearity inpiezoelectric micro/nanoactuators (AFM, microgrippers, etc.) has beenmoving many researchers. Despite the high resolution and the high speedof these materials, the hysteresis strongly compromises the accuracy. Iffeedback control laws could easily improve the performances, their usein micro/nanoactuators and small systems are constrained by the luck ofconvenient sensors. On the one hand, accurate and high bandwidth sensorsare very expensive and bulky (accelerometers, optical sensors). On theother hand, integrable sensors are highly sensitive to noises and are veryfragile (strain gage). To surpass the use of sensors, feedforward controltechniques have been used. These techniques represent a great interestin an integration/package point-of-view but the existing methods show acomplexity in terms of computation and implementation.Three points have motivated the works presented in this article: 1) theneed of high performances in micro/nanoactuation; 2) the shunning of theuse of bulky sensors; and 3) and the need of easily computable and implementable control techniques.The content of this paper focuses therefore on the design of a feedforwardcontroller (compensator) with a special concern on the ease of computation and implementation. Of course, even if we present an application to aspecific piezoelectric actuator, the proposed approach is also applicable toother systems whose hysteresis is modeled with the Boucâ€“Wen expression.
