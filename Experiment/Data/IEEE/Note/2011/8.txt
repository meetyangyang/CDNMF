Practical manufacturing systems are usually very complex. In order to analyze system behavior, assumptions are made to enable the analysis. A decomposition approachis commonly adopted based on an independence assumption. However, any two components in a complex manufacturing system areseldom completely independent. When there are real dependencies, we should take special care with analyses based on decomposition. This paper examines parallel batch processing and throughdetailed analysis, identifies a particular dependence and proposesan improved model that is validated through experimentation.
