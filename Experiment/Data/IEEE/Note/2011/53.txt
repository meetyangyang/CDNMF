Multisources renewable energy systemscoupled on a DC bus are not usual equipments, and experimentation with such equipments are difficult to carry out and timeconsuming. These systems are fragile (particularly the converterswhich are sensible to short circuits and surcharges), dangerouswith potential risk for the practitioners (particularly for DC buswith high-power transfers). The proposed hybrid model can beused as a numerical simulator for multisources renewable energysystems. This model is an easy and low cost tool for designing, validating and evaluating the performances of the control strategiesdeveloped for the optimization of energy transfers. Moreover, it isalso helpful in the design of the systems structure (sources numberand converters characteristics). As a consequence, it could be considered as an integrated numerical solution for the study of powermanagement. This solution is systematic and also portable with respect to the technical characteristics of the components.
