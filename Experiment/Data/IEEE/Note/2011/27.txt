In recent years, more and more researcheson spherical actuators that can achieve 2/3-DOF rotational motionsin one joint appear. Accordingly, various measurement methodsfor multi-DOF rotational motions have been proposed. However,there are some disadvantages for these methods such as existenceof friction or extra inertia moment on the rotor, low measurementresolution and high sensitivity to external environment. To overcome these drawbacks, we have proposed a 3-DOF optical orientation measurement method in this paper. It can achieve noncontacthigh-precision measurements and resistance to environmental disturbances. In the future, we will implement this method into our spherical actuator developed previously by using simple laser diodein compact package. This 3-DOF orientation measurement methodcould also be very useful for robotics, instruments, and manufacturing technology.
