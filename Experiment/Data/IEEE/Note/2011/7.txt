Clustered photolithography and multicluster tools in semiconductor manufacturing feature internalwafer buffers and setups that depend on wafer location. Thesefeatures are important to system performance when productdiversity and small wafer lots are common as in high-mix fabs andin the anticipated 450 mm fabs. Unfortunately, existing fab-levelsimulation models do not include these equipment features.We develop flow line models that allow for diverse products,wafer lots and wafer location dependent setups. The models developed can require about one order of magnitude less computationthan otherwise possible to model practical tools. In addition, themodels have given throughput and cycle time values to within1.0% and 4.0% of actual values from production clustered photolithography tools. As such, a flow line can serve to replaceexisting equipment models in fab-level simulators with reasonablecomputational cost while retaining high accuracy.
