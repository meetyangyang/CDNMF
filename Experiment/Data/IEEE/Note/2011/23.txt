In this paper, an experimental test benchis presented for the analysis of the mechanical response in car seats.It consists in a force control application in which the robot, bymeans of a dummy, must apply a controlled force on a car seat,simulating the movements of a human sitting on and standing upfrom the seat. This simulation is limited by the fact that normalized dummies used in tests are usually conceived to reproduce asitting position and do not have the mobility of the human body.Furthermore, the simulation with a six axes robot limits to six thedegrees of freedom the movements that can be performed with the dummy. Hence, an important part of this study consists in simplifying the human movements in order that they can be performedwith the described components and still adequately reproduces theinteraction between the body and the seat.In order to develop and validate this experimental test bench,the movements performed by passengers sitting on or standing upfrom the seat in an actual car have been firstly acquired. Therefore,a four-camera photogrammetry system and a pressure mat havebeen used. This paper also describes the procedures used to captureand reproduce the human body movements and their forces.In this work, an ABB IRB140 industrial robot has been used,as well as a six degree of freedom JR3 industrial force sensor. Forthe development of this test bench, two control architectures havebeen used. The first one is based on a commercial ABB softwareso, it can be used for application development with any ABB industrial robot. The second control architecture proposed is an open architecture allowing access to the robot state variables, much morecomplex motion and/or force controllers can be implemented
