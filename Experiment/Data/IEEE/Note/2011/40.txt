This paper presents several experiments thatverify previously obtained theoretical results. For a large class of taskswhere the robot is to hold a pointing device, such as a painting gun or aheating device, we show through experiments on a real robot, that we canincrease the speed at which the robot tool traverses the surface. In spraypainting it is for example far more important to keep a constant speed thanto hold the paint gun orthogonal to the surface. The method proposed is toimplement a slightly different planning algorithm in turns by allowing asmall orientation error. The trajectory planner will then use the freedomobtained by allowing this orientation error to follow the trajectory witha higher constant velocity. The experiments presented in this paper showthat we are able to reduce the energy needed to paint a surface with about50% or increase the speed at which the paint gun traverses the surfacewith more than 50%.
