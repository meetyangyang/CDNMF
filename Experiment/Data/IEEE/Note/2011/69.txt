Motivated by a node activation policyoptimization problem in a wireless sensor network, the problemof SBO with preference on simple designs is formulated. Simpledesigns have various advantages in practice, e.g., easy to learn,to simulate, and to implement. However, there are few studies inliterature on how to find simple design with good performance.To remove the gap between theoretical study and practical requirement, this paper makes a first attempt. Practitioners usuallyknow which designs are “simpler” and more preferable thanothers. Giving such a complexity hierarchy, an adaptive samplingalgorithm (ASA) is developed, which adaptively allocates thecomputing budget among the designs in order to find the simplestgood design with small probability of making mistake. Since inmany cases simulation is time-consuming, the worst-case instance performance of ASA is quantified. ASA is then compared withblind picking and Levin search in four examples. Note that thetarget value and the tolerance level in the performance are setby the users. The impacts of these values on the computationalcomplexity of ASA are also discussed.
