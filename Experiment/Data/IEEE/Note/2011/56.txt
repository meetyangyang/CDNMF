Micro and mesoscale systems technologyis poised to be an extremely strong economic driver in this century.Market estimations predict large quantities of products involvingthis technology within the next decade and more specifically, mesoand microscale assembly shows enormous potential in a vast rangeof industrial applications. As more microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidic, and optoelectronic devices come onthe market, the complexity and cost of the required manufacturingequipment and/or skill level of humans to assemble such deviceshas also increased. Even though there have recently been substantial advances in the fabrication of microparts, the assembly andpackaging of microsystems and products still account for roughly80% of the cost of commercial products. Manual, labor-intensivemanufacturing will no longer be an option in this next generationof products that will require assembly at the meso, micro, andnanoscales. Thus, the global trend of miniaturizing products hasled to many new assembly challenges that need to be solved inorder for companies to remain competitive. Therefore, driven bythese increasingly competitive requirements for faster throughput,higher yield, and quicker “time to profit” of products, the needfor automated robotic assembly of meso and microsystems is quiteapparent. This paper is on deriving the fundamental conceptsneeded to make these types of systems a reality. System modeling,model fitting, open loop motion plans, robust motion primitives,and quasi-open loop motion plans are synthesized for the canonical peg-in-the-hole assembly task at the mesoscale. Insights onextending the methodology presented to smaller length scales arealso provided.
