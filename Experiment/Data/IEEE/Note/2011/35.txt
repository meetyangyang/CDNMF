Metaheuristics are popular choices tosolve large-scale optimization problems in the real world. However, different algorithms (or an algorithm with different settings)usually have different performance. The solution quality is unknown without running each candidate to the end, which is a wasteof time and resource. Hence, we develop prediction proceduresto predict the future performance of a metaheuristic algorithmbased on the solution sequence obtained at the early stage of therun. The prediction procedures provide statistical information forthe solution value at certain future iteration that is of interest. Theprocedures are easy to implement, and have low computationalcost.
