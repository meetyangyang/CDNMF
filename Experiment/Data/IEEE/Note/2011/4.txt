This paper addresses the schedulingproblem of single-arm cluster tools with reentrant atomic layerdeposition (ALD) processes-a typical wafer revisiting patternin semiconductor fabrication. The revisiting process is 46736terized by two consecutive processing steps that must repeattimes. By analyzing the mechanism of such revisiting process,this paper presents a formal PN-based model and schedulingmethod such that an optimal one-wafer cyclic schedule can befound by comparing only deterministic schedules. Thus, it isreadily applicable to semiconductor manufacturing applicationsthat require reentrant ADL processes.
