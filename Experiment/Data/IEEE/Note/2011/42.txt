People have long realized the importance ofhaving sensor or measurement redundancy in a system as this redundancysafeguards the system against sensor failures or measurement anomalies,so much so that the degree of redundancy is a reflection of the system’s reliability or fault-tolerance capability. Because of dependence relationshipamong the system’s components or subsystems, computing the degree ofredundancy is not a straightforward matter for practical systems whichembed certain structure. There were just a few methods available forcomputing the degree of redundancy, and none of them can handle a widevariety of applications. Our paper presents an easy-to-use new method,which, although does not solve the computational issues entirely, doespresent a faster, competitive alternative for many applications wherein theexisting methods were not able to calculate the degree of redundancy.
