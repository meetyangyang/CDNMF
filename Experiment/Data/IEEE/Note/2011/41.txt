The topological structure of supply networks is considered more and more important in managing a supply network or predicting its development. In this paper;  we introduce a framework to model and analyze the topological structure of supply networks. This work aims to characterize supply networks by statistical methods and can help researchers better understand the material dynamics on supply networks and further conveniently create their own supply networks by summarizing practical supplier-customer connecting rules or analyzing real-world supply network data. The work should be further expanded in other aspects;  such as simulating material dynamics on supply networks;  designing optimal structure by introducing proper supplier-customer connecting rules;  rearranging local connections to enhance the competi tiveness and further ensure the long-term benefit of a target firm;  and so on;  all of which are of much interest for governors;  investors;  and managers and can be studied in the present framework in the future.
