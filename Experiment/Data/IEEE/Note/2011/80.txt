The identification of complex nonlinearengine systems poses challenges on the efficiency, flexibility andgeneralization capability of the identification algorithms. Inspiredby the triumphs of support vector learning methodology in patternrecognition and regression analysis, an innovational nonlinear systems identification algorithm, LP-SVM-ARMA was developedin this paper as a significant stride toward the fusion of modernmachine learning essentials into practical identification strategyfor industrial systems. In particular, the possible generalization ofLP-SVM-ARMA via more complex composite kernel functionsis also discussed to meet the diversity of industrial practice
