Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)are widely used to produce various products with a limitednumber of shared resources in modern factories. Deadlocks area constant threat to the continuous run of an FMS, which oftenleads to catastrophic results in highly automated productionsystems. Based on Petri nets, deadlock prevention is achieved byusing an off-line computational mechanism to control the requestfor resources to ensure that deadlocks never occur. Most of thepresent deadlock prevention methods restrict the system such thata part of permissive behavior is excluded. This often affects theutilization of resources and reduces the productivity of the whole system. In order to handle the problem, this research proposesan efficient deadlock prevention approach that can keep an FMSrunning with maximally permissive behavior. It can almost beapplied to all FMS Petri net models having been proposed inliterature. It is of both theoretical and practical significance andcan interest people in academic and engineering communities.
