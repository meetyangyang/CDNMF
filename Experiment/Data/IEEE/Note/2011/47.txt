The main motivation of this paper is the need of both high performances and high dexterity in micromanipulation and microassembly tasks. In such a case;  not only a sub micrometric accuracy and stability are needed;  but also numerous degrees of freedom. For that;  in the literature;  there exist piezoelectric based structures with two or more DOF. Unfortunately;  the coupling between its axis;  the nonlinearities (hysteresis and creep) and the structure vibration make them very difficult to control and therefore make performances lost. A classical feedback con troller can be employed but when the nonlinearities and vibration become strong;  it is impossible to synthesize a linear controller. In this paper;  we show that the combination of feedforward techniques;  to minimize the nonlinearities and vibration;  and feedback techniques makes possible to reach the high performances required in micromanipulation/microassembly. We notice that the proposed approach can also be applied to other nonlinear;  oscillating and multi-DOF systems;  such as piezotubes.
