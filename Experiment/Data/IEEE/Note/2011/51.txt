In many emerging security applications,there exists a need to guarantee that important information regarding a given system remains secret to outsiders, at least for alimited period of time. The notion of K-step opacity that we introduce and analyze in this paper is appropriate for the security analysis of a system that can be modeled as a partially observed andpossibly nondeterministic finite automaton. The important information that is to be kept secret is captured by a subset of the systemstates. Potential applications include the analysis of security requirements when encrypting using pseudorandom generators, theanalysis of tracking limitations of mobile agents in a certain terrain with a given sensor coverage, and the analysis of anonymityguarantees in protocols for web transactions.
