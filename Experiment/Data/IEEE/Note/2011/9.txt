Time to market and wafer fabricationcycle time are critical for maintaining competitive advantage forsemiconductor manufacturing company. Although a number ofapproaches have been developed for cycle time reduction, little research has been done to exploit the value of the data of various toolsets. Focused on real settings, this study provides a novel method ofmanufacturing intelligence that employed NNs to derive empiricalrules from huge production and tool data that are automaticallycollected in semiconductor manufacturing process for managingWIP levels for corresponding tool sets. This approach was validated in an Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM) focused on aniche market in Taiwan and has been implemented on line.
