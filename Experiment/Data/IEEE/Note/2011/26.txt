The proposed WS-scheme can be easilyimplemented in a VMS that possesses the capability of generatingthe reliance index (RI) of the VM conjecturing value. The RI is defined as the overlapping-area value between the standardized statistical distribution of the NN conjecture value and the MR predictive value. In other words, if a VMS possesses the RI scheme, thisVMS should have both the NN and MR VM results; therefore, theproposed WS-scheme can easily adopt the NN and MR VM resultsas its inputs.
