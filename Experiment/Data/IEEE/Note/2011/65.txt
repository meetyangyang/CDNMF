Abstractâ€”This paper studies a vendor-managed-inventory(VMI) supply chain where a manufacturer, as a vendor, procures atype of nondeteriorating raw material to produce a deterioratingproduct, and distribute it to multiple retailers. The price of theproduct offered by one retailer is also influenced by the prices offered by other retailers because consumers can choose the productfrom any of the retailers. This paper is one of the first papersthat propose an integrated model to study the influence of pricingand deterioration on the profit of such a VMI system. A hybridapproach combining genetic algorithms and an analytical methodis developed for efficiently determining the optimal price of theproduct of each retailer, the inventory policies of the product andthe raw material. Our results of a detailed numerical study showthat parameters related to the market and deterioration havesignificant influences on the profit of the VMI system. However,different from common intuition, we find that an increase in thesubstitution elasticity of the product among different retailers canbring an increase in the retail prices of the product, while theincrease of the market scale can reduce the retail prices.
