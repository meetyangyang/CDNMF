In many flexible manufacturing systems, batch productions are often implemented to reduce cost, shorten changeover time and improve quality. Although flexible manufacturing system has received substantial amount of research attention, the issue of product quality in batch production environment has not been studied. In this paper, we derive analytical formulas to evaluate the quality performance in such systems. In addition, we discover and investigate nonmonotonic properties in quality to provide practical guidance for operation management.
