This article was motivated by the problem of howto automatically produce high quality drive-paths for autonomous transportation vehicles in mines. The vehicles are heavy ( 100 tonnes) but arestill expected to run at speeds up to 20 km/h to be productive. To reachthese speeds without damaging the steering gear and the mechanics of thevehicles, their paths need to be smooth. It turns out that visual inspectionis often insufficient to produce a path with high smoothness. We suggest amethod for computing paths, requiring an a priori knowledge about the environment, that minimizes the amount of steering needed. The computedpaths are safe as they guarantee no collisions between the vehicle and thetunnel wall. We present a study of eight cases based on real-world application data from the Swedish mining company Luossavaara-KiirunavaaraAB (LKAB) showing that, with an average of 32.13%, our paths are fasterto travel along than the paths currently in use.
