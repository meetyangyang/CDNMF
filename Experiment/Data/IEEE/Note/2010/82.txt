This paper was motivated by the needs todevelop systematic methods to assign line-side buffers to a limitednumber of drivers in systems of general assembly line with materialhandling in automotive industry, such that the system throughputis maintained above a desired level. In practice, line-side buffersare typically assigned to drivers by the trial-and-error methodsbased on engineersâ€™ experience. In this paper, the fixed zoning version of the LBAP is mathematically formulated. In order to solvethe problem, two key structural characteristics of the problem are exploited and employed to design an algorithm. Numerical experiments on the real system show that the developed algorithm is effective for solving the LBAP problem. The flexible zoning versionof the LBAP problem would be the future work.
