With increased product diversification,companies must be able to profitably produce in small quantitiesand make frequent product changeovers. This leads to dynamicjob shop operations that require a growing number of setups ina machine shop. Moreover, todayâ€™s customer-driven market andjust-in-time production demand for rapid and adaptive decisionmaking capability to deal with dynamic changes in the job shopenvironment. Within the context, how to come up with effectiveand efficient setup plans where machine availability and capability change over time is crucial for engineers. The adaptive setupplanning approach presented in this paper is expected to largelyenhance the dynamism of fluctuating job shop operations throughadaptive yet rapid decision makings.
