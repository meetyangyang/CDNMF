In the type of production network analyzed in thispaper, each work system autonomously adjusts its production rate with theobjective of maintaining a desired amount of local work waiting to be processed. It is known that production networks can exhibit unfavorable dynamic behavior; for example, oscillation of inventory in supply chains assuppliers respond individually to variations in orders, leading to recommendations that supply chains should be globally rather than locally controlled. However, decentralized planning and control methods are an increasingly important alternative. Dynamic models are used in this paperto demonstrate the need for and benefits of order-flow information sharingbetween the work systems to compensate for variations in the structure ofphysical order flows in such networks. The goals are to avoid slow or oscillatory response to disturbances and to establish and maintain desired network dynamic properties, particularly when the structure of order flows inthe network is omni-directional.
