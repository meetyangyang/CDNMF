This paper shows how one can identifythe bottleneck of a serial line with rework using data on blockages and starvations of the machines. Also, it demonstrates thatthe BN shifts when the quality buy rate is fluctuating. Finally, itshows that downstream machines in production lines with reworkhave a larger effect on the throughput than those upstream (whichis unlike the serial lines with no rework where the effect of a machine is independent of its position in the system).
