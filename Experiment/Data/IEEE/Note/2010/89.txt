Motivated by a practical problem, we study a structural property of optimal policies for opportunistic maintenance of an asset with multiple nonidentical life-limited components. Both economic and structural dependence among the components are considered. During the optimization of joint replacement policies, the action space grows exponentially with respect to the number of components. We identify the GSSRLF rule, which reduces the size of the action space and makes the action selection efficient. We prove that the GSSRLF rule preserves the optimal actions when each component has independent failure with constant rate. The rule has close relationship with several other rules and properties known in literature. Numerical results show that even when the rule is not optimal, it helps to identify good policies. Practitioners can combine the GSSRLF rule with neurodynamic programming to address both large action space and large state space. However, the choice of basis functions is usually problem dependent and experience-based.
