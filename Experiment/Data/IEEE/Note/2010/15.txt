The automated warehouses are the facilitieswhich can be equipped with stationary and mobile robotic sections(e.g. palletization workcells and unmanned forklifts, respectively). Thegoals, such as the maximal production throughput, efficient utilizationof all robotic subsystems and collision avoidance with accommodationto dynamic changes within the manufacturing process itself have beenachieved by designing and implementing a supervisory controller whosemain characteristics are the ability of dynamic routing and schedulingin accordance with the current status of a given shop floor layout. Themaximal throughput is provided by applying a shortest path algorithm,while potential conflicts and deadlocks are resolved by using the time windows insertion and time windows overlapping check algorithms. Becauseof the safety reasons, the proposed supervisory controller is somewhatrestrictive, allowing only one vehicle to reside at one arc at the time. Thedescribed multi-AGV control system was successfully installed and put inoperation at several European factories.
