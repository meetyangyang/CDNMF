Automated robotic microassembly isa promising approach to fabricate the next generation of complex microdevices with relative low cost. The first step in apick-and-place microassembly task is to grasp a micropart witha microgripper. Accurate alignment of the microgripper with themicropart in 3-D space is critical to automated micrograsping. Inthis work, three-stage micrograsping strategy is employed in fullyautomated micrograsping in 3-D space. A vision-based feedbackcontroller for the use in fine alignment is developed based on specially selected patterns, which provides high alignment accuracybetween the micropart and the microgripper. Accurate, efficient,and reliable micrograsping has been achieved. The success of3-D automated micrograsping provides a solid basis for fullyautomated robotic microassembly.
