This paper describes the development of an automated system that consists of hardware and software to monitor the condition of a mechanical door set on board airport ground transportation vehicles. The aim is to use the current and past conditions to estimate (usingneural network predictions) when the door set is in need of scheduled maintenance. This will allow airports to achieve very high availability rates (near100%) for these vehicles, while also achieving cost effective maintenancepolicies. Currently, vehicles tend to be over-maintained because of the availability levels mandated by airport authorities. This system, although in prototype form, shows the viability of an automated condition-based maintenance approach. The drawback proved to be the variability among doorsets from vehicle to vehicle, which means the predictive software of thesystem would need to be customized for each vehicle. Several patents, bothU.S. and foreign, have been granted to this automated system.
