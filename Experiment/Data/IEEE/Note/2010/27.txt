 -splines represent a powerful toolfor the generation of smooth planar paths. Indeed, by means of-splines it is easily possible to obtain complex composite pathswith continuous curvature and curvature derivative. The shapeof -splines can be finely modeled by means of a set of tuningparameters. This positive characteristic poses a practical problemwhen -splines have to be used in a real-time framework: thecomputational burden spent for the parameters tuning must beminimized. The efficient evaluation of such shaping parameterscan convert the -splines from an interesting theoretical toolinto a practical, easy-to-use, path generation primitive. The paperinvestigates this problem and proposes a solution which makes itpossible to easily and efficiently generate paths with low curvaturederivatives. The final example case shows that, owing to thischoice, smooth robot movements, characterized by minimumlateral jerks, can be planned.
