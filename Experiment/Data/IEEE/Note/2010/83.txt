In this work, we are interested in the combination of timed aspects with multitask PLC programming. It canbe used to reduce the reaction time of the control program writtenin Ladder Diagram language to an external signal. To asses safetyproperties, we use a model checking tool, UPPAAL. Basically, themodel-checking technique consists in: i) modeling the program andits environment as a transition system; ii) modeling some propertyas a logical formula; and iii) using an algorithm to test if the modelsatisfies the formula. We propose some techniques and abstractionsto permit the verification of timed properties with the tool UPPAALfor a part of the control of a real system.
