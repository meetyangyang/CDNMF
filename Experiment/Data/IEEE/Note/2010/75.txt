Gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is themost widely used arc welding process. However, its current meltingthe wire is the same as the current heating the base metal. Increasing the melting speed for higher productivity proportionallyincreases the base metal heat input resulting in increased distortion. To resolve this problem, the authors proposed a simple wayto modify the GMAW process such that the base metal current isindependent from the melting current. The melting speed can thusbe increased, while the base metal heat input and resultant distortion are still controlled at given desirable levels. This modifiedprocess, referred to as the double-electrode GMAW or DE-GMAW,has been proved to be capable of doubling the travel speed for automobile welding. However, it is more complex than GMAW andrequires appropriate controls to achieve its claimed advantages.This paper is devoted to the modeling and control of this innovativeprocess.
