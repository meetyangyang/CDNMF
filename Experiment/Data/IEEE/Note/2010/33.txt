This paper was motivated by the needto enhance homeland security in U.S. ports and waterways.The events of 9/11 dramatically increased awareness of securityneeds and resource limitations require the design of cost-effective surveillance systems. Various types of sensors (e.g., radar;electro-optical; infrared camera; seismic; electromagnetic; laser;sonar; and heat, motion, and radioactivity detectors) can beincorporated in a surveillance system. Some types require anunobstructed line of sight; each has unique capabilities that maydepend on the time of day (e.g., lighting during morning, day,or night), weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, snow, bright sun),and distance to a surveillance point. We use the Houston ShipChannel as a test bed, demonstrating that our solution approachcan deal with a problem of realistic size and scope. The HoustonShip Channel is important because it exemplifies ports and waterways in general and because, as the sixth largest port in theworld, it handles the largest foreign tonnage among all U.S. ports.Further, its shoreline is home to a huge petrochemical complexthat includes some of the worldâ€™s largest plants, highlighting theneed for security. The paper presents a new solution approach,branch-and-price decomposition, which should find wide application to actual problems of different types. It applies this approachto design a sensor surveillance system for port and waterwaysecurity, addressing a number of practical considerations thathave not been considered previously in sensor location models:the irregular shapes of ports and waterways (e.g., long, narrowand meandering paths); the line-of-sight requirement between asensor location and a surveillance point; and the capabilities ofeach sensor type, which depend upon the time of day, weatherconditions, and distance to a surveillance point. Future researchcould adapt the proposed approach to address applications suchas border patrol and underwater surveillance.
