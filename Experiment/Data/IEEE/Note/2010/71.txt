To improve product quality and reducecost, batch production is often implemented in many flexible manufacturing systems. However, the current literature does not provide any method to analyze the quality performance in a flexiblemanufacturing system with batch production. Moreover, in suchsystems, different product sequencing and batch policies may result in different quality. Then, how to determine an appropriatesequence or batch policy? How to select the optimal sequence withrespect to quality? Will the quality characteristics change underdifferent policies? Answers to these questions can provide guidance for system design and operation to achieve better quality. Thispaper develops an analytical method to evaluate product quality inflexible manufacturing systems with batch operations and investigate the impact of sequencing and batch policies on quality. Suchmethod could provide engineers and managers a quantitative toolfor quality improvement in flexible manufacturing environment.
