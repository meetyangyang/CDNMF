This paper concerns about the supervisordesign with the involvement of global time information, which ismotivated by industrial applications where time dimension is crucial for their elaborate characterization. These applications, particularly arising in AMS, show that supervisory control specifications may be strongly related to time and would be quite impractical without taking into account indices such as global time.Previously, such a problem is proposed to be dealt with througha methodology based on the Ramadgeâ€“Wonham approach and thetheory of regions, which is ineffective owing to the excessive computational time. The goal of this paper is to propose an algebraic synthesis method that can tackle this problem effectively yet remaintractable. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that effective supervisors can be obtained in a computationally efficient way. Practitioners can easily implement these supervisors.
