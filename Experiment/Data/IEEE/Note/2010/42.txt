Geoscientific workflows are used in several disciplines including for example geology, geophysics hydrology, and petroleumscience. Some of the analysis carried out by geoscientists can now be offered on the World Wide Web using standardized web services. Our studyexamines the potential of workflow enactors to support the creation of geoscientific workflows involving web services based on standards of the OpenGeospatial Consortium. An implementation of a prototype is presented andapplied to the analysis of groundwater vulnerability using borehole data. Asample workflow is implemented using two different workflow enactors andtheir distinct languages to demonstrate that the proposed approach is independent of the workflow enactor adopted. The proposed approach couldbe used to support collaborative workflows that involve analytical servicesprovided by multiple organizations
