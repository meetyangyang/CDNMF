Flow line models can be used to modelassembly lines, tandem manufacturing systems, and robotic workcells such as cluster tools. In semiconductor wafer fabrication,generic cluster tools have become increasingly important andthe class of clustered photolithography tools are essential toproduction. We develop deterministic flow line models allowingfor setups that depend on the location of wafers within a tool.A reduction in computational complexity is achieved by notingthat wafers are often grouped into wafer lots. Tests of the modelsagainst actual production data for clustered photolithographytools have shown that the reduction in computation required tosimulate production with setups is on the order of 50 times, whilestill achieving a throughput and cycle time accuracy of 0.5% and3%, respectively. Thus, for important classes of tools, the modelsare good candidates for use in simulation and to determine a toolâ€™sintrinsic equipment loss (that is, the throughput loss caused bysetups, tool structure, and tool failures).
