An advanced control methodology is formulated for achieving high-precision motion tracking in the field of micro/nano manipulation. In particular, the established control methodology is useful for accomplishing difficult tasks that require the tracking of specified motion trajectories in a constrained environment having a certain degree of unknown stiffness. This control methodology will greatly benefit many advanced areas, which include micro-manufacturing, microassembly, microsurgery, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. One of such applications is the small-scale manipulation of flexure-based grippers. A distinct advantage is offered by this control methodology in the physical realization of the control law. The physical implementation is appropriate, and only the estimates of the system parameters and the force conversion function are required. This proposed control methodology is expected to play a significant role in providing an enabling technology for the control of advanced micro/nano manipulation systems.
