This paper is motivated by the observation that uniform paint coating cannot be achieved in steep turns.Even if the manipulator possesses the necessary actuator torques tomaintain constant speed for a straight line trajectory the torquesneeded to maintain constant velocity during turn are far higher.Thus, the operator has to lower the trajectory speed, also in thestraight line segments where this would normally not be necessary,or accept a thicker layer of paint in the turns. The method proposedin this paper is to implement a slightly different planning algorithm in turns allowing the paint gun to follow the trajectory with ahigher constant velocity. This will allow the paint gun to follow thetrajectory, including both straight line segments and turns, withconstant velocity and thus achieve uniform paint coating. We showhow to choose the desired orientation of the paint gun at everytime step and present the explicit expressions for solving and implementing the algorithms.
