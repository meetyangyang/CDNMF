Handling categorical input variables is moreand more important in solving actual parameter prediction problems.This paper presents a new ANFIS-based parameter prediction methodthat can well handle both numeric and categorical inputs. The proposedmethod extends the structure of the standard ANFIS dealing with numericinputs only. A matrix is proposed to transform categorical inputs intothe corresponding firing strengths of the fuzzy rules in ANFIS accordingto the generation mechanism of firing strengths, while the total firingstrengths are composed of firing strengths associated with both numericinputs and categorical ones. Thus, the difficulty to handle both categoricaland numeric input variables is overcome. To reduce the number of fuzzyrules in the new ANFIS with high-dimensional inputs, this paper presentsa fuzzy c-means method based on a binary tree linear division method forstructure identification of ANFIS. Parameter prediction problems withcategorical inputs can be efficiently solved based on the new ANFIS andits structure identification method. The benefits of the proposed approachinclude better prediction, faster training and easier implementation whenit is compared with the existing ones. It is successfully applied to predicttrim-beam numbers in a practical textile manufacturing schedulingprocess.
