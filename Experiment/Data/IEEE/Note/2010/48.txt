This paper was motivated by a problem inthe management of spare parts under a two-echelon logistics support structure. As demands for spare parts are stochastic, inventory imbalance will occur and tends to grow with time. This imbalance ultimately reaches a situation where some bases hold excess inventories, while others face critical shortage. To correct theimbalance, stocks need to be reallocated periodically. Given an assortment of components located in different units within a two-echelon structure, the goal is to decide when and how much to reallocate these items so as to achieve the optimal system performance.We consider how to perform more than one reallocations within areplenishment cycle, and instead of fixing reallocation instants tocertain time points, we propose how to determine the time pointinstants for reallocation. We then show how our model can be extended to design a cost-optimal periodic resupply policy.
