This paper is motivated by the gap thatscheduling of commonly applied imperfect preventive maintenance(PM) (e.g., adding lubrication, partial replacement, etc.) scarcelyconsiders a systemâ€™s operating condition which is highly correlatedwith machine health and failures. The updated sequential predictive maintenance (USPM) policy developed in this paper outlinesa framework for real-time PM scheduling in a cost-effective way.To implement the proposed method, it is necessary to: 1) monitora performance variable (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.) that wellindicates the system state; 2) estimate the system lifetime distribution; 3) quantify the PM work orders; and 4) measure the maintenance cost. Although the proposed maintenance policy is based onthe objective of minimizing maintenance cost rate (MCR), it can beeasily revised according to other practical optimization objectives,i.e., maximizing system availability.
