Swept volumes are useful for collision detection,ergonomics, mechanical assembly, and many other fields. We successfullytested our method on actual industrial models, including a digital actor.Therefore, no additional work is required in order to put our technique intopractice for polygon soup models. Additionally, the graphics card is onlyused in a way that is easily accessible without special GPU programming.
