Wireless sensor network is an emergingtechnology that finds numerous civilian and military applicationslately. When utilizing the information from a sensor network fordecision making, a statistical estimation procedure is often a necessary intermediate step in order to know about critical system parameters or state variables. For the estimation purpose, the commonly used least-squares estimation (LSE) mechanism is not robust at all against data corruptions or outliers caused by sensorand communication failures. Any single corrupted data point maycause considerable deterioration in an LSE. Applying the robustestimators available from robust statistics research to a wirelesssensor network, however, faces a number of computational challenges. This paper offers several useful algorithms to address these challenges, making the application of a robust estimator easier andmore efficient.
