This paper was motivated by the timelyneed for effective variation reduction in a MAP. In such a process,variations from fixtures, assembly operations, and individualparts may be induced and propagated along assembly stages toaffect product dimensional quality. It is critical and challenging tomodel complex variation propagation for identifying the variationsources and improving product quality. Although commercialproducts offer 3-D variation analysis functionality, there is no explicit model that links product/process design and product quality.Some research has been done to model 3-D variation propagationin multistage machining or assembly processes for 3-2-1 fixturingschemes. However, variations induced by the features on pre-fabricated parts are not explicitly considered. This paper developeda generic modeling approach by using DMV representation.Complex 3-D variation propagation is mathematically modeledby a series of linear transformations of DMVs among four typesof coordinate systems, which are defined as general frameworksfor reference, fixtures, parts, and features on parts. The modelis represented in a state space model format, in which all systemmatrices are explicitly defined through utilizing the availableproduct design and assembly process plan information. Physicalexperiments are presented to validate the model in production.
