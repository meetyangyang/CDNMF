In manufacturing systems with MH (e.g.,GA lines in automotive industry), MH has great impact on systemperformance. It also increases system complexity and in turncauses difficulties and challenges in modeling and simulation. Inthis paper, we focus on developing an efficient simulation approachfor a GA system with MH. An aggregated event-scheduling simulation method with two-level framework (a dividing mechanismwith boundary conditions for top level and a timing focus strategybased on max-plus algebra for bottom level) is introduced toreduce the size of event list. With this new method it is possibleto mimic real production fast and accurately. The experimentalresults suggest that the method provides an efficient way forsimulation modeling and analysis of assembly system with MH.
