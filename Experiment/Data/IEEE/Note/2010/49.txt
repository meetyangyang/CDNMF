The motivation for this work has beenthe difficulties of resuming normal production in a manufacturingsystem after the (often manual) correction of an error. These difficulties are especially pronounced for systems where errors cannotbe foreseen, a common situation, e.g., in the automotive industry.Existing restart methods often assume extensive knowledge of thepossible errors and/or require more computational resources thanare typically available on the shop floor. Therefore, the impact onindustrial practice has to date been limited.We propose a restart method where the above mentioned problems are avoided. The control program is analyzed offline to findthe states from where a restart is possible. If paths to these statesare offline synthesized and stored in the controller, a simple online method executable by any industrial control system can thenrestart the system. This facilitates the work of the maintenance personnel who no longer need to check online the safety of each pathused in the restart.The offline analysis also tells if the system can be restarted by theproposed method from all possible states or if certain situationsrequire special treatment. If all situations cannot be handled byour method, indications of suitable modifications of the system aregiven. In future research, we will address the task of restarting anumber of machines that have simultaneously broken down. Wewill also study how to model the system and structure the work tofacilitate restart.
