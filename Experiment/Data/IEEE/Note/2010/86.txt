Automatic test equipment (ATE) usually hasbuilt-in self-diagnostic programs. The system health can be periodicallyevaluated by running diagnostic routines. This paper proposed a condition-based maintenance approach to predicting the ATE remaining usefullife by analyzing the self-diagnostic data. It can assist manufacturers inachieving lean manufacturing, just-in-time maintenance and zero-downtime production.
