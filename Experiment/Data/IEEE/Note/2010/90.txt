Sensor networks can provide robust and scalable solutions to the localization problem which arises in numerous automation tasks. A common method for localization is triangulation in which measurements from two sensors are combined to obtain the location of a target. In this work, we study the problem of finding the minimum number, and placement of sensors in such a way that the uncertainty in localization is bounded at every point in the workspace when triangulation is used for estimating the location of a target. We present an efficient geometric algorithm for bearing-only localization which can be used for the deployment of camera-networks. We also present a generic framework for arbitrary uncertainty metrics, and demonstrate its utility in an application, where watchtowers are deployed to detect forest fires.
