Multiagent system designers must understand the collective behavior resulting from the interactionsbetween agents in order to build robust systems. For this purpose, there have been efforts to provide appropriate argumentsof stability depending on the nature of system. For example,agent diversity was identified as a key to stabilizing computational ecosystem model and information sharing to supply chainnetworks. This paper drives an argument of stability for the multiagent systems characterized by resource sharing and algorithmsselection. Individual systems are increasingly sharing resourcesand software systems are becoming capable of adapting to environmental changes through alternative algorithms. The argumentis that fairness in such multiagent systems leads to stability andconsequently optimality. However, despite of pursuing fairness,there can be diverse obstacles that give rise to unfairness. Theseobstacles are the limitations of the argument made and, hence, itis needed to extend the argument with respect to these limitationsin future research.
