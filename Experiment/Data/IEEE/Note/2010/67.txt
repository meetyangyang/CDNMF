Conformity of key product characteristics(KPCs) of assemblies to design specifications is critical in product/process design. The capability of achieving the conformity is measured by yield, i.e., the probability of multiple KPCs simultaneously fall in a specification region. This capability is affected bythe uncertainties in design and manufacturing in determining thedimensions, tolerances, and specifications. However, it is difficultto evaluate the impacts of these design factors to the yield becauseof the complex interrelationships among a large number of designfactors, KPCs, and the yield of an assembly system. Three methodsare developed in this paper for yield sensitivity analysis by integrating assembly variation model and yield model to link the design factors to the process capability. The sensitivity with respect tothese design factors indicates the key contributors of quality faults.This can help in optimizing a design by controlling a small set ofthe key factors in design and allocating resources only to the keycontributors for inspection and diagnosis in manufacturing.
