Real-time, high-speed tracking applications are subject to a bandwidth tradeoff between a large field-ofview, a high frame rate and a fine spatial resolution. Because relevant information in tracking problems is often localized in spaceand time, the bandwidth limitation can be partly overcome froma selective transfer and analysis of only those image data that areof momentary relevance for the tracking task at hand. Based onthis approach, we present methods implemented in standard digital hardware that allow a small subset of pixels containing relevantinformation to be selectively exposed, transferred and analyzed inreal time. A prediction model is used to perform this selection and,furthermore, to provide a parametrization of the periodic objectmotion to control external hardware in real time. Beyond the studyof insect flight control, this paper demonstrates a novel approachto track complex and fast moving structures in real-time applications, a challenge often faced in micro and nanotechnologies.
