The primary motivation for this study wasthe pursuit of answers to the problems associated with productionoperations for a pipeless batch plant system in chemical processindustries. These solutions will also apply to other manufacturingsystems for high-mix low-volume production with a number of machines or robots. In many previous studies, scientists addressed theoptimization problem of production scheduling; in this study, however, we focus on a simulation study and aim to develop an applicable integration technology for the coordination of operatingrobots in the interest of the automation of a highly flexible production activity. In practical batch manufacturing systems, as an entire operational strategy, it is necessary to equalize the flow of products, i.e., bottlenecks, throughout the system. Furthermore, once alocalized bottleneck appears, its harmful effect on the system hasto be restrained. Therefore, we suggest efficient operational techniques to tackle these challenging issues. Through various simulation experiments, we show that some good combinatorial techniques enable to improve productivity. The results of this paper arefeasible and sufficient for flexible batch manufacturing systems,but the application is limited to a system in which the safety of production operations and processes is guaranteed. In future research, we will address design problems regarding safety and reliability ina plant system.
