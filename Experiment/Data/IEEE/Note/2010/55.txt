Many complex industrial systems combine subsystems of different dynamical nature. Some of thesystem’s components exhibit continuous behavior (e.g., electricmotors, gears, pistons), while others compel sudden configurationchanges (e.g., clutches, switches, on/off valves). Such systems arereferred to as hybrid dynamical systems (or hybrid systems, forshort). Industrial system’s failures may cause to heavy losses anddamages, this can be significantly decreased using online system’shealth monitoring. There are many methods for system’s healthmonitoring and here we focus on the model-based quantitativetechniques. The model describes the system’s healthy conditionand the method measures the distinction between the system andthe model. In this work, we utilize the HBG modeling approach.Using the HBG for system’s health monitoring requires derivationof analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) which described constraint relations between known system’s variables. Fortunately,by the bond graph modeling approach these constraints relationscan be derived algorithmically, however when the system is hybrida separate derivation process was required for every system’s operating mode. To overcome this, we introduced (Low et al., 2008)the DHBG, and explained how to develop a DHBG from a givenHBG. In this work, we explain who to use the DHBG for healthmonitoring of hybrid systems. The method is based on a set ofglobal analytical redundancy relations (GARRs), which describethe system behavior at all of its operating modes. Based on these new tools we propose a complete quantitative health monitoringframework for hybrid systems. In addition, a method to assessoffline the performances of the monitoring system is proposedbased on new monitoring ability definitions for hybrid systems.Using these definitions, a designer can find the weaknesses of hisdesign and modify the monitoring system to suit his needs.
