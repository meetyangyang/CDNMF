Abstractâ€”In this paper, we describe a model-based behavioranalysis system for assisted living. The goal is monitoring thewell-being of a single occupant in a home. Behavior is defined asany pattern in a sequence of observations. In analyzing behaviorin a smart home, we aim to detect gradual changes in behavior,and atypical (anomalous) behavior. The anomalous behaviormay be the result of equipment failure or the result of significantvariations in the behavior of the occupant. In the context of asmart home, both situations require human intervention althoughthe response will differ. For the purpose of observing behavior, thesmart home is equipped with embedded sensors that unobtrusivelyrecord various environmental parameters. Models of behavior aregenerated from the sensor data. These models are employed todetect trends and infer atypical behavior.
