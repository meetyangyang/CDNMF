Manufacturing processes usually involvecomplicated interactions among process variables, and traditionalrobust design explores these interactions to eliminate the impact ofnoise as much as possible. Nowadays the in-process sensing technology provides real-time estimations of the process variables, andusing this additional information, automatic process control shouldbe able to further improve the quality of process. However, overtrusting these observations in reality will be reacting to noise, andmay lead to an even worse control performance. This paper develops a new automatic process control strategy that will setup andadjust the controllable variables according to the online observations. It also considers the uncertainties during observation andestimation, which further improves the control performance androbustness to sensor noises.
