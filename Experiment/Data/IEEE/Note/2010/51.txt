For physically distributed systems, only acertain local set of events is available for control and observationto a controller located at that site. This paper studies the designof a group of local controllers, one for each local site, so the behavior at each site is as desired. Existence conditions for a monolithic plant as well as for a plant composed of multiple subplantsare obtained. The results can be used to enforce multiple local specifications using the decentralized control strategy presented in thispaper.
