Modern production networks becomelarge due to new communication technologies and globalizationprocesses. These networks are subject to many disturbances suchas changes on market, transport congestions, communicationsdelays, machine failures etc. Their complexity makes it difficultto control them in a centralized way. One possible solution is tointroduce autonomous control, i.e., to allow some parts of a largenetwork to make their own decisions based on local situationand available information. However, stability of the network androbustness with respect to external and internal disturbances andtime delays in signals must be assured to guarantee a reasonableperformance and vitality of the whole system. For this purpose,this paper proposes an approach for controller design for largescale autonomous work systems capable to cope with time delaysand explains its implementation and advantages on a concreteexample.
