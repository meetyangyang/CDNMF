The inspection of containers at a port-of-entry isbecoming a challenging problem as the number of containers increases anda variety of new sensor technologies become available. The sequence ofinspections and the level of inspection have a major impact on the totalcost of inspection and delay of containers at a port. This paper presentsmethods that search for the optimum threshold levels at inspection stations,as well as the optimum inspection sequence to minimize the total cost anddelays. These methods provide the border protection and customs agencieswith approaches based on theoretical foundations yet the results are readilyapplicable.
