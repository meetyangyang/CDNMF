The idea of this study originated from a generalized alignment algorithm irrespective of kinematics and detectors. Waferalignment systems are usually composed of mechanical parts and machinevision. Alignment algorithms can be derived from geometric analysis ofmechanism and misalignment in common. However, an alignment algorithm should be redesigned whenever there are any structural changes ina machine and their performance must be verified by a lot of tests. So,we thought that designing of the algorithm will be unnecessary if we cantrain the relation between misalignment and kinematical movement usinga FNN. This study suggested to obtain 15 training sets for xy alignment,but the positional deviation is less than 5%~10% of the full range in animage. The training sets are applied to a simple FNN which has 4 inputs,3 outputs, two hidden layers and 5 units in each layer. The numbers of thehidden layers and the units in this study is the least value found by experiments. The proposed method showed the better performance than those ofother methods, but is applicable to mass production because of setup timeand manpower for gathering the training sets. We will present an intelligent alignment algorithm to reduce this setup cost in future research.
