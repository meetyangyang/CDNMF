It is well recognized that flexibility andreconfigurability of manufacturing systems pose a major challenge to their automation. There is also a belief among automationresearchers that decentralized intelligent control will contributesignificantly to the flexibility of manufacturing systems. Achievements in practical applications using decentralized control havebeen limited by the standing tradition of automation design withcentralized logic executed on programmable logic controllers(PLCs). The new programming architecture defined by IEC 61499is specifically designed for distributed applications and invalidatesmany existing assumptions about the difficulty of implementingthese systems using partially or fully decentralized execution.In this paper, we present results of developing a distributedautomation architecture based on IEC 61499 for airport baggagehandling systems. Such systems are constantly undergoing reconfiguration, repair and expansion so flexibility is a vital designmetric. We demonstrate several sides of “flexibility” enabled by IEC 61499, including component reuse, maintenance and humaninteraction, and reconfiguration.
