Throughput losses in production systemsmay occur due to two reasons: low product quality and mutual interference of the operations due to blockages and starvations. Typically, these two reasons are considered separately. Recently, animprovement methodology has been developed that offers an integrated approach. The current paper presents a case study utilizingthis approach. Specifically, an automotive paint shop is considered,throughput and quality bottlenecks are identified, and improvement measures are suggested. Some of these suggestions have beenput in place on the factory floor, and the results obtained are reported.
