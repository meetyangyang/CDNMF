The need to apply advanced automationmethods to sample preparation and analysis in the life scienceshas increased at a steady pace. One field of research requiringextreme fidelity for sample preparation is the analysis of cellphysiology with resolution down to the single cell. Key featuresof such systems are the ability to identify cells of interest, selectthem, and place them at predetermined points in space and timefor analysis in configurations where cells are observed while theyrespond to some external stimulus. We present an automatedcell manipulation system using capillary micropipettes and vision-guided robotics. This system implements automation of cellselection, micropipette positioning, cell placement, and release.The system has the ability to transfer living, individual cellsfrom a culture dish to target locations with a 100% success rate.Our incorporation of a fluidic manipulator for aspirating anddispensing picoliter-volumes of fluid with precise flow rate controlwill enable knowledge of the exact location of an aspirated cellwithin the micropipette, reducing cell loss and increasing celltransfer yields and rates. The proposed robotic system providesessential functionality with single-cell resolution and is therefore the appropriate technology for practitioners with this functionalneed.
