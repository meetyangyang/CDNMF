This paper was motivated by the development of the programmable toolings (PTs), which are increasinglyused in multistage manufacturing processes. The PTs serve astooling locators in a certain operation stage and can be programmed to adjust the parts and/or subassemblies positions tocompensate the errors that have been introduced in the precedingstages. Therefore, the control of the PTs to make optimal adjustments is a challenging issue for the variation reduction purpose.The application of feed-forward control strategies based on variation propagation model can implement automatic adjustmentson a part-by-part basis. However, due to the unavoidable randomerrors, the actual variation propagation model may randomlydeviate from the nominal model derived according to the nominalproduct/process design parameters. The random errors maybe introduced by the part fabrication process or by precedingassembly process. They may change the actual values of themodel coefficients and cause the model uncertainty in practice.This type of model uncertainty may significantly deteriorate the performance of PTs when the magnitude of variation is large. Thispaper proposed an innovative control strategy taking into accountthe uncertainty of the variation propagation model. When themagnitude of process variation is large, the control action derivedbased on the proposed strategy will outperform that derivedwithout considering model uncertainty. A case study is conductedto demonstrate its effectiveness.
