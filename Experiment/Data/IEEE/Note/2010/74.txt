IADs are force-control based roboticdevices that enable a human operator to handle heavy modules,and they play a valuable role in automobile production lines. IADscan function in both a force control mode, defined as a hands-oncontrol mode, and in an automatic traveling mode, defined asthe hands-off control mode. How the unit switches between thehands-off and hands-on control modes has a considerable impacton productivity of automotive manufacturing. Smooth controlmode switching, i.e., control mode switching without abrupt deceleration, could be achieved in our previous study. However, safetymeasures for dealing with the hazardous behaviors, i.e., carelessbehaviors that disregard an approaching IAD in hands-off controlmode, which might cause serious injuries to the operator, werenot considered. The objective of our study is to develop a safetymeasure ensuring smooth control mode switching of an IAD basedon the method in our previous study, the use of laser range sensors(LRSs), and a pattern recognition algorithm. The proposed safetymeasure is expected to allow smooth control mode switchingof IADs in practical automobile manufacturing; it can ensuresafety monitoring that continuously operates an IAD without the production cycle delay by the frequent abrupt deceleration.This is important for efficient and safe operations of IADs withhands-off and hands-on control modes and will contribute towardeffective automobile manufacturing. However, the proposed safetymeasure adopted the general purpose type LRSs and depended onthe relatively large-scaled software for safety purpose. Therefore,LRS with certification by safety standards, and techniques andverification processes for safe software are essentially required forpractical application. Moreover, the proposed safety measure wasverified by certain foreseeable hazardous behaviors; for furtherimprovement and practical application, it should be verified forother possible behaviors in fields where IADs are used.
