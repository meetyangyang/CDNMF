The Prognostics-Based Ranking Algorithm is well suited for maintenance planning and scheduling inlarge scale fleet management applications. The PBR algorithmuses sensor signals from identical components on different unitsin a fleet, and proceeds to rank these units based on the residuallives of these components. The amplitude of the signal and thecorresponding operational time are used to make inferences ofthe statistical distribution of the residual life of the componentthat is being monitored. The degradation modeling frameworkpresented herein can be used to model various types of degradation signals that can be characterized using parametric functionalforms. In this paper, we present a base case model that is suitablefor engineering applications where the sensor signals follow anexponential path.
