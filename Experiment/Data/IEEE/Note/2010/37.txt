The objective of application schedulingin heterogeneous environments such as computational Grids typically targets the minimization of execution time. This single criterion optimization can have serious limitations leading to inefficient resource utilization, use of unreliable resources, or high economic cost. In practice, a tradeoff between multiple contradictingrequirements is usually required, which is often for the scientistshard and non-intuitive to specify in a single objective function. Wepropose in this paper a new and more user-friendly method forthe specification of the bi-criteria scheduling problem that targetsthe optimization of two contradicting criteria: a primary criterionand a secondary criterion specified as a sliding constraint functionof the primary criterion. We design an new bi-criteria schedulingalgorithm based dynamic programming as on extension of the multiple-choice knapsack problem. Simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms tworelated methods designed for the same problem, the tradeoff beinga higher execution time complexity.
