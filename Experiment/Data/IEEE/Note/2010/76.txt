The contribution of this study is topropose solutions to the estimation and arbitration problem onthe RFID MAC layer protocol for the frame-slotted ALOHA.We present efficient estimation and anticollision algorithms toestimating and arbitrating an unknown quantity of tags. The fullcollision phenomenon and the impact to the estimation accuracyare studied. When full collision occurs, our proposed anticollisionalgorithm can be effectively solved and use less time slots to readall tags and it has the maximum throughput close to the theoretical value. The proposed algorithms are useful for engineers toimplement the RFID systems by setting proper frame length toenhance the current RFID standards such as ISO 18000-6 or EPCclass 1 generation 2.
