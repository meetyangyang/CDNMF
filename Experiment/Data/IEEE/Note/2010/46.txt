When levitation systems are used fortransporting objects without contact, there is a practical problemthat objects may be lost (dropped) if planar accelerations are toohigh, because the lateral holding force in these systems is veryweak. This paper proposes a solution in which the object and itslevitator are tilted so that a part of the stronger levitation forceis also used to compensate for these planar accelerations. Tiltingangles are realized directly based on the acceleration of the movingactuator, so that measurement of the relative lateral position witha feedback tilt control is not necessary. While it increases thecomplexity of the levitator since a tilting mechanism is needed,fast noncontact manipulation can be realized.
