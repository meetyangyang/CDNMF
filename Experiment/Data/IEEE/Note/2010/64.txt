In this paper, an important problem in manufacturing industry is addressed: how semantic features can be used acrossdifferent domains in CE. The proposed hierarchical feature model in thispaper offers a solution to two aspects in this problem: (a) how to capture thespecific knowledge consistently in different domains and (b) how to reusethe existing data. The presented modeling approach is an attempt that usesa semantic feature language representation in CE and sheds some light ona practical solution to this difficult problem in industry.
