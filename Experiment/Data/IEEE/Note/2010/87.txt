Tag estimates proposed in this paper are capable ofprecisely estimating tag quantity in a dynamic framed aloha RFID system.The main advantage of the proposed estimates is to present a method to reduce computational complexity of estimating tag quantity. Since estimatingtag quantityis generally processed at a reader, the presentedmethod can helpengineers to improve the reader’s running speed and reduce the reader’smemory usage. In current RFID standards such as ISO-18000-6 and EPCC1 Gen2, the durations of an idle, a collision and a successful slot are set tobeing different to improve identification efficiency. Under such conditionof the slot duration, the published frame length schemes would not guarantee maximum channel usage efficiency. Since setting frame length is notspecified in these standards, engineers can reduce the time of identifyingtags by applying an optimal frame length derived in this paper to thesestandards. The maximum channel usage efficiency of the derived framelength surpasses that of the published schemes.
