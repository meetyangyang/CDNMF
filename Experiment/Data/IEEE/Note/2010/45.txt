The works presented in this paperare motivated by the high performances required in micromanipulation and microassembly tasks. Such a domain requireshigh accuracy, sometimes submicrometric, and stability of themicromanipulators. While piezoelectric cantilever structuresare very widespread in this domain, their nonlinearities andvibrations undeniably limit their performances such as accuracyand overshoots. This may be detrimental for the micromanipulation/microassembly tasks. Feedback control techniques couldeasily improve their performances but the sizes of accurate andlarge bandwidth sensors do not make them easily embarkablefor micromanipulation/microassembly systems. Thus, controllerswithout sensors are of great interest. In this paper, we show thatopen loop control techniques (also called feedforward techniques)can improve the general performance of piezocantilevers dedicated to micromanipulation/microassembly tasks. We noticethat the techniques can also be applied to other nonlinear andoscillating systems.
