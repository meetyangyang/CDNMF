Fault monitoring and diagnosis of a complex hybrid system are challenging tasks and of great potentials.A complex hybrid system consists of both continuous and discretesubsystems and its health hinges on the capability for FDI. Thecomplexity of hybrid systems demands a suitable analytical modeland associated properties to effectively detect a fault and isolate afaulty component. HBG provides a systematic modeling paradigmthat allows users to model complex hybrid systems. The causalityof this hybrid bond graph enables the derivation of quantitativeequations that are critical for fault detection and isolation. In thispaper, we study the causality of the hybrid bond graph and presentseveral useful properties. These properties lead to the concept of diagnostic hybrid bond graph (DHBG) which allows users to deriveunified quantitative equations for fault detection and isolation inhybrid complex systems. By this unified quantitative description ofthe hybrid system, a separate analysis of each individual mode, forFDI, is not required as in other methods. The unified descriptioncan significantly reduce the computational effort, which is requiredfor real-time implementation of health monitoring of complex hybrid systems. To develop a DHBG from a given HBG, a systematicprocedure that can be implemented on a computer, is proposed inthis paper.
