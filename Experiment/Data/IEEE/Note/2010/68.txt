This work was motivated by the desire toavoid premature failures in spline couplings due to unanticipatedheavy loadings. Designers of spline couplings typically use rules ofthumb to choose spline parameters given desired spline loading.By applying a statistical model of the tooth clearance variation toa structural deflection analysis of a spline coupling, new insightshave been gained. This new engineering model explains why toothloading is nonuniform, and permits a more accurate prediction ofthe number of teeth engaged and the load distribution. The effectof the each of the parameters that define spline geometry can bethoroughly investigated. Designers can use this new analytical toolto improve performance, reduce cost, and extend the use of splinesto more challenging applications. The resulting spreadsheet allowsa designer to easily calculate the expected performance of a coupling, and avoid premature failure due to underdesign and excessmass and cost due to overdesign.
