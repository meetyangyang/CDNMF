This paper is motivated by a practical banking facility location problem. The problem is how to choose the facilities (bankbranches) location in order to maximize the facility networkâ€™s profits. Itis a large-scale optimization problem in the real world. We formulate thisproblem with an extended MCLP model and apply a hybrid nested partitions algorithm. Our approach is efficient since it combines the mathematical programming and problem specific heuristic information. Practitioners who want to use this approach should pay attention to the utility ofproblem structure and model formulation. This approach is also applicableto other location problems, such as the retail chain stores, gas stations, citypublic facilities, and so on.
