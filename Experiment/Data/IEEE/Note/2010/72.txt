When designing an automation system,an important challenge is to specify in what sequence the differenttasks, or operations, should be executed. This has become aproblematic bottleneck in the automotive industry, especially forbody-in-white manufacturing. The rising needs on manufacturingflexibility increases the complexity of the entire manufacturingsystem, as well as its control function, the sequence of operations.This paper proposes a new sequence planning approach, wheresequences are viewed based on the relations among operationsinstead of manually constructing the sequence. By the use ofdifferent views the sequence of operations related to, e.g., thepart flow, robot operations or operator tasks can be visualized.Different views help the user to easier understand the relationbetween different parts and components, as well as the totalsystem behavior.
