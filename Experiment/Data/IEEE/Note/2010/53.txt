Today robots and machines in automatedproduction are usually controlled by a special industrial computercalled Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Although PLCprograms are widely used in manufacturing industry, currentprograms tend to be difficult and time-consuming to modifywhen needed. They are also often tested to work first on the realequipment, which may be expensive since the regular productionis stopped for code testing and error resolving. In this work, weintroduce Reusable Automation Components (RACs), to facilitatePLC program development. Reusing components may speed upthe development and also reduce the number of errors, if the components are already verified to work properly before the reuse. Toachieve this, the RACs can be richly specified, defining the correctuse and behaviour of the components. The specification can thenbe used to verify, formally, whether the RAC works correctlyor not, according to the specification. Formal verification usesmath-based models and algorithms to automatically explore allpossible behaviours of the component. The RAC can be automatically translated to a tool that performs the formal verificationand shows counterexamples if the specification is not fulfilled. Thespecification and verification of RACs are intended to be usefulfor control logic engineers. Hence, the specification of the RAC is based on the structure and languages of conventional PLCprograms. This paper discusses a number of industrial exampleswhich show the applicability of the RACs. The RAC frameworkcan be further improved, especially by developing guidelines andaid for writing the specifications.
