Reentrant lines are encountered in semiconductor, electronics, automotive, and many other manufacturing industries. The performance analysis of reentrant lines is important for design, operation, and continuous improvement. Thus, developing a tool for performance analysis of reentrant lines is necessary and important. In this paper, an iterative method is developed to approximate the production rates of reentrant lines with Bernoulli machine reliability model under LBFS scheduling policy. The numerical results and case study suggest that this method can provide an acceptable precision for production rate estimation. Extending the method to different scheduling policies, other machine reliability models and more complex systems is desirable and a topic of future work.
