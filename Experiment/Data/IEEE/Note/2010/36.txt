This paper is motivated by the needs todevelop new elevator scheduling methods that can make effectiveuse of advance traffic information. A novel two-level formulationis developed, with detailed car dynamics embedded in simulationmodels for performance evaluation. Taking advantage of advanceinformation, a new door action control method is suggested for cardynamics to increase the flexibility of elevators. Key problem characteristics are exploited to develop an effective two-level optimization framework, where the high-level solution method can be extended to solve a generic class of sequential decision problems. Numerical results demonstrate values of advance information and thenew door action control method, and effectiveness of our solutionmethod. Further improvement is needed to reduce CPU time foronline implementation.
