In practical industrial process, there aremany important parameters that cannot be calculated accurately.Many intelligent methods have been used to estimate these parameters based on production data in the past decades. However, sometimes, the accuracy of estimation is not satisfied for industrial production. In this study, a new ensemble ELM is proposed using modified AdaBoost.RT as a efficiently intelligent method. It is also usedto establish an intelligent model for predicting the temperature ofmolten steel in LF as an example, and the good performance ofthe new ensemble is demonstrated. The new proposed method canboost the accuracy of the method that using single intelligent algorithm. Therefore, it can be widely used in intelligent prediction orestimation especially for the important industrial parameters.
