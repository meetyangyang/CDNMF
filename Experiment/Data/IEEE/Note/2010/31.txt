This paper was motivated by the problemof modeling and evaluating the reliability of coordinate sensor systems used for manufacturing process fault diagnosis, which has notbeen investigated in the literature. Dimensional integrity is a majorquality concern in many discrete-part manufacture processes, suchas assembly processes and machining processes. In order to reachhigh product quality, coordinate sensor systems are deployed todetect the root cause of the dimensional deviations. However, if thesensors fail to work properly within the manufacturing environment, the measurement will offer inaccurate information. It will,in turn, cause high risk of false alarms, misdetection of processfaults, and will eventually cost the userâ€™s confidence on the sensorsystem. Thus, it is important to evaluate the reliability of a coordinate sensor system in the design phase. In this paper, we developthe reliability model of the coordinate sensor system when considering the sensor failure mode of sensor precision degradation. Itturns out that the computational time to evaluate the sensor systemreliability is essentially exponential. In order to overcome this difficulty, we then develop a method to evaluate the upper bound andlower bound of the system reliability, which can approximate thesystem reliability well, while reducing the computational time significantly. Finally, we provide a case study for an automotive bodyassembly process to show that different choices of sensor positionsmay result in very different sensor system reliabilities, and the design with higher reliability is much preferred. In this paper, we onlyfocus on the sensor failure mode of sensor precision degradation.In our future research, we will combine other sensor failure modes,such as catastrophic sensor failure and mean shif
