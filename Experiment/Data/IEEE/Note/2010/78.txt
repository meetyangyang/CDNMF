In this work, we present an overallstudy of networked automation systems working according toclient/server paradigm. Unlike systems where a global schedulingof the shared resources is available and the delays well handled,in such systems it is not the case and the investigations to evaluatetheir real-time performances are required. Actually, these systemsare very present in industry but the efforts to deal with this issueare rare and often informal, based on simulation of particularcases. In our work, we assess a major criterion of their time performances, the response time. We give a formal evaluation of thisfeature through an analytic approach. The results we present aregeneric and fit the experimental observations in different cases.
