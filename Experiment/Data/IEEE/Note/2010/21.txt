The Internet and associated computing capabilities have made it possible for scientists to derive novel datasets throughcomplex processing of existing datasets that may be collected from manylocations. But scientists rarely document dataset provenance - the set ofprocesses and a description of how those processes were used - to allowderived datasets to be recreated. Enabling such recreation is an essentialpart of repeatable science, and thus it is imperative that any datasetgenerated by scientific computation include provenance metadata, documentation of the precise way in which that dataset was produced.Provenance metadata can help assure that scientists and others understand the value and limitations associated with using that data, butcreating provenance metadata is a difficult and time-consuming problem.This paper describes an approach for helping scientists deal with theproduction and management of their datasets, including the automatedgeneration of provenance metadata. The approach is based on the use ofa precisely defined process definition language. The language is relativelyclear and easy for scientists to understand, yet it is precise enough tosupport their control of the application of computing capabilities to thegeneration of datasets, and is also an aid to the management and understanding of these datasets. This paper illustrates these ideas by providinga case study of a specific problem in ecological dataset production andmetadata provenance generation.
