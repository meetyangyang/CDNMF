For rapid growth of transportation systems for semiconductor fabrication bay, it is required to generate acollision-free route planning for multiple AGVs efficiently to minimize the total traveling time. Conventional decomposition techniques for mathematical programming need reformulation of theoriginal problem when new constraints are added, that makes itextremely difficult to modify the optimization model. PNs can beused as a tool to integrate modeling, simulation, and optimizationfor designing transportation systems. This paper presents a modeling and optimization of route planning for multiple AGVs by PN.The main difficulty for optimization is the state explosion for PN.To reduce computational complexity, we propose a PN decomposition approach for solving large-scale optimization problems efficiently. The PN model is partitioned into several decomposed subnets. The local solutions of the subnets are integrated by the noveloptimization algorithm. The shorter computation time by the proposed method enables us to use the proposed methodology for therapid design and dynamic optimization for AGVs transportationsystems in semiconductor manufacturing.
