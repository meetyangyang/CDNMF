Micro and nanoscale component-baseddevices are revolutionizing health care, energy, communication,and computing industry. Components need to be assembled together to create useful devices. Such assembly operations remainchallenging in spite of the advancements in imaging, measurement, and fabrication at the small scales. This paper deals withdirected assembly using optical fields that is useful for prototypingnew design concepts, repairing devices, and creating templates forself-assembly.
