This paper was motivated by the problemof automated handling of live chickens on moving conveyors forpoultry meat processing. The method presented here can alsoapply to other object handling applications where the absolutelocation of the randomly shaped moving object is used as atriggering signal for subsequent operation. Existing approachesgenerally rely on the use of the conveyor speed with a beam switch(or a line scan array) and are unable to account for object slippageor voluntary motion. This paper suggests a new approach usinga pair of orthogonal optical line sensors along with the knownconveyor speed to determine the absolute location and lateralprofile of the object on the moving conveyor; both engineeringand natural objects are considered. In this paper, we formulate alocating method that exploits the fast scan rate of photoelectricsensors to detect discrepancies between the position/velocity of theobject and the conveyor. We then illustrate how this informationcan be used to compensate for object slippage due to conveyoracceleration and perform object-based location calibration. Preliminary physical experiments conducted on a small number oflive chickens using (300 mm-long) line sensors (consisting of 128emitter/receiver pairs spaced at 2.5 mm) sampled at a rate of40â€“50 ms suggest that this method has a significant potential inapplications such as active singulation where object injuries dueto unpredictable voluntary motion must be minimized.
