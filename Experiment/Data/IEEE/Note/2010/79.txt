Diagnosis is needed to detect the occurrence of a fault so as to enable any corrective actions. Forevent-driven systems with timing-requirements, diagnosis involvesdetecting the timing-faults, besides the sequence-faults. Thisrequires monitoring timing and sequence of events, both of whichmay only be partially observed in practice. This paper extendsthe prior work by allowing time to be partially observed (using adigital clock which measures the advancement of time with finiteprecision by the execution of ticks), and provides a conditionunder which faults can be detected within a bounded time delay.It is shown that the diagnosis problem can be transformed to oneof untimed setting, and so the existing techniques from untimedsetting can be applied.
