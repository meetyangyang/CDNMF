This work is motivated by the problemof deadlock prevention in flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs).Petri-net-based deadlock prevention policies are popular. We propose a new concept of Petri nets, KP. Based on it, we develop twoeasy-to-implement deadlock prevention policies for FMS. The ideabehind them is simple, i.e., deadlocks can be prevented by controlling some key resources such as machines and robots. Compared with such policies as iterative control policy and elementary-siphon-based policy, the proposed ones can make the supervisor simpler. They also enjoy higher adaptability to the change ofthe resource quantities. In other words, when some new resourcesare put in service or some resources have to quit, the correspondingsupervisor requires trivial adjustment. This is certainly importantin achieving the goal of agile manufacturing and automation. However, the computational complexity of the proposed policies is stillhigh despite their low control implementation cost since all strictminimal siphons have to be computed in order to generate theKP-based supervisors.
