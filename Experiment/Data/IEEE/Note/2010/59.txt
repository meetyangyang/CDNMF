With the liberalization of the taxi industry in Singapore and elsewhere, keener competition amongtaxi operators has emerged. We believe the taxi operator thatleads the competition will be the one with the best automatedtaxi dispatch system, offering the highest cost productivity andcustomer satisfaction. Our research is motivated by the increasingneed for better automated approaches to match customer servicerequests and taxis, whose arrival and availability, respectively,might be sporadic or not known a priori. In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent system, called TuCab dispatch, toautomate taxi dispatch in a distributed fashion. Our experimentsfor a 1000-strong taxi fleet show that TuCab dispatch canoutperform existing centralized dispatch in terms of reductionin customer waiting and empty taxi cruising times, when bothleverage on real-time traffic information for shortest-time pathcomputation over a road network as proposed (Lee et al., 2004).Additionally, TuCab dispatch can be implemented on an existing technological infrastructure, providing the opportunities toharness the existing power of multiple intelligent transportationsystems technologies. A more efficient dispatch system can helpmaintain a higher standard of customer service vis-Ã -vis human driver satisfaction, especially when the demand for taxi serviceis manageable for the fleet size. In future research, we will needto add more features and investigate their effectiveness towardsachieving overall efficiency, including techniques to influence andbetter match the physical distributivity between service demandand available taxi supply in real-time.
