This paper was motivated by the fact that the existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, including hardware and software, cannot meet the requirement of real-time response to time-criticaldisasters due to the barriers of UAVs mobile operation capability in remote site and huge time-consuming of data postprocessing and computation. This paper presented an end-to-end, systematic design, and implementation of a small and low-cost UAV system, including hardware andsoftware. The entire UAV system is housed on a mobile vehicle (called fieldcontrol station) for providing command, control and data recording to andfrom the UAV platform, and real-time data processing in order to meet therequirement of fast-response to time-critical disaster. The field control station houses the data stream monitoring and UAV position interface computer, radio downlinks, antenna array and video terminal. All data (GPSdata, UAV position and attitude data, and video data) are transmitted tothe ground receiver station via wireless communication, with real-time dataprocessing in field. The processed geo-referenced video flow, with an accuracy of 1-2 pixels, can be immediately merged with GIS data, so that thereal-time response to disaster can be promptly deployed.
