This paper is motivated by the need todevelop a generalized approach that can detect defects on mostof the 2-D patterned textures defined so far. It proposes a novelmotif-based defect detection method for 16 out of 17 wallpapergroups. A new concept called energy of moving subtraction is defined using norm metric measurement between a collection of circular shift matrices of motif and itself. Together with its variance,an energy-variance space is defined where decision boundaries aredrawn for classifying defective and defect-free motifs. The methodhas been evaluated by two categories of patterned textures. Thefirst category is produced from patterned fabric samples from p2,pmm, p4m, pm, and cm groups. The second category is producedfrom various patterned texture samples from p4, pg, pmg, cmm,p4g, pgg, p31m, p6, p6m, and p3m1 groups. For the former, a totalof 280 defect-free lattices samples are used for deriving the decision boundaries, and further 340 defect-free and 206 defective lattices are used for evaluation. The detection success rate is found tobe 93.92%. For the latter, they are the images from painting, tile,ornament, painted porcelain, vessel, earthenware, mat, tapestry,cloth, and wall tiling. A total of 101 defect-free lattices are acquiredand 27 defective lattices are used for defect detection. The detectionsuccess rate for the second category is 92.59%. An overall detection success rate of 93.86% is achieved for the motif-based method.No other (generalized) approach was able to handle such a largenumber of wallpaper groups of 2-D patterned textures, and hence this result outperforms all other previously published approaches.This result contributes to the quality assurance of production oftextile, wallpaper, ceramics, ornament, and tile.
