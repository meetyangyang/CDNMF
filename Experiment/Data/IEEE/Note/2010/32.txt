Cluster tools are a kind of integrated manufacturing equipment adopted in semiconductor fabrication. Withresidency time constraints and no intermediate buffer, it is difficultto schedule them. This paper presents a unique Petri net formalismto the problem of scheduling dual-arm cluster tools. Based on thismodel, schedulability conditions and algorithms for finding an optimal periodic schedule are presented. With the proposed method,schedulability conditions can be checked and the optimal periodicschedule can be found analytically. Thus, it can be applied to solvepractical application problems.
