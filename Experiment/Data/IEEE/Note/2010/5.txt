This paper was motivated by the problemin design prototyping of micro optics. In general, the design processis time consuming and prototyping of micro optics always requiresa tooling for injection molding or hot embossing. The cost for fabricating the tooling is relatively high compared to direct machining.Unfortunately, component with micro optics is hard to manufacture by direct machining owing to the problems of precision andaccuracy. This paper suggested a new approach in designing andprototyping of the micro optics. With the aid of the computer-aideddesign system, the design process was being expedited. The designer could verify the optical system without any physical model.Once the design was being confirmed, a prototype could be fabricated by using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). From the experimental results, the AFM was proven to be a rapid fabricationmethod with high precision and accuracy, which eliminated mostof the problems confronted by the conventional techniques.
