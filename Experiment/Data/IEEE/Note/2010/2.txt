Motivated by a real project for an AS/RS,we study the constrained shortest path problem. It is a fundamental network optimization problem of great practical interestin transportation planning, telecommunications network routing,logistics management, etc. We present an efficient algorithm forsolving this problem. One novel feature of this algorithm is its “robustness.” Comparing with previous works, its computational performance is much less sensitive to the network size and the valueof . The algorithm has been implemented as a core engine of arouting control system in the AS/RS. Meanwhile, it can serve as abasis for solving more complicated problems such as the multi-criterion constrained shortest path problem.
