This paper was motivated by the problem of developing a physical model capable of finding the directions of force and moments required to open a knotted plastic bag—which forces will contributetoward opening the knot and which forces will lock it further. The analysis was part of the implementation of a reinforcement-learning algorithmfor a fixed-arm robot system called “RoboShake.” The learning task was toobserve the position of a bag contains suspicious items (such as biologicalor chemical items), grasp it, and learn the optimal sequence of motions toshake out its contents in minimum time. An extremely interesting findingwas the fact that the robot’s optimal policy always converged to a one thatwas consistent with Newton’s three laws of motion. The system learned theoptimal policies by interaction with the environment without using theselaws as part of the system design/implementation. From a philosophicalaspect, the experimental robotic platform found solutions that were consistent with Newton’s laws of motion, i.e., the system was capable of explainingNewton’s laws of motion without being “aware” of them, and in a way, andto “discover” the existence of the second and the third laws. Experimentalsystems of this kind, especially if designed with a capability to carry outnew experiments independently, may help to explain, discover, or predictlaws/rules (not necessarily of machines/robots) that are not known to us yet.
