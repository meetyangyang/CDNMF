This paper presents techniques to planthe motions of multiple robots to visit and process a given set ofpoints, subject to geometric constraints on the robot motions. Thispoint set coverage task is motivated by a laser drilling applicationfor electronics manufacturing. The goal is to minimize the timetaken to visit the points by parallelizing the robot operations whileavoiding robot collisions. Similar tasks arise in many applicationsincluding drilling, electronics manufacturing, circuit testing, spotwelding, and sensor network data collection. We model the assignment of points in the plane to robots as a matching problem and thepoint traversal order generation as a Traveling Salesman Problem.We present effective algorithms to plan the motions of the robotsfor large data sets (involving hundreds of thousands of points), anddemonstrate the feasibility of our approach for 2 and 4 robots.
