The multidepot vehicle routing problem is one ofthe common optimization problems in the logistics area. In a real-worldenvironment, drivers choose the shortest route to reach a destination sincethey assume that it should take the shortest time to travel the shortest route.However, if some events such as traffic congestions, accidents happen in theshortest route, the traveling time spent on this route can be greater thanthat on the longer route. Thus, this paper considers not only the cost dueto the total traveling distance, but also the cost due to the total travelingtime, as two objectives. We propose a stochastic search technique calledFLGA to solve the problem. Based on the promising computational resultsobtained in this paper, the proposed model and technique will be effectivefor industries to be applied in solving real-world problems.
