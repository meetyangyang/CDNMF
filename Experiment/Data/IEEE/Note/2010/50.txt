The capacitated multi-item lot sizingproblem with setup times considered in this paper is motivatedby the attempt of effectively planning the production with lowersetup cost and inventory holding cost under the constraints oflimited capacities. An effective production planning on a lot sizingproblem can provide a good guidance on the decision made by aMaterial Requirements Planning (MRP) system, and check for theconflicts with available capacities. Two areas of approaches areimplemented to deal with the problem: the exact approach and theheuristic approach. The main drawback of the exact approach isthe excessive computational time when the problem size becomeslarge. On the other hand, the main drawback of the heuristicapproach is an inefficient objective solution. The goal of thispaper is to propose a heuristic approach which outperforms otherstate-of-the-art approaches found in the literature. Practitionerscan apply the proposed method into the extensions of lot sizingproblems which consider backlogging, overtime, and shortage.
