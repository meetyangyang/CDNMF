For an automated manufacturing systems(AMS), the application of Petri nets facilitates the design of liveness-enforcing supervisors whose ingoing and outgoing transitionsare in practice associated with certain observation and control operations, respectively. Different supervisors lead to different implementation cost and system throughput. By associating both costand duration information to each transition, this paper proposes amethod to evaluate and synthesize a supervisor. This work allowsindustrial engineers to design a supervisory controller that canachieve low implementation cost and high throughput for AMS.
