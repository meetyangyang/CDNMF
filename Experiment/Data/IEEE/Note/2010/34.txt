To survive in the highly competitive business environments of these days, semiconductor manufacturingcompanies, like many others, should operate their facilities at themaximum effectiveness and efficiency, and this requires carefulproduction planning and scheduling, among other approaches.In this paper, we propose a two-level HPP method for a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility (fab) producing multiple producttypes, such as ASIC products and system large-scale integratedcircuits, with different due dates and different process flows. Inthe proposed method, a production plan is generated by solvinga LP model with aggregated information in the higher level, andoperations are scheduled with a priority-rule-based schedulingmethod, and feasibility and goodness of the schedule as well as theproduction plan are checked and evaluated with a discrete-eventsimulation model in the lower level. We adopt an iterative schemeto obtain a good and feasible production plan.Results of computational experiments show that the proposedmethod works better than a method suggested in an earlier research in terms of both the total cost, which is composed of production, inventory and backorder costs, and the total tardiness of theorders. Also, it is found that by employing good scheduling rulesrather than simple and intuitive rules, one can obtain better overallplans for the fab, as well as better schedules for the workstations.The proposed methodology can be practically used in many realfabs, since the approach is rather general and it can be applied tovarious types of fabs provided that there is a simulation model ofthe fab. Moreover, it can deal with planning and scheduling problems of large sizes, i.e., those producing a large number of producttypes with distinct due dates, and it generates good productionplans and schedules without requiring excessively long computation time.
