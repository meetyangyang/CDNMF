Web services composition is an emerging area for business process automation. This work presents a novel framework to compose web services from the perspective of data. It is based on colored Petri nets and a newly proposed concept called Service Net. The proposed method represents both data relations and service composition rules with colored Petri nets. If a business requirement is given with input/output data, we convert the Service Net into a reduced one, and decompose it into subnets that can be candidate composition solutions. A real-life case is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed concepts and method. Our method can be readily used in industrial web service composition for business automation.
