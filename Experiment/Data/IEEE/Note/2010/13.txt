This paper was motivated by the problem offinding optimal process parameters for the  thin film but it also applies to other different processes that need to get better process parametersby experiments. Existing approaches have trial-and-error or experimentaldesign methods. The two methods are time- and cost-consuming, and couldnot guarantee to find the good process parameters. This paper suggestsa procedure by combining both modeling and optimization methods tosolve this problem. We employ the Taguchi method, the ANN, and theGA to search for the optimal process parameters for a  thin film inthe vacuum sputtering process. The result is quite promising. In futureresearch, we will improve the adopted methods and apply the approach toother problems for optimal process parameters design.
