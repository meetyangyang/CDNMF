performs a single lot scheduling at the time of lot arrival and start of processing. The proposed method is suitable for real-time production control in order to reduce the redundant blocking time by correcting the start timings of all operations at the upstream equipment unit. In this paper, we show an implementation of the proposed method on an event-driven simulator and then experimentally show that the proposed method solves the problems of redundant blocking time which occur when the conventional method is used.
