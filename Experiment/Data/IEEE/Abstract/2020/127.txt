Virtual sensors have established themselves as effective tools in process industries for online estimating variables that are crucial but difficult to measure. However;  multimode industrial processes render developing high-accuracy virtual sensors quite challenging. The main difficulties lie in that;  in multimode processes;  the distributions of process data are strongly non-Gaussian and the mathematical relationships between the explanatory and primary variables are highly nonlinear. Even within one operating mode;  the primary variables could depend on the explanatory variables in nonlinear ways. In order to address these issues;  this article proposes a virtual sensing approach named Bayesian nonlinear Gaussian mixture regression (BNGMR) with the aid of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). In the BNGMR;  a fully Bayesian model structure that absorbs the merits of SLFNs and the mixture models is designed. In addition;  we develop a training algorithm for the BNGMR to realize predictive virtual sensor development based on variational inference. Extensive assessments of the performance of the BNGMR are carried out using both artificial example and real-world industrial processes. The experiments have demonstrated the predictive advantage of the BNGMR over several benchmark methods and also have provided practitioners with good illustrations.
