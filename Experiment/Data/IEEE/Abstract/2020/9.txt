This paper presents a method based on frequency shift feedback for living cell manipulation and in situ nano-injection with a cantilevered micropipette probe (CMP). This method can detect tip-cell interactive forces at the piconewton level by measuring the frequency shift of the rigid CMP oscillated in the first bending eigenmode (amplitude: ~10 nm). Different interaction states throughout the process of manipulation and injection;  including the contact;  gripping;  detaching;  and cell (nuclear) membrane penetration;  can be well detected and thereby controlled. In addition;  the cell adhesion can be quantified by the integral of the frequency shift during the detachment process. Manipulation and nanoinjection are automatically performed using two types of CMPs with different apex aperture diameters (manipulation: Ø4 μm; nanoinjection: Ø200 nm);  under the control of the dynamic force and microscope vision feedback. The proposed method can control the contact force of ~ 300 pn for nondestructive cell manipulation and can detect cell membrane (~250 pn) and nuclear membrane (~400 pn) penetration forces in nanoinjection. The versatility and robustness of the proposed method are further demonstrated by quantifying the cellsubstrate adhesion;  the building of cell patterns;  and automated cell nanoinjection.
