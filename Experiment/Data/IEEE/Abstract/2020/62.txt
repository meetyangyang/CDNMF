Learning control is investigated to solve the tracking problem for linear systems via unreliable networks with random data dropouts. By using an encoding-decoding mechanism-based finite-level uniform quantizer;  the communication burden is remarkably reduced while retaining a precise tracking performance. An intermittent update principle is adopted in both the encoding-decoding mechanism and the learning control algorithm to handle the effects of data dropouts. A special case;  in which no consecutive dropouts exist along the iteration axis;  is provided first and then extended to a general case;  in which bounded consecutive data dropouts are allowed. A precise analysis of the maximum range of the finite-level quantizer and the associated asymptotical convergence is conducted. Illustrative simulations demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework.
