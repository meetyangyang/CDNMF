We present stability and control analysis of a rider- bicycle system under human steering and body movements. The dynamic model of rider-bicycle interactions is first constructed to integrate the rider's body movement with the moving bicycle platform. We then present human balance control strategies based on human riding experiments. The closed-loop system stability is analyzed and discussed. Quantitative influences of the bicycle physical parameters;  the human control gains;  and the time delays are also analyzed and discussed. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the human control models and demonstrate human balance performance using the bikebot;  an instrumented bicycle platform. The presented modeling and analysis results can be potentially used for further development of bicycle-assisted rehabilitation for postural balance patients.
