Industrial processes generally have various operation modes;  and fault detection for such processes is important. This paper proposes a method that integrates a variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with canonical correlation analysis (VBGMM-CCA) for efficient multimode process monitoring. The proposed VBGMM-CCA method maximizes the advantage of VBGMM in automatic mode identification and the superiority of CCA in local fault detection. First;  VBGMM is applied to unlabeled historical process data to determine the number of operation modes and cluster the data in each mode. Second;  local CCA models that explore input and output relationships are established. Fault detection residuals are generated in each local CCA model;  and monitoring statistics are derived. Finally;  a Bayesian inference probability index that integrates monitoring results from all local models is developed to increase the monitoring robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring scheme is verified through experimental studies on a numerical example and the multiphase batch-fed penicillin fermentation process.
