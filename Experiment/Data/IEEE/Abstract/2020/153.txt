We present a Bayesian linear random effects' model for variation source identification in multistage manufacturing processes with a prior for sparse variance components. A modified horseshoe+ (HS+) prior is used to tackle high-dimensional problems with low sample size and sparse variation sources. Furthermore;  we introduce the informed HS+ (IHS+) prior that incorporates the likelihood information of possible variation sources. To estimate the variations from the IHS+ prior;  a specially designed Gibbs sampler is established. Through a series of numerical experiments and case study;  we showed that the proposed IHS+ outperforms the existing prior distributions when variation sources are sparse.
