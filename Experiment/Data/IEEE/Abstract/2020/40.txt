Because of the worldwide aging population;  more and more elders suffer from dementia problem. Nowadays;  it is an inconvenient and time-consuming process for medical doctors to diagnose elders who live independently with possible dementia because the process imposes a large quantity of diagnostic questions from a checklist that needs to be answered by elders themselves or their caregivers either directly or after a long-term observation. In order to help doctors to make this diagnostic process easier;  this article proposes a supporting system that can quickly estimate the likelihood for an elder of having dementia based on 2 to 4 hours monitoring of a behavioral test done by the elder. During the test;  the elder only needs to perform certain activities selected from the so-called instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in a smart home environment;  and their movement trajectories will be extracted from motion sensors deployed in the smart home environment and be analyzed to find a potential correlation with the indoor wandering patterns. A machine learning algorithm is selected to carry out the classification task;  namely;  into dementia and nondementia groups;  based on our proposed features of the aforementioned wandering patterns. Two data sets are employed for performance evaluation;  where the first one is 232 elders including seven dementia;  whereas the second one is collected by ourselves from a senior center;  which is 30 elders including nine dementia. It turns out that the average precision and recall for the first data set are both up to 98.3% with area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) being 0.846;  and those for the second data set are 89.9% and 90.0% with AUC-ROC being 0.921.
