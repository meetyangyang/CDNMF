The increasing demand for flexibility in automated production systems also affects the automated material flow systems (aMFSs) within these systems and;  thus;  demands reconfigurable systems. However;  the centralized control concept usually applied in aMFSs hinders easy adaptation;  as the entire control software has to be retested when subparts of the control are manually changed. As adaption and subsequent testing are time-consuming tasks;  concepts are required for splitting the control from one centralized node to multiple;  decentralized control nodes. Therefore;  this article presents a holistic;  agent-based control concept for aMFSs;  whereby the system is divided into so-called automated material flow modules (aMFMs);  each controlled by a dedicated module agent. The concept allows reconfiguring an aMFS consisting of heterogeneous;  stationary aMFMs;  during runtime. Furthermore;  it includes aspects such as uniform agent knowledge bases through metamodel-based development;  a communication ontology considering different information types and properties;  strategic route optimization in decentralized control architectures;  and a visualization concept to make decisions of the module agents comprehensible to operators and maintenance staff. We performed the concept evaluation using material flow simulations and a prototypical implementation on a lab-sized demonstrator.
