This article is devoted to the study and the control of a multimodal transportation system (MTS) modeled by colored hybrid Petri nets (CHPNs) and (max;  +) algebra. The studied MTS is composed of multiple connected stations served by large capacity transportation modes (such as trains and subways) and a finite number of bus shuttles with limited capacities that ensure the exchange of passengers between these stations. The MTS is studied in this article as a hybrid dynamical system (HDS). A nonstationary linear (max;  +) model based on the CHPN model representing the behavior of the MTS is developed by taking into account the delays of bus shuttles that may be caused by unpredictable incidents (such as breakdowns and accidents). Through the resultant model;  we analyze the system evolution over time and evaluate arrival/departure times of transportation means to/from the various connected stations and also passengers waiting times. In addition;  an optimal control approach regarding just-in-time criterion is proposed to optimize two crucial parameters;  namely: waiting times of passengers at the connected stations and the number of bus shuttles to be deployed on the network. In addition;  the ability of the adapted control approach to deal with bus shuttle delays caused by unpredictable incidents and how the impact of these delays on passengers waiting times can be prevented will be studied. Finally;  some relevant scenarios will be studied and discussed in order to illustrate and validate the suggested approach.
