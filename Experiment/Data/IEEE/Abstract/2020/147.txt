An airline crew rostering problem (ACRP) is one of the most important problems in an airline planning process. It aims at determining an optimal assignment of pairings;  which refer to sequences of flights starting from and ending at the same crew base;  to aircrew to form roster lines. In practice;  ACRP is subject to various types of constraints. We present a constraint-implicit mathematical model taking into account the basic;  horizontal;  and vertical constraints. In order to solve a kind of ACRP;  we propose a construction-based variable neighborhood search (VNS) framework that can build rosters effectively. Three construction methods;  i.e.;  crew-by-crew;  pairing-by-pairing;  and orthogonal constructions;  are introduced. To evaluate our approaches;  we conduct extensive experiments on two scenarios (intense and light workload) of instances originated from a Chinese airline company and make comparisons among different VNS approaches. The computational results show that the proposed approaches are capable of producing high-quality solutions in both scenarios.
