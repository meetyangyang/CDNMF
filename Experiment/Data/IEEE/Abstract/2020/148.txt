Nonlinear process fault detection remains a challenge;  with representation learning being a key step. In this article;  a deep neural network (DNN)-based discriminative representation learning approach is proposed to achieve efficient fault detection for nonlinear plant-wide processes. An early-stage fault rarely affects several independent variables concurrently; hence;  mutual information-based block division and randomized fault construction are performed to generate faulty validation data. By using the training data from the normal operation training data and the constructed validation data;  a DNN with stacked autoencoders and a softmax classifier is trained to generate discriminative representations that maximize the capability of discriminating normal and abnormal statuses. Finally;  on the basis of the learned deep discriminative representations;  support vector data description is employed to discriminate the normal and abnormal process statuses. The proposed monitoring approach is tested on a numerical example and an industrial tail-gas treatment process;  through which the efficiency is verified.
