As a class of underactuated systems;  cooperative dual rotary crane systems (DRCSs) are widely used to complete the task of large payload transportation in complex environments;  since the working capacity of single cranes is quite limited. However;  the control issues of DRCS fail to receive enough attention at present. Compared with single cranes;  DRCSs contain more state variables;  geometric constraints;  and coupling relationships. Therefore;  the complex kinematic and dynamic characteristics make controller design/stability analysis very challenging for DRCS. In order to solve these problems;  based on the dynamic model of DRCS established by Lagrange's method;  an output feedback control method with consideration for actuator constraints is designed to realize accurate dual boom positioning and rapid elimination of payload swings. The stability of the equilibrium point for the closed-loop system is analyzed by using Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle's invariance principle. To the best of our knowledge;  this article yields the first solution for effective control of DRCS;  which needs no velocity feedback;  respects the actuator constraints;  and is designed and analyzed without linearizing the complicated nonlinear dynamic equations. Finally;  a series of hardware experiments on a self-built experimental platform is carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
