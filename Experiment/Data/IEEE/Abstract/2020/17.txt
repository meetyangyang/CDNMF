This paper studies the precedence-constrained task assignment problem for a team of heterogeneous vehicles to deliver packages to a set of dispersed customers subject to precedence constraints that specify which customers need to be visited before which other customers. A truck and a micro drone with complementary capabilities are employed where the truck is restricted to travel in a street network and the micro drone;  restricted by its loading capacity and operation range;  can fly from the truck to perform the last-mile package deliveries. The objective is to minimize the time to serve all the customers respecting every precedence constraint. The problem is shown to be NP-hard;  and a lower bound on the optimal time to serve all the customers is constructed by using tools from graph theory. Then;  integrating with a topological sorting technique;  several heuristic task assignment algorithms are proposed to solve the task assignment problem. Numerical simulations show the superior performances of the proposed algorithms compared with popular genetic algorithms.
