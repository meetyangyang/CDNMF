Since the deterioration process can be controlled by freshness-keeping efforts;  we study the joint freshness-keeping;  ordering;  and pricing problems for perishable inventory systems. This problem is modeled as a series of nonlinear programming for different cases;  from which the optimal single-period freshness-keeping;  ordering;  and pricing policies are derived analytically by using the Kuhn-Tucker condition. Then;  an algorithm is proposed to implement the policies in real time with little computational efforts. We find a criterion function to evaluate whether it is appropriate to employ freshness-keeping effort. In some scenarios where products deteriorate at a high rate;  the freshness-keeping policy depends on the inventory level and has a piecewise structure. When the inventory level is not too high or too low;  it is appropriate to employ freshness-keeping effort; otherwise;  it is not. The pricing decreases in inventory items;  and finally;  reach a constant. The order policy has (s;  S)-type structure. Based on the solution of the single-period problem;  we investigate the stochastic problem over an infinite horizon;  where the randomness in both demand and deterioration processes is considered. For the stochastics case;  approximately dynamic programming is employed to obtain a joint near-optimal policy. Finally;  sensitive analysis for some key parameters is conducted to evaluate their impacts on the joint policy and effectiveness of the algorithm;  based on which some insights are revealed for the inventory management of perishable systems.
