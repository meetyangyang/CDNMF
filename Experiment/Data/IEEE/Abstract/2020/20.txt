Being able to detect;  identify;  and diagnose a fault is a key feature of industrial supervision systems;  which enables advance asset management;  in particular;  predictive maintenance;  which greatly increases efficiency and productivity. In this paper;  an Industrial Internet app for real-time fault detection and diagnosis is implemented and tested in a pilot scale industrial motor. Real-time fault detection and identification is based on dynamic incremental principal component analysis (DIPCA) and reconstruction-based contribution (RBC). When the analysis indicates that one of the vibration measurements is responsible for the fault;  a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to identify the unbalance or bearing fault type. The application was evaluated in its three functionalities: fault detection;  fault identification;  and fault identification of vibration-related faults;  yielding a fault detection rate over 99%;  a false alarm rate below 5%;  and an identification accuracy over 90%.
