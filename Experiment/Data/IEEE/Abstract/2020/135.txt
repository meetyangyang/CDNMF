This article discusses the guide path design of automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems for which we propose a model that incorporates a dynamic multicommodity flow with capacity constraints from a pickup to a delivery point. The problem is formulated as the selection of a guide path connecting a given set of pickup/delivery points. A cell-based local search that is based on an original neighborhood technique is developed. In the proposed method;  the guide path is effectively optimized based on a local search of cell-based neighborhood search preserving connectivity constraints and the subsequent solution of a dynamic multicommodity flow problem. The performance of the proposed method is strengthened by the redundant elimination of arcs and intensification of search according to the concept of the flow-concentrated cell. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing it with a general-purpose solver and recent algorithms for fixed-charge capacitated multicommodity network design problems. A real case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by using simulation software.
