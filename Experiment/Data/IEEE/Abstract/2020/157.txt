Zone-controlled;  guidepath-based transport system (ZC-GBTS) is a modeling abstraction that has been used extensively for the modeling of the safe interaction of a number of agents that circulate in a constricted medium. The traffic scheduling problem in these transport systems is very hard;  and in some recent work of ours;  we have proposed a model predictive control (MPC) scheme for simplifying this problem. The detailed implementation of this MPC scheme depends on certain structural and operational properties of the underlying ZC-GBTS. In this article;  we detail the aforementioned MPC scheme for a ZC-GBTS subclass that is characterized as “open and irreversible”; the presented results leverage some earlier similar developments of ours for the subclass of “open and reversible” ZC-GBTS.
