This paper presents a novel high-level centralized control scheme for a smart network of greenhouses integrated microgrid (NGIM) forming a smart small power grid in the context of smart grids. The main purpose is to present an innovative control strategy-based coordinated model predictive control (MPC) that considers fluctuations of stochastic renewable sources as well as weather conditions. A comprehensive finite-horizon scheduling optimization model is formulated to optimally control the operation of the NGIM;  which integrates both forecasts and newly updated information collected from the available sensors at the network level. The model can be implemented as a supervisory control and energy management system for the NGIM to manipulate the indoor climate and optimize the crop production. The cooperation is reached through a bidirectional communication infrastructure;  where a master central controller is available at the network level and is in charge of coordinating and managing various control signals. An MPC-based algorithm is used for the future operation scheduling of all subsystems available in the NGIM. The MPC strategy is tested through a case study where the influences of climate data on the operation of the NGIM are analyzed via numerical results.
