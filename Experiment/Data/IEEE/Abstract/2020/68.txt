The operational variables used to adjust the control level of the copper cleaner flotation process have a noticeable impact on the object variables;  e.g.;  the copper concentrate grade. Currently;  due to the complexity of the flotation process;  the operational variables;  which are controlled by operators;  are often not adjusted properly in time. Hence;  this article investigates an intelligent operational adjustment framework based on a hybrid Bayesian network (BN). The offline BN model structure and the parameters are established based on process knowledge and real industrial data;  respectively. After receiving the expected value of the copper concentrate grade as evidence;  an operational adjustment can be obtained online by BN reasoning. To ensure its credibility;  the copper concentrate grade after operational adjustment is further predicted. According to the predicted value;  the operators can determine whether to implement the operational adjustment or not. Finally;  the experimental results show the effectiveness and practical significance of the proposed method.
