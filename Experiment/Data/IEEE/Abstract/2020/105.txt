Opacity is a property of a system that captures whether certain event sequences (or certain states) are indistinguishable from other event sequences (or states) in the system. Opacity is used in analyzing privacy;  secrecy;  and other aspects of systems modeled by discrete-event systems. In this paper;  we introduce the concept of minimal information release policies for non-opacity and the concept of mixed opacity. Mixed opacity policies are introduced as a holistic approach for solving problems that involve a combination of releasing information to make some objectives of the system opaque while making some other objectives non-opaque. We present a set of algorithms for information release under a mixed opacity policy. These algorithms compute policies in a system such that two given sublanguages are opaque;  and at the same time;  two other sublanguages in the same system are non-opaque. The application of mixed opacity is demonstrated on the Dining Cryptographers Problem.
