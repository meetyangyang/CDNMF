Pose estimation with state or measurement constraints has been frequent in autonomous vehicle navigation. Aiming at incorporating constraints inherently;  this article proposes a dynamic potential field (DPF)-based formulation to represent states;  measurements;  and constraints on connected Riemannian manifolds. The state equation and the output equation are derived in the DPF forms;  which imply the probabilistic inference with states and measurements. Constraints are incorporated by projecting points toward a constraint subset in the state space and the measurement space;  where the DPF representing constraints is created. An information fusion scheme has been designed for DPFs;  which are obtained from multisensor measurements and constraints. KITTI and self-collected sequences have been used in experiments;  during which it is observed that the rotational drift is corrected and translational errors are reduced;  thanks to the fusion of stereo visual odometry (SVO);  heading measurements;  and road maps.
