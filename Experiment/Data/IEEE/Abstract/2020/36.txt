We propose a novel subsurface pipeline mapping and 3D reconstruction method by fusing ground-penetrating radar (GPR) scans and camera images. To facilitate the simultaneous detection of multiple pipelines;  we model the GPR sensing process and prove hyperbola response for general scanning with nonperpendicular angles. Furthermore;  we fuse visual simultaneous localization and mapping outputs;  encoder readings with GPR scans to classify hyperbolas into different pipeline groups. We extensively apply the J-linkage method and maximum likelihood estimation with error analysis to improve algorithm robustness and accuracy. As a result;  we optimally estimate the radii and locations of all pipelines. We have implemented our method and tested it in physical experiments with representative pipeline configurations. Two different kinds of 3-m-long pipes are used;  with radii being 4.62 and 3.02 cm;  respectively. The results show that our method successfully reconstructs all subsurface pipes. Moreover;  the average estimation errors for two orientation angles of pipelines are 1.73° and 0.73°;  respectively. The average localization error is 4.47 cm.
