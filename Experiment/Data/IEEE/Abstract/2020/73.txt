Multiple mobile robots in formation are often required to dock to each other to overcome the limitations;  such as battery failure;  transportation capacity;  and maneuverability on rough terrains; however;  it is challenging to design a single controller that navigates the robots to dock to each other;  maintains the other robots in formation;  and is applicable to both docked and nondocked robots;  while it is also robust to uncertainties and disturbances. This article proposes a novel robust subsumption architecture for nonholonomic mobile robots in formation with docking capability. In addition to docking;  the robots;  i.e.;  all the nondocked robots and the front-docked robots;  maintain a formation that can also be switched automatically to other configurations when necessary and avoid collisions with other robots and dynamic obstacles. The proposed subsumption control architecture takes into account each follower's desired goal as well as its docking condition to synthesize a control law as a velocity control signal that is then used to determine the robust input torque for each follower using the robots' dynamics. The Lyapunov stability of the controller is also proved. We also develop strategies for efficient centralized motion planning of the followers to achieve various goals;  e.g.;  formation keeping/switching;  docking;  and collision avoidance. The effectiveness of our proposed methodology was verified in simulations as well as implementations on a virtual robot environment.
