The block relocation problem (BRP) is a fundamental operational issue in modern warehouse and yard management;  which;  however;  is very challenging to solve. In this article;  to advance our understanding of this problem and to provide substantial assistance to practice;  we adopt the following: 1) introduce a classification scheme and present a rather comprehensive review on all 16 BRP variants; 2) develop a general framework to derive lower bounds on the number of necessary relocations and demonstrate its connection to existing lower bounds on the unrestricted BRP variants; 3) propose and employ a couple of new critical substructure concepts to analyze the BRP and obtain a lower bound that dominates all existing ones; 4) build a new and strong mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation that is adaptable to compute eight BRP variants;  and design a novel MIP-formulation-based iterative procedure to compute exact BRP solutions; and 5) extend the MIP formulation to address four typical industrial considerations. Computational results on standard and practical test instances show that the new lower bound is significantly stronger;  and our new MIP computational methods have superior performances over the state-of-the-art formulation and a heuristic adopted in a steel plant.
