Nonstationary variations widely exist in abnormal industrial processes;  in which the mean values and variances of the fault nonstationary variables change with time. Thus;  the stationary fault information may be buried by nonstationary fault variations resulting in high misclassification rate for fault diagnosis. Besides;  the existing fault diagnosis methods do not consider underlying relations among different fault classes;  which may lose important classification information. Here;  it is recognized that different faults may not only share some common information but also have some specific characteristics. A fault diagnosis strategy with dual analysis of common and specific nonstationary fault variations is proposed here. The nonstationary variables and stationary variables are first separated using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Then common and specific information is analyzed for fault diagnosis. Two models are developed;  in which;  the fault-common model is constructed by cointegration analysis (CA) to capture common nonstationary fault variations;  and the fault-specific model is built to capture specific fault nonstationary variations of each fault class. With dual consideration of common and specific fault characteristics;  the classification accuracy and fault diagnosis performance can be greatly improved. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated with both a well-known benchmark process and a real industrial process.
