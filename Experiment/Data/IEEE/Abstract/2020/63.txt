Target tracking has been considered as one of the most important applications of underwater acoustic sensor networks. However;  the long propagation delay;  high-energy consumption;  and strong noise properties of the underwater environment make target tracking more challenging as compared with terrestrial sensor networks. This article is concerned with an energy-efficient tracking issue for underwater targets;  subject to an asynchronous clock;  power restriction;  and noise measurement constraints. The tracking process can be divided into two phases;  i.e.;  position acquisition and persistent tracking. In the first phase;  we establish the relationship between propagation delay and position;  through which an asynchronous localization algorithm is developed for sensor nodes to estimate the position of target. Based on the estimated position;  a consensus-based Bayesian filter is designed for sensor nodes in the second phase to enable persistent tracking. In particular;  the consensus fusion strategy and duty-cycle mechanism are jointly adopted to improve the tracking accuracy and prolong the network lifetime. Moreover;  the convergence analyses for the proposed approach are also presented. Finally;  simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed tracking approach can reduce the influence of malicious measurements;  while the energy efficiency can be significantly improved as compared with the other works.
