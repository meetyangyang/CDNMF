Accurate modeling of a thermal field is one of the fundamental requirements in engineering thermal management in numerous industries. Existing studies have shown that using differential equations to model a thermal field delivers good performance when the parameters are predetermined through physical or experimental analysis. However;  due to variations of the inner medium affected by certain latent factors;  the parameters in differential equation models may not be treated as constants while the thermal field is estimated;  and this fact poses a new challenge to field estimation by directly solving the differential equation models. In this study;  a novel approach to thermal field modeling is developed by considering the parameters as functional variables that vary temporally in partial differential equations (PDEs). This approach provides a new perspective to model the dynamic thermal field by fully using the collected sensor data from the thermal system. Specifically;  time-varying parameters can be constructed through a combination of basis functions whose coefficients can be efficiently estimated through the sensor data. A two-level iterative parameter estimation algorithm is also tailored to obtain the parameters in the PDE model. Both simulation and real case studies show that our proposed approach provides satisfactory estimation performance compared with the benchmark method that uses the constant parameter estimation.
