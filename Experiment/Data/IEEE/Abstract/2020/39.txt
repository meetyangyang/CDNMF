3-D registration has always been performed invoking singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) in real engineering practices. However;  these numerical algorithms suffer from uncertainty of convergence in many cases. A novel fast symbolic solution is proposed in this article by following our recent publication in this journal. The equivalence analysis shows that our previous solver can be converted to deal with the 3-D registration problem. Rather;  the computation procedure is studied for further simplification of computing without complex-number support. Experimental results show that the proposed solver does not loose accuracy and robustness but improves the execution speed to a large extent by almost 50%-80%;  on both a personal computer (PC) and an embedded processor.
