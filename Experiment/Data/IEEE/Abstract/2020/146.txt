Pneumatic cylinder drives are widely used in automation technology-mainly for two reasons: They are cheap to acquire and easy to handle. At the same time;  it is well known that there is a significant potential of energy savings when changing the control pattern from a standard scheme toward a task-specific scheme. In order to maintain a reliable operation and low wear of pneumatic cylinders;  it is essential not to exceed the manufacturer's specifications on kinetic impact energy at stroke end. Lowering the kinetic impact energy is typically done either by external shock absorbers (increasing the acquisition cost and requiring installation space) or internal solutions;  i.e.;  pneumatic cushioning systems. In this article;  we give a comprehensively identified and validated model extension to common modeling approaches for pneumatic cylinder drives regarding pneumatic end cushioning systems. Based on this model;  we analyze;  optimize;  and evaluate the potential and applicability of energy-saving control strategies for pneumatic cylinder drives in the context of internal pneumatic cushioning systems. The results illustrate the large savings potential and point out which strategy is best to use for a specific application.
