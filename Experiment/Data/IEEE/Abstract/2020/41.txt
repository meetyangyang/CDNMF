This article deals with the problem of discovering a Petri net (PN) model of a discrete-event system;  starting from the observation of long-event sequences. Precisely;  given an interpreted PN (IPN) system modeling the relations between input and output events of the system (i.e.;  the reactive/observable behavior);  the internal state evolutions of the system (i.e.;  the unobservable behavior) are first discovered and then modeled. The proposed unobservable discovery takes advantage of the novel concept of interpreted sequences;  which better characterize the system and model the behavior by considering both observable markings (outputs) and transition firings (inputs). The unobservable modeling is approached as a net synthesis problem. It relies on an optimization-based procedure that identifies the complementary structure; in particular;  places only are added to the original model.
