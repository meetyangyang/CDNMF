The integration of condition monitoring with queueing systems to support decision making is not well explored. This paper addresses the impact of condition monitoring of the server on the system-level performance experienced by entities in a queueing system. The system consists of a queue with a single-server subject to Markovian degradation. The model assumes a Poisson arrival process with service times and repair times according to general distributions. We develop stability conditions and perform steady-state analysis to obtain performance measures (average queue length;  average degradation;  and so on). We propose minimizing an objective function involving four types of costs: repair;  catastrophic failure;  quality;  and holding. The queue performance measures derived from steady-state analysis are benchmarked and compared to those from a discrete event simulation model. After verifying the queuing model;  a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the relationships between system performance and model parameters. Results indicate that the total cost function is convex and;  thus;  subject to an optimal repair policy. The model is sensitive to service time;  quality costs;  and failure costs for late-stage policy repairs decisions and sensitive to expected repair times and repair costs for early stage policy repair decisions.
