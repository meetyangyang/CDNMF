In order to improve the robustness and optimize trajectory of projective homography-based uncalibrated visual servoing (PHUVS) proposed in our previous work;  an analytical expression of optimal trajectory for camera in projective homography space is proposed in this article;  which is totally free of camera parameters and is corresponding to camera's shortest path in the 3-D space with straight path in translation and minimal geodesic in rotation. The projective homography is computed without scale ambiguity in both planning and tracking stages. The PHUVS controller is modified correspondingly to track the planned trajectory in projective homography space while maintaining superior characteristic of PHUVS under uncalibrated scenario. The simulations and experiments' results reveal the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed trajectory optimization method in the existence of large initial errors.
