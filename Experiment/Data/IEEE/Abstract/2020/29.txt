Pulp is the most important raw material in paper industries;  whose fiber length stochastic distribution (FLSD) shaping directly determines the energy consumption and paper quality of the subsequent papermaking processes. However;  the mean and variance are insufficient to describe the FLSD shaping;  which displays non-Gaussian distributional properties. Therefore;  the traditional control method based on the mean and variance of the fiber length is difficult to control the FLSD shaping effectively. In this article;  a novel data-driven predictive probability density function (PDF) control method is proposed for the FLSD shaping in the refining process. First;  the PDF of FLSD shaping is approximated by a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and the parameters of each RBF basis function are tuned by using an iterative learning law. Second;  the random vector functional link network (RVFLN)-based data-driven modeling method is employed to construct the prediction model of the weight vector. Consequently;  the predictive controller is designed based on the constructed PDF model of the FLSD shaping in the refining process and the stability issue of the resulted closed-loop system is discussed. The experiments using industrial data are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
