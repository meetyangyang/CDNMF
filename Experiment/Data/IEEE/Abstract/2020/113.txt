Deadlock is a rather undesirable case in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). The appearance of deadlock can cause the partial or total stagnation of a system. So far;  a large number of deadlock control policies have been developed; nevertheless;  the majority are dependent on the assumption that allocated resources cannot break down. In the real world;  an AMS consists of a set of concurrent production routes that share and compete for a limited number of resources;  such as automated material/component handling devices;  buffers;  robots;  and machines. Resource failures occur unexpectedly. If reasonable control does not exist;  a simple resource failure can lead an entire system to stagnation;  which can cause enormous economic loss. Therefore;  researchers have gradually paid attention to AMSs allowing resource failures in recent years. In this paper;  we focus on reviewing and comparing various robust supervisory control policies from the perspective of their structural complexity;  behavioral permissiveness;  and computational complexity. Some potential future directions are explored. This paper provides a reference source of robust supervisory control of AMSs for researchers and practitioners in this area.
