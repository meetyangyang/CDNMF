Goal: In the context of robot-assisted laminectomy surgery;  an analytical force model is introduced to guarantee procedural safety. The aim of the method is to intraoperatively monitor the cutting depth via modeling the milling status. Methods: The theoretical dynamic model for the surgical milling process is based on the flute geometry of the ball-end milling tool. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is exploited to calibrate the model using the local average force;  and to validate it using the denoised dynamic force. A wear detection method based on the fast Fourier transform is proposed to determine the quality of the tool geometry and to avoid using worn tools;  which may lead to imprecise and unsafe operations. Results: Milling experiments were performed on machined fresh bovine femur bones. The experimental results thus obtained from the mechanical model are in good accordance with the numerical model. The proposed method can monitor the current cutting depth with an accuracy of ±0.1 mm in regions located within the depth [0.8-1.2 mm];  and ±0.2 mm within [1.2-1.6 mm]. Conclusion: The proposed model can successfully estimate the milling force and the cutting depth intraoperatively in experimental conditions. Significance: This approach has the potential to improve the safety of laminectomy operations in humans;  and make it more accessible to younger surgeons by lowering the required manual skills threshold.
