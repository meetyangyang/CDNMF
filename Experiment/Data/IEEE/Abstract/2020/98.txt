In this paper;  a variation of the congestion situation is considered and a new game;  the congestion game with player-specific (CGPS) utility functions;  is proposed. This paper is motivated by some application scenarios that rule out the possibility of employing the existing game model to study such congestion situations. The CGPS game is characterized by adding a player-specific term and a weighted parameter with respect to the utility function. By using the semitensor product of matrices;  the algebraic representation of the CGPS game is given and the existence of the weighted potential function is proved. Finally;  the results are applied to solve the service chain composition problem in network function virtualization (NFV) and to analyze the effect of player-specific function on service chain configuration in NFV.
