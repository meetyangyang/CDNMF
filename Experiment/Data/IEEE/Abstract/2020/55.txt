Software-intensive cyber-physical systems (CPS) perform essential tasks such as controlling automated production processes in industrial production plants. The required levels of autonomy;  openness;  and self-adaptation;  as well as the dynamic nature of the context of such CPS;  result in challenging tasks for their engineering. During operation;  unexpected situations in which the system has insufficient knowledge about the current state of the system itself as well as its context may occur. Engineering CPS;  e.g.;  for industrial production sites;  must account for such uncertainties the system will have to cope with during its lifetime in a structured and systematic way. Since the development of CPS requires consideration of different system perspectives;  current uncertainty modeling approaches cannot be applied right away;  as they do not explicitly consider uncertainty aspects that affect different artifacts. To aid the engineering of CPS;  this article presents a model-based approach to document uncertainty. We propose “Orthogonal Uncertainty Models; ” which closely integrate with other engineering artifacts from different perspectives;  as a means for capturing a dedicated uncertainty viewpoint. Our approach has been evaluated in the industry automation domain. The application shows that the idea of regarding uncertainty within a dedicated perspective is highly beneficial. Particularly;  our approach helps to uncover and document uncertainties related to behavioral;  functional;  and structural properties of a system;  as well as uncertainties related to business models that would otherwise possibly remain covert.
