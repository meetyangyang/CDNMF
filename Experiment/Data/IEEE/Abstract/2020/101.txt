Though intercell scheduling problems have been studied in the literature;  extant algorithms can hardly come into play in practice. This is because of two reasons: 1) transportation among cells;  which is important for practical intercell scheduling;  has not been adequately considered and 2) the problem size is large in practice;  which may lead to intolerable computation efficiency. The motivation of this paper is to automatically design intercell scheduling heuristics that are suitable for practical application. A genetic programming algorithm with a pretraining strategy (GP-PS) is proposed. Production within cells and transportation among cells are simultaneously considered;  and a cooperative coevolutionary framework is designed. To evolve better heuristics;  a PS is developed. A speedup strategy is designed to accelerate the evolutionary process. Comparative experiments are conducted with other GP-based algorithms;  speedup strategies;  and with some state-of-the-art intercell scheduling algorithms. GP-PS is also put into use in a large manufacturing enterprise of China. Computational experiments and application results both verify the effectiveness of GP-PS.
