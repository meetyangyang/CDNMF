This paper studies a hot rolling batch scheduling problem in compact strip production (CSP);  which is decomposed into a two-stage problem. The first stage is the strip combination problem aimed at determining the strip combination of each rolling turn and the number of rolling turns with the objective of minimizing the number of virtual strips;  and the second is the strip allocation and sequencing problem aimed at optimizing the allocation and rolling sequence of the strips in each rolling turn. We first model this two-stage problem considering a set of production constraints and then design an optimal approach to solve the strip combination problem. Subsequently;  we design an evolutionary algorithm (i.e.;  artificial bee colony algorithm) with a novel search strategy for employed bees;  a dynamic strategy for onlooker bees;  a variable neighborhood search strategy for a scout bee;  and an enhanced strategy to solve the problem in the second stage. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
