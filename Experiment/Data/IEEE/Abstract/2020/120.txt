Microrobotic delivery possesses a promising perspective for precision medicine and has attracted much attention recently. However;  its automation remains challenging;  especially with complex environmental conditions;  such as obstacles and obstructed optical feedback. In this article;  we propose an automated control approach for a new type of magnetic microrobot;  i.e.;  the multifunctional magnetic spore (Mag-Spore);  which has good potential for targeted delivery. By the surface functionalization of the spore with Fe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sub>\nO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>4</sub>\n nanoparticles and carbon quantum dots (QDs);  it can be remotely actuated and tracked by an electromagnetic coil system and the fluorescence microscopy;  respectively. Our control approach uses fluorescence imaging for vision feedback;  which enhances the recognition and tracking of Mag-Spores;  obstacles;  and cells. Then;  information of the obstacles;  targeted cells;  and Mag-Spores for planning and control is identified by image processing;  and an optimal path planner with obstacle-avoidance capability is designed based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. To make the Mag-Spore follow the planed path accurately;  a robust model predictive trajectory-tracking controller is synthesized. Simulations are conducted to validate the proposed control approach and tune the control parameters. Experiments demonstrate the effective targeted delivery of the Mag-Spore by using the proposed automated control method under the guidance of fluorescence imaging.
