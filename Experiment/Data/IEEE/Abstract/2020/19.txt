A machine's degradation status directly influences the operational performance of the production system;  such as productivity and product quality. For example;  machines associated with different health states may have different remaining life before failure;  thus impacting the system throughput. Therefore;  it is critical to analyze the coupling between the overall system performance and the machine degradation to better production decision-making;  such as maintenance and product dispatch decisions. In this paper;  we propose a novel model to evaluate the production performance of a two-machine-and-one-buffer line;  given the real-time machine degradation signals. Specifically;  a phase-type distribution-based continuous-time Markov chain model is formulated to estimate the system throughput by utilizing the remaining life prediction from the degradation signals. A case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.
