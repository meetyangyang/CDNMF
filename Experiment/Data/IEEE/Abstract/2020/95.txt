Video and image sources are frequently applied in the area of defect inspection in industrial community. For the recognition and classification of sewer defects;  a significant number of videos and images of sewers are collected. These data are then checked by human and some traditional methods to recognize and classify the sewer defects;  which is inefficient and error-prone. Previously developed features like SIFT are unable to comprehensively represent such defects. Therefore;  feature representation is especially important for defect autoclassification. In this paper;  we study the automatic extraction of feature representation for sewer defects via deep learning. Moreover;  a complete automatic system for classifying sewer defects is proposed built on a two-level hierarchical deep convolutional neural network;  which shows high performance with respect to classification accuracy. The proposed network is trained on a novel data set with over 40 000 sewer images. The system has been successfully applied in the practical production;  confirming its robustness and feasibility to real-world applications. The source code and trained model are available at the project website.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>1</sup>.
