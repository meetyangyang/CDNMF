We present a novel application of the variable stiffness actuator (VSA)-based assistance/rehabilitation robot-featured impedance control using a cascaded position torque control loop. The robot follows the adaptive impedance control paradigm;  thereby achieving an adaptive assistance level according to human joint torque. The feedforward human joint torque command is used to cooperatively adjust the impedance controller and the stiffness trajectory of the VSA (this functional architecture is referred to as the cooperative control framework). In this way;  the task performance during movement training can be improved regarding: 1) safety-for example;  when the subject intends to contribute considerable effort;  low-gain impedance control is activated with a low stiffness actuator to further decrease output impedance and 2) tracking performance-for example;  for the subject with less effort;  high-gain impedance control is used while pursuing high stiffness to enhance the torque bandwidth. Regarding the safety aspect;  we demonstrate that the torque controller designed at low stiffness can be sensitive to the disturbance for low output impedance while maintaining tracking performance. A precondition for this is to treat the input disturbance separately. This is guaranteed by our previously proposed torque control of the VSA using the linear quadratic Gaussian technique. This approach is also employed here;  but with additional discussion on the observer design to serve the proposed cooperative control approach. Here;  the effectiveness of the proposed control system is experimentally verified using a VSA prototype and a one-degree-of-freedom lower limb exoskeleton worn by a human test person.
