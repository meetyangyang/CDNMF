This article reports an automated optically-induced dielectrophoresis (ODEP) system for characterizing the specific membrane capacitance (SMC) of individual cells. The simulation of cell motion is conducted to analyze the electrokinetic forces acting on the cell. A self-developed visual tracking algorithm for multicells is used to realize an automated process for determining the frequency-sweeping range;  crossover frequencies;  and cell radii. The SMC values of malignant bladder cancer cells (T24 and RT4) and normal urothelial cells (SV-HUC-1) were quantified using the automated system;  demonstrating that the system has a measurement speed of ~1 cell/s;  an accuracy of 1 kHz for the crossover frequency determination;  and an accuracy of 0.2 Î¼m for the cell radius measurement.
