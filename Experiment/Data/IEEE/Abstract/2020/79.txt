A robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS) performs the order fulfillment process by bringing inventory to workers at pick-pack-and-ship warehouses. In the RMFS;  robots lift and carry shelving units;  called inventory pods;  from storage locations to picking stations where workers pick items off the pods and put them into shipping cartons. The robots then return the pods to the storage area and transport other pods. In this article;  we consider an item assignment problem in the RMFS in order to maximize the sum of similarity values of items in each pod. We especially focus on a reoptimization heuristic to address the situation where the similarity values are altered so that a good assignment solution can be obtained quickly with the changed similarity values. A constructive heuristic algorithm for the item assignment problem is developed;  and then;  a reoptimization heuristic is proposed based on the constructive heuristic algorithm. Then;  computational results for several instances of the problem with 10-500 items are presented. We further analyze the case for which an item type can be placed into two pods.
