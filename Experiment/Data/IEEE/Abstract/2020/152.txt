Disassembly is a core procedure in remanufacturing. Disassembly is currently carried out mainly by human operators. It is important to reduce the labor content of disassembly through automation;  to make remanufacturing more economically attractive. Threaded fastener removal is one of the most difficult disassembly tasks to be fully automated. This article presents a new method developed for automating the unfastening of screws. An electric nutrunner spindle with a geared offset adapter was fitted to the end of a collaborative robot. The position of a hexagonal headed screw in a fitted stage was known only approximately;  and its orientation in the hole was unknown. The robot was programed to perform a spiral search motion to engage the tool onto the screw. A control strategy combining torque and position monitoring with active compliance was implemented. An existing robot cell was modified and utilized to demonstrate the concept and to assess the feasibility of the solution using a turbocharger as a disassembly case study.
