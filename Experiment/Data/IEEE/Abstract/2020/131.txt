In general;  systems are formed by the composition of several modules;  local components;  or subsystems;  and may exhibit a large number of states. The growth of the composed model with the number of system components leads to high-computational costs for diagnosis techniques based on the composed plant model. We propose in this article a new approach for fault diagnosis that avoids the direct use of the composed system model for the diagnoser implementation;  reducing the computational cost for diagnosis. The diagnosis strategy is based on the observation of the fault-free behavior of the system components. In this regard;  we introduce the definition of synchronous diagnosability of the language of a discrete-event system (DES) with respect to the languages of its components and provide a method to verify this property. An algorithm that efficiently computes the fault-free behavior model of the system components is also proposed. We extend this approach to a decentralized architecture and introduce the definition of synchronous codiagnosability. Moreover;  a comparison between the classical definition of diagnosability;  synchronous diagnosability;  synchronous codiagnosability;  and modular diagnosability of DESs is established. The verification of synchronous diagnosability for a didactic automated system is presented to show the results of the article.
