Deadlock resolution has been an important research topic in the field of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs). Researchers generally assume that AMS resources never break down whereas only a few resolve the issues of resource failures in the discrete-event supervision of AMSs. In fact;  an AMS consists of a number of numerically controlled machines interacting with each other. The failure of resources happens unexpectedly. In this article;  we allow parallel routes to use unreliable resources. Because of their powerful modeling capabilities;  Petri nets are used to model the considered AMSs. By using a look-ahead control strategy;  a robust supervisory control policy is developed for AMSs with assembly operations allowing resource failures. Our objective is to advance parts requiring failed resources in their remaining routes into a special position so as to release shared resources in case some unreliable resources fail. Consequently;  those parts not necessarily requiring any failed resource can keep progressing all the time. The conventional methods are on the basis of monolithic and structure-oriented control specifications with centralized supervisors. Our policy can be implemented in a distributed;  online;  and local way. Several examples are given to elucidate our control policy clearly.
