3-D dynamic field modeling using data acquired from sensor networks is typically complex due to the data sparsity and missing problem. In this article;  we consider the ubiquitous missing data problem in current sensor networks and aim to take complete advantage of the existing sensor data for thermal field modeling. In the common scenario;  data from the target network are not always obtainable;  but data from other neighboring networks with homogeneous fields are accessible. Thus;  a novel method that captures the information acquired from these neighboring networks is proposed. To achieve accurate thermal field estimation using limited sensor observations;  we develop a mixed-effect model framework in which the dynamic field is decomposed into a mean profile and local variability. In particular;  we establish a spatiotemporal field multitask learning (FML) approach to identify the spatiotemporal correlation by integrating a multitask Gaussian process (MGP) framework into an autoregressive (AR) model using neighboring data sources from homogeneous fields. Our proposed method is verified through a real case study of thermal field estimation during grain storage.
