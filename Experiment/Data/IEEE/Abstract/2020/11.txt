Cloud computing has nowadays become a dominant technology to reduce the computation cost by elastically providing resources to users on a pay-per-use basis. More and more scientific and business applications represented by workflows have been moved or are in active transition to cloud platforms. Therefore;  efficient cloud workflow scheduling methods are in high demand. This paper investigates how to simultaneously optimize makespan and economical cost for workflow scheduling in clouds and proposes a multiobjective evolutionary list scheduling (MOELS) algorithm to address it. It embeds the classic list scheduling into a powerful multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA): a genome is represented by a scheduling sequence and a preference weight and is interpreted to a scheduling solution via a specifically designed list scheduling heuristic;  and the genomes in the population are evolved through tailored genetic operators. The simulation experiments with the real-world data show that MOELS outperforms some state-of-the-art methods as it can always achieve a higher hypervolume (HV) value.
