Layout of the interior works during building construction is time consuming and error prone. Given the cost involved;  both for initial layout and for later rework where errors occur;  researchers have sought to automate the layout task. Some have adopted marker-less augmented reality methods using heads-up displays or cameras;  and others have proposed robots capable of marking out the works. The former encumber the workers;  the latter are expensive to set up and are sensitive to site conditions;  and neither has yet achieved the required accuracy. In this paper;  we propose a more efficient approach to project relevant information from a building information model (BIM) onto the construction surface;  directly augmenting the construction site with the design information. This is done using a portable system consisting of a 2-D laser scanner;  an angled adjustable projector;  and a camera. The system localizes itself within the already built outer walls using the laser scanner and the BIM model using a method derived from robotic mapping; it calibrates the projection correction parameters (keystone correction) using image analysis; and it projects the information with the angled projector. Testing results showed that the localization was accurate within a few millimeters and less than 3Â°;  and the final projected image's error was approximately 1 cm. Initial calibration requires less than 1 min and does not require specialist skills. The system automates the layout task;  preserves accuracy;  and can provide rich model information on any interior surface.
