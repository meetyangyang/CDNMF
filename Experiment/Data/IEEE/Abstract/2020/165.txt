This article proposes single-objective/multiobjective cat swarm optimization clustering algorithms for data partition. The proposed methods use the cat swarm to search the optimal. The position of the cat tightly associates with the clustering centers and is updated by two submodes: the seeking mode and the tracing mode. The seeking mode uses the simulated annealing strategy to update the cat position at a probability. Inspired by the quantum theories;  the tracing mode adopts the quantum model to update the cat position in the whole solution space. First;  the single-objective method is proposed and adopts the cohesion of clustering as the objective function;  in which the kernel method is applied. For considering more objective functions to reveal diverse aspects of data;  the multiobjective method is proposed and adopts both the cohesion and the connectivity as the objective functions. The Pareto optimization method is applied to balance the objectives. In the experiments;  three kinds of data sets are used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods;  which are three synthetic data sets;  four data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository;  and a field data set. Experimental results verified that the proposed methods perform better than the traditional clustering algorithms;  and the proposed multiobjective method has the highest accuracy.
