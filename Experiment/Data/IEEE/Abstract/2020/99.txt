The steady-state detection is critically important in many engineering fields;  such as fault detection and diagnosis and process monitoring and control. However;  most of the existing methods were designed for univariate signals and;  thus;  are not effective in handling multivariate signals. In this paper;  we propose an efficient online steady-state detection method for multivariate systems through a sequential Bayesian partitioning approach. The signal is modeled by a Bayesian piecewise constant mean and covariance model;  and a recursive updating method is developed to calculate the posterior distributions analytically. The duration of the current segment is utilized for steady-state testing. Insightful guidance is also provided for hyperparameter selection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through thorough numerical and real case studies.
