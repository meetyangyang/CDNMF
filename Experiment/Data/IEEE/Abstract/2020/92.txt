In human-computer interactive systems (HCISs);  there are not only autonomous robots completely controlled by computers but also semiautonomous robots requiring human control. To avoid the errors in a procedure of interaction;  a control model is needed. This paper proposes a systematic strategy with specific algorithms to construct an interactive-control-model based on Petri nets owing to their ability to describe concurrence and other system features. Instead of cumbersome iterations of deadlock detection in the existing studies;  this paper introduces the concept of implicit constraints and the related implicit-conflict-marking-search algorithm to excavate them. In the algorithm;  only the status of a single robot is needed to analyze the system instead of the status of all system components;  which is an important innovation in this paper since this can well help one resolve the state explosion issue. Several examples are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed method. The proposed idea in this paper can be readily applied to practical HCISs.
