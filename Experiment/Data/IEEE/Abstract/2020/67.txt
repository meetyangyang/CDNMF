In this article;  an artificially weighted spanning tree coverage (AWSTC) algorithm is proposed for the distributed path planning of multiple flying robots. To balance well the efficiency;  redundancy;  and robustness in the cooperative coverage problem;  each robot simultaneously constructs its spanning tree;  which grows toward the center of inertia of the uncovered area and keeps away from the trees of its partners. Based on this;  each robot covers a concerned area with almost equal trajectory length and computational burden. To guarantee dynamical consistency;  a trajectory-smoothing method is developed utilizing BÃ©zier curve transition. As transition in the spanning tree path planning is always conducted around the corner with right angle;  geometric and velocity profiles of this kind of transition can be preevaluated as a basic component and then connected to establish more complex real-time trajectories according to the constructed spanning trees. Numerical evaluations and real-time flight experiments are carried out at last. Results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate a smooth trajectory for an area coverage problem while ensuring efficiency and robustness. In particular;  the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is quite close to the typical centralized spanning tree coverage (STC) algorithm;  while ensuring the fulfillment of the coverage task regardless of any breakdown in the individual robot.
