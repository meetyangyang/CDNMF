FlexRay offers high-speed reliable transmission in the vehicle domain. Thus;  it is one of the most popular in-vehicle communication protocols for the applications that are safety-critical or applications with very low transmission time requirement. Due to the real-time constraint;  the worst case end-to-end delay (EED) for such applications transmitting over a shared bus must be known. This paper addresses the problem of computation of EED for a given set of tasks with precedence constraint and corresponding messages;  which are scheduled with slot multiplexing for event-triggered communication over the dynamic segment of FlexRay. First;  computing precise delay has been shown to be an intractable problem. Subsequently;  motivated by the intractability;  an efficient estimation technique has been proposed to compute approximate EED. Unlike the common practice of considering the network in isolation;  we present a comprehensive timing analysis;  which considers the effects of task execution as well. Moreover;  EED is allowed to be greater than interactivation time of task graph. The extensive simulation has been performed on the test cases generated with uniform as well as normal distribution.
