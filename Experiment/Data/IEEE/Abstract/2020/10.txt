In a paired-point rigid registration;  target registration error (TRE) is deemed to be the most important quality metric. TRE usually cannot be directly measured;  and thus many TRE estimation algorithms have been proposed. However;  target localization errors (TLEs) in two spaces are not considered in the definition of TRE. In this paper;  we propose a new type of evaluation metric that is referred to as total TRE (TTRE) at a given target point with TLE incorporated. Statistics including mean;  root mean square (rms);  and covariance matrix of TTRE are derived without making any assumption of the TLE magnitude. TTRE and fiducial registration error (FRE) are proved to be uncorrelated when an ideal weighting scheme is adopted in solving the registration problem. The proposed error model is validated through extensive experiments. In the first experiment with random fiducials and targets;  in 90% of the test cases;  there shows no difference between the predicted and simulated TTRE statistics when six fiducials are used. In the second experiment of deep-brain stimulation surgery;  the mean value of CC(TTRE; FRE) being 8.9246 × 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>-4</sup>\n ± 0.0389 was observed;  which indicates that TTRE and FRE are uncorrelated. In the third experiment of surgical tool-tip tracking;  the mean and standard deviation of percentage differences between predicted and simulated TTRE rms values are 2.22% ± 0.77% for the planar tool and 2.62% ± 0.59% for the textral tool. In summary;  our proposed algorithm can well model the TTRE metric.
