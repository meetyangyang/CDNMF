To make the controller implementation easier and to enhance the system robustness and control performance in the presence of the camera parameter uncertainties;  it is very desired to develop vision-based control approaches without any offline or online camera calibration. In this article;  we propose a new calibration-free image-based trajectory tracking control scheme for nonholonomic mobile robots with a truly uncalibrated fixed camera. By developing a novel camera-parameter-independent kinematic model;  both offline and online camera calibration can be avoided in the proposed scheme;  and any knowledge of the camera is not needed in the controller design. The proposed trajectory tracking control scheme can guarantee exponential convergence of the image position and velocity tracking errors. To illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme;  experimental results are provided in this article.
