The printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) tends to become a bottleneck in an assembly line of electronic products. For improvement;  many assembly firms have introduced chip shooter machines. This;  however;  in turn;  raises the issue of how to best utilize these machines. To deal with the PCBA problems;  swarm intelligence (SI)-based metaheuristics have been increasingly popular due to the use of guided search that can better drive solutions toward optimality. In this study;  we have proposed a novel SI-based metaheuristics;  termed improved shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (I-SFLA2);  to deal with the feeder assignment problem (FAP);  and component sequencing problem (CSP) simultaneously for a chip shooter machine. With novel features such as self-adaptive jump;  push jump;  direct-jump prevention;  and self-adaptive variant;  the I-SFLA2 can develop smart jumps for frogs to approach and search around elites quickly while avoiding being trapped in local optima. The I-SFLA2 includes the strategy of transitioning from exploration to exploitation by decreasing the number of memeplexes iteratively. Our small-sized experiments showed the I-SFLA2 had a high hit rate to the optimal solution whereas big-sized experiments showed the I-SFLA2 outperformed the basic SFLA (B-SFLA);  B-SFLA(2);  the improved SFLA (I-SFLA1);  as well as the PSO2 proposed in previous studies. The computational times for the I-SFLA2 were found also reasonable for practical usage.
