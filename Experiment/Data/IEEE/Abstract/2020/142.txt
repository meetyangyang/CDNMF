This article addresses the combinatorial explosion problem for diagnosability analysis of discrete event systems (DESs) using bounded labeled Petri nets (LPNs). Some reduction rules are given to simplify a priori the LPN model before analyzing the diagnosability. When the conditions of these reduction rules are fulfilled;  some regular unobservable transitions and some specific observable transitions are suppressed. It is proven that these rules preserve the diagnosability property of the LPN system. By using reduction rules;  the memory cost for diagnosability analysis is reduced.
