Recently;  a rapid growth in the number of vehicles on the road has led to an unexpected surge of parking demand. Consequently;  finding a parking space has become increasingly difficult and expensive. One of the viable approaches is to utilize both public and private parking lots (PLs) to effectively share the parking spaces. However;  when the parking demands are not balanced among PLs;  a local congestion problem occurs where some PLs are overloaded;  and others are underutilized. Therefore;  in this article;  we formulate the parking assignment problem with two objectives: 1) minimizing parking expenses and 2) balancing parking demand among multiple PLs. First;  we derive a matching solution for minimizing parking expenses. Then;  we extend our study by considering both parking expenses and balancing parking demand;  formulating this as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. We solve that problem by using an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm that can enable a distributed implementation. Finally;  the simulation results show that the matching game approach outperforms the greedy approach by 8.5% in terms of parking utilization;  whereas the ADMM-based algorithm produces performance gains up to 27.5% compared with the centralized matching game approach. Furthermore;  the ADMM-based proposed algorithm can obtain a near-optimal solution with a fast convergence that does not exceed eight iterations for the network size with 1000 vehicles.
