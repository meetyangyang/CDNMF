Due to the rapid development of sensing technologies;  multiple sensors became available for real-time monitoring of the degradation status of machine systems. With such a wealth of data collected from multiple sensors;  researchers have proposed different sensor fusion approaches for prognosis and condition monitoring;  thus allowing accurate inference of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machine systems. However;  almost no method provides a statistical metric to evaluate the quality of degradation signals for prognosis and condition monitoring. To fill this literature gap;  this paper develops a sensor fusion framework to check the reliability of given degradation signals for prognosis and degradation analysis through a series of statistical hypothesis tests. A health index is constructed in the sensor fusion framework to help differentiate between distinct degradation states. Based on the health index;  the remaining times to various degradation states are estimated;  including the RUL to failure. A published degradation data set of aircraft engines is used to evaluate and compare the prognostic and condition monitoring performance of the proposed method with benchmark methods.
