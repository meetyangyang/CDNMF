With regard to virtual reality (VR) simulators;  direct guidance is needed due to the complex procedures and safety of customers compared with simple coin-op amusement games. However;  it is difficult for human attendants to repeatedly guide the customer with a high level of service quality. In this article;  we propose a new type of robotic attendant for VR simulators;  which provides personalized high-quality services and automatically operates the VR simulators in VR theme parks. In addition;  the robotic attendant improves customer satisfaction by providing personalized services based on the estimation of the customer's age;  gender;  and game progress. Finally;  we experimentally show that the personalized services provided by the robotic attendant improve customer satisfaction. The results of the satisfaction questionnaire and independent-samples t-test validate our proposed scheme.
