The energy-intensive enterprises (EIEs);  such as iron and steel enterprises;  account for a significant part of the total energy consumption in society. The Linz-Donawitz converter gas (LDG) is a kind of crucial byproduct energy resource recycled during the steelmaking process;  and its reasonable scheduling can effectively reduce the LDG emission and increase its efficiency. In this study;  a granular-causality-based scheduling approach for the LDG system in steel industry is proposed. A granular causality technique is modeled to confirm the casual relationship of the LDG system based on the discontinuous production characteristic;  in which a causality diagram is established and the phase space of the training sample is reconstructed to improve the prediction accuracy. Then;  a multioutput least-square support vector machine model is constructed for the prediction of the gas tank levels. In order to consider the impact of multiple solutions on the scheduling result in a period of time;  a scheduling objective function that combines the economy criterion and the safety one is designed and optimized by a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The validation experiments using real-world data coming from the energy data center of a steel plant are carried out;  and the results indicate that the proposed method exhibits reliable performance. Moreover;  an application software system based on the proposed method is developed and implemented;  which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach.
