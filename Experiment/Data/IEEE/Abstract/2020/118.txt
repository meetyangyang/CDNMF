In this paper;  a multi-level simultaneous minimization (MLSM) scheme is proposed and investigated to remedy the joint-angle drift (JAD) and non-zero final joint-velocity (NZFJV) phenomena as well as to prevent the occurrence of high joint variables of redundant robot manipulators. The proposed scheme is novelly designed within multiple levels and finally resolved at the jerk level for a jerk-bounded robot motion;  which is desirable for engineering applications. More importantly;  the correctness of the proposed MLSM scheme is guaranteed by the corresponding theorems. Then;  the MLSM scheme is formulated as a dynamical quadratic program (DQP) that is solved by a piecewise linear projection equation neural network (PLPENN). Furthermore;  the path-tracking simulations based on a 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator substantiate the effectiveness and advantage of the MLSM scheme. Comparisons between the MLSM scheme and the minimum jerk norm (MJN) scheme illustrate that the proposed scheme is superior and more applicable. Finally;  the additional validation on the KUKA robot in the virtual robot experimentation platform (V-REP) is provided for reproducible engineering applications by researchers and practitioners. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
