Because that the light-energy consumption (LC) is growing quite dramatically over the past decades;  the light-energy efficiency is regarded as a key component of the modern energy system in major cities. In this paper;  a novel and sophisticated algorism of lighting control is presented to improve light-energy efficiency and cut down energy consumption;  when considering the lighting system with multilighting equipment. In this paper;  a multivariate extremum seeking controller is used to manipulate;  respectively;  the luminance of multilighting equipment;  in order to track the minimal LC efficiently. Meanwhile;  a proportional- integral-differential (PID) approach is adopted to achieve the required level of illumination. The proposed extremum seeking control (ESC) is designed to ensure the amplitude of the dither signal converge exponentially to zero;  by making the amplitudes change with the extremum estimation error. The presented frame helps to improve search speed for the minimal LC value and remove the steady-state oscillations. The comparative experiments reveal that;  compared with the convergence velocity of the Newtonand gradient-based ESCs;  the developed method for the track of the minimal LC can have higher accuracy and faster speed.
