This article studies the optimal allocation of inpatient rooms for multiple types of patients in public hospitals and the patient scheduling problem with planned acceptance ratios (ARs). For public hospitals;  it is important to allocate limited resources to multiple types of patients and manage patient access for maximizing hospital revenue and upholding service equity. The problem is formulated as two-stage models. Considering uncertainties in patients' arrival and length of stay;  we first propose a nonlinear stochastic programming (NSP) model for inpatient room allocation with the objective of maximizing revenue under the constraints of maintaining equity. To solve this problem;  we transform the complex NSP model into a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model;  which is solved by CPLEX;  by reformulating the chance constraints as knapsack constraints based on a linearization technique and a simulation model. Given the allocated capacity and planned AR;  we further propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program combined with a goal program model to optimize patient scheduling. To solve the model;  a Benders decomposition based on the sample average approximation approach is proposed. The real data-based experimental results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our models and approaches. The impacts of some parameters on the objective and decisions are also explored. A simulation procedure is developed to compare the performances of different patient scheduling methods;  from which the results show that our proposed approach outperforms a benchmark policy.
