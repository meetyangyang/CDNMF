This article proposes a novel methodology for multistage;  multiproduct;  multi-item;  and closed-loop Supply Chain Network (SCN) design under uncertainty. The method considers that multiple products are manufactured by the SCN;  each composed by multiple items;  and that some of the sold products may require repair;  refurbishing;  or remanufacturing activities. We solve the two main decisions that take place in the medium-/short-term planning horizon;  namely partners' selection and allocation of the received orders among them. The partners' selection problem is solved by a cross-efficiency fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis technique;  which allows evaluating the efficiency of each SCN member and ranking them against multiple conflicting objectives under uncertain data on their performance. Then;  according to the estimated customers' demand;  the order allocation problem is solved by a fuzzy bargaining game problem;  where each SCN actor behaves to simultaneously maximize both its own profit and the service level of the overall SCN in terms of efficiency;  costs;  and lead time. An illustrative example from the literature is finally presented.
