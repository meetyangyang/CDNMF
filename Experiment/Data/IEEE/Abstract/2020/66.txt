As parallel computing becomes increasingly important in many real-world applications;  a batch sequential experimental design (BSED);  which adds a batch of computer experiments per iteration and runs these simulations in parallel;  is gaining popularity in surrogate modeling. This article proposes sequential online dispatch in design of experiments (SODDE) for single- and multiple-response surrogate modeling when multiple processors work in parallel but not independently. The proposed method includes several unique features: 1) it works with any popular acquisition function to select a single new sample point at each iteration; 2) it minimizes the idle time of all processors; 3) it rapidly updates the surrogate model; and 4) it dynamically reconstructs the surrogate model when a simulation process aborts;  minimizing the impact incurred by the abortion. The effectiveness of SODDE is evaluated in one mathematical example and one industrial problem. The latter problem considers blade design of horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs). The cost of finding blade geometry that results in the desired aerodynamic behavior of HAWTs is estimated for BSED and SODDE. Relative to BSED;  SODDE reduces the costs by up to approximately 31%.
