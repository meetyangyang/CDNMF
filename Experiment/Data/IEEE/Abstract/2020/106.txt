In this paper;  we propose SCALAR;  a calibration method to simultaneously calibrate the kinematic parameters of a 6-DoF robot and the extrinsic parameters of a 2-D laser range finder (LRF) attached to the robot's flange. The calibration setup requires only a flat plate with two small holes carved on it at a known distance from each other and a sharp tool-tip attached to the robot's flange. The calibration is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem where the laser and the tool-tip are used to provide the planar and distance constraints;  and the optimization problem is solved using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We demonstrate through experiments that SCALAR can reduce the mean and the maximum tool position error from 0.44 to 0.19 mm and from 1.41 to 0.50 mm;  respectively.
