Going “energy efficient” has been one of the missions for manufacturers to stay globally competitive. Considering machining as a major manufacturing activity;  how to effectively model and control its energy consumption becomes critical. Although researchers have analyzed the energy consumption of machining from the machine;  process planning;  or shop-floor perspective individually;  very litter work has comprehensively studied the concurrent interactions among energy-aware decisions for machine parameter settings;  process planning;  and shop-floor control. Hence;  the work presented in this article undertakes this challenge in the context of a resource-constrained machining system. In particular;  the energy characteristics of machining are first analyzed with the consideration of various machine tools;  cutting tools;  cutting parameters;  operation sequences;  as well as machine availability. A multiobjective optimization model is then developed to minimize both energy consumption and makespan. The solution is provided through honey bee mating optimization algorithm (HBMOA) combined with shop-floor simulation. In addition;  the significance of the proposed approach is exemplified and elucidated by a case study.
