In this article;  a novel real-time acceleration-continuous path-constrained trajectory planning algorithm is proposed with an appealing built-in tradeoff mechanism between the cruise motion and time-optimal motion. Different from existing approaches;  the proposed approach smoothens time-optimal trajectories with bang-bang input structures to generate acceleration-continuous trajectories while preserving the completeness property. More importantly;  a novel built-in tradeoff mechanism is proposed and embedded into the trajectory planning framework so that the proportion of the cruise motion and time-optimal motion can be flexibly adjusted by changing a user-specified functional parameter. Thus;  the user can easily apply the trajectory planning algorithm for various tasks with different requirements on motion efficiency and cruise proportion. Moreover;  it is shown that feasible trajectories are computed more quickly than optimal trajectories. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are presented for those aforementioned theoretical results. Comparative simulations and experimental results on an omnidirectional wheeled mobile robot demonstrate that flexible tunings between the cruise and time-optimal motions can be achieved in a higher computational efficiency manner by the proposed algorithm.
