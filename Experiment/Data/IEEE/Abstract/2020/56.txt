Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the manufacturing domain can be deployed to support monitoring and analysis of production systems of a factory in order to improve;  support;  or automate processes;  such as maintenance or scheduling. When a network of CPS is subject to frequent changes;  the semantic interoperability between the CPSs is of special interest in order to avoid manual;  tedious;  and error-prone information model alignments at runtime. Ontologies are a suitable technology to enable semantic interoperability;  as they allow the building of information models that lank machine-readable meaning to information;  thus enabling CPSs to mutually understand the shared information. The contribution of this article is twofold. First;  we present an ontology building method that is tailored toward the needs of CPSs in the manufacturing domain. For this purpose;  we introduce the requirements regarding this method and discuss related research concerning ontology building. The method itself is designed to begin with ontological requirements and to yield a formal ontology. As the reuse of ontologies and other information resources (IRs) is crucial to the success of ontology building projects;  we put special emphasis on how to reuse IRs in the CPS domain. Second;  we present a reusable set of ontology design patterns that have been developed with the aforementioned method in an industrial use case and illustrate their application in the considered industrial environment. The contribution of this article extends the method introduced;  as a postconference paper;  by a detailed industrial application.
