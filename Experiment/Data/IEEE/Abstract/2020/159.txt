Fruit detection is a fundamental task for automatic yield estimation. The goal is to detect all the fruits in images. The-state of the art of fruit detection algorithm;  Faster R-CNN;  shows a lack of detection advantage on small fruits. One of the reasons is only that single-level features and a classifier are used for localization of proposal candidates. In this article;  we propose to incorporate a multiple classifier fusion strategy into a Faster R-CNN network for small fruit detection. We utilize features from three different levels to learn three classifiers for objectness classification in the stage of proposal localization. Probabilities from classifiers are combined by a simple convolutional layer to generate final objectness classification for proposal candidates. During training;  in order to train a model with strong generalization capability;  we propose to use correlation coefficients to measure the diversity of multiple classifiers. A novel loss function with classifier correlation is introduced to train the region proposal network. We evaluate the proposed model on two data sets of small fruits. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors for fruit detection.
