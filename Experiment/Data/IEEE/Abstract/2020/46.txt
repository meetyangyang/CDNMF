We investigate an energy-efficient elevating transfer vehicle routing problem (ETVRP);  in which an elevating transfer vehicle (ETV) serves a multi-level freight handling system to transport cargo containers between airside and landside in an air cargo terminal. The problem can be regarded as a special case of stacker crane problem defined on a regular grid graph constructed by uniform rectangular tiles. Even with the special grid network structure;  the ETVRP is still NP-hard in general. We manage to identify a subset of the ETVRP instances that are polynomially solvable based on the condition of free-permutation. For general ETVRPs;  we propose a new and more efficient exact formulation whose dimensionality does not constantly increase with the number of requests and is bounded by the size of the underlying grid network. To further enhance computational efficiency;  we develop two approximation algorithms;  one of which is asymptotically optimal and has the time-complexity that grows linearly with the number of requests; the other has a bounded time-complexity and works better for instances with smaller arc lengths. Combining these two algorithms can guarantee an approximation ratio of 5/3. The performances of the proposed formulation and the approximation algorithms are further examined through numerical simulations.
