An isolated power system (IPS) usually operates in an islanded mode. Because of the lack of support from an external power grid;  stability is a prominent issue for IPSs. This article proposes a novel stability analysis approach for IPSs based on the input-to-state stability (ISS) theory. Compared with existing stability analyses that use simulations and direct methods;  the proposed method decomposes the stability analysis process by considering the ISS properties of subsystems and a network equation that reflects their connections. Thus;  it has good adaptability for the stability analysis of systems with flexible operating conditions. Algorithms are presented for estimating the ISS properties of subsystems;  and asymptotic gains in a piecewise linear form are adopted. The small gain theorem is used for the decomposed stability analysis;  and a practical algorithm to numerically check the small gain condition is presented. Time-domain simulations were performed with a test system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition-based stability analysis approach. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
