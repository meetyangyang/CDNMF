Under the consideration of massive energy consumption of machine tools;  many approaches have been proposed;  and state control method of machine tools has proved its effectiveness. In order to satisfy the demand of real-time production control;  a deep learning methodology for energy-efficient control of CNC machine tools is proposed in RFID-enabled ubiquitous environment. First;  the energy-efficient control strategies for multiple machine tools are proposed to reduce the carbon emission of the machining process. Then;  through evaluating the process progress in the RFID-enabled environment;  a deep learning methodology for energy-efficient strategies selection of CNC machine tools using deep belief networks (DBNs) is established to realize the real-time and accurate control of machine tools. Finally;  comparisons between the proposed approach and some state-of-the-art ones are given;  and the experiment results indicate that the proposed method is effective and efficient for the energy-efficient control problem of machine tools. The proposed method can realize the real-time control of CNC machine tools based on the interaction information in Industrial 4.0. Furthermore;  the machine tools will be converted to smart machines;  which can complete self-perception and self-adjustment automatically.
