To deal with the multimodality;  nonlinearity;  and nonconvexity of the maximum likelihood (ML) cost function when solving the localization problem with received signal strength (RSS) in wireless sensor networks;  we propose a localization approach based on the differential evolution algorithm;  opposition-based learning;  and adaptive redirection in a unified way. In the proposed approach;  we need neither to approximate the ML cost function nor to provide a good initial point while most conventional approaches;  including those based on the semidefinite programming;  second-order cone programming;  and unscented transformation. The performance and computational complexity of the proposed approach are analyzed and compared with those of other approaches for three practical scenarios. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach performs better than other approaches with relatively low computational complexity.
