Complex logistics support missions require the execution of spatially separated information gathering and situational awareness tasks. Mobile robot teams can play an important role in the automated execution of these tasks to reduce mission completion time. Planning strategies for such missions must take into account the formation of effective coalitions among available robots and assignment of tasks to robots with the goal of minimizing the expected mission completion time. The occurrence of unexpected situations that adversely interfere with the execution of the mission may require the execution of contingency tasks so that the originally planned tasks may proceed with minimal disruption. Initially reported potential contingency tasks may not always affect mission tasks due to the uncertainty in the mission environment. When potential contingency tasks are reported;  the planner updates its existing plan to minimize the expected mission completion time based on the probability of these contingency tasks impacting the mission;  their impact on the mission;  and other task characteristics. We describe various heuristic-based strategies to compute task allocations for robots for mission execution. We perform simulation experiments to compare them and analyze the computational performance of the best performing strategy. We show that the proactive approach to contingency task management outperforms both the conservative and reactive approaches.
