The steelmaking process in the iron and steel industry involves complicated physicochemical reactions. The main aim of steelmaking is to adjust the quality of molten steel. During the steel-tapping process;  the temperature and carbon content are the most essential quality indices for end-point prediction. This article presents a novel machine learning framework for the endpoint prediction problems in the smelting process. Considering the importance of data representation in modeling;  the original data are inputted to a stacked autoencoder (SAE) to extract the essential features in an unsupervised manner. The top layer is then designed as a sparse Bayesian regression (SBR) layer to obtain the predicted mean values and error bars that measure the uncertainty in the prediction. To improve the generalization ability of the prediction model;  an intelligent optimization algorithm based on improved differential evolution (DE) is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. The main advantage of this model is that the underlying characteristics of the samples can be learned automatically layer by layer;  instead of designing them manually. Finally;  the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real data collected from two steel plants. The experimental results show that the proposed model gives a more precise prediction than other existing models and can provide error bars for the end-point prediction.
