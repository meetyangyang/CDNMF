In this article;  an admittance-based controller for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is presented to perform the coordinated operation in the constrained task space. An admittance model and a soft saturation function are employed to generate a differentiable reference trajectory to ensure that the end-effector motion of the manipulator complies with the human operation and avoids collision with surroundings. Then;  an adaptive neural network (NN) controller involving integral barrier Lyapunov function (IBLF) is designed to deal with tracking issues. Meanwhile;  the controller can guarantee the end-effector of the manipulator limited in the constrained task space. A learning method based on the radial basis function NN (RBFNN) is involved in controller design to compensate for the dynamic uncertainties and improve tracking performance. The IBLF method is provided to prevent violations of the constrained task space. We prove that all states of the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) by utilizing the Lyapunov stability principles. At last;  the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified on a Baxter robot experiment platform.
