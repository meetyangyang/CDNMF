This article aims to improve deep-learning-based surface defect recognition. Owing to the insufficiency of the defect images in practical production lines and the high cost of labeling;  it is difficult to obtain a sufficient defect data set in terms of diversity and quantity. A new generation method called surface defect-generation adversarial network (SDGAN);  which employs generative adversarial networks (GANs);  is proposed to generate defect images using a large number of defect-free images from industrial sites. Experiments show that the defect images generated by the SDGAN have better image quality and diversity than those generated by the state-of-the-art methods. The SDGAN is applied to expand the commutator cylinder surface defect image data sets with and without labels (referred to as the CCSD-L and CCSD-NL data sets;  respectively). Regarding anomaly recognition;  a 1.77% error rate and a 49.43% relative improvement (IMP) for the CCSD-NL defect data set are obtained. Regarding defect classification;  a 0.74% error rate and a 57.47% IMP for the CCSD-L defect data set are achieved. Moreover;  defect classification trained on the images augmented by the SDGAN is robust to uneven and poor lighting conditions.
