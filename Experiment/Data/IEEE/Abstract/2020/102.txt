The efficient mitigation of the detrimental effects of a fault in complex systems requires online fault diagnosis techniques that are able to identify the cause of an observable anomaly. However;  an individual diagnosis model can only acquire a limited diagnostic effect and may be insufficient for a particular application. In this paper;  a Bayesian network-based probabilistic ensemble learning (PEL-BN) strategy is proposed to address the aforementioned issue. First;  an ensemble index is proposed to evaluate the candidate diagnosis models in a probabilistic manner so that the diagnosis models with better diagnosis performance can be selected. Then;  based on the selected classifiers;  the architecture of the Bayesian network can be constructed using the proposed three types of basic topologies. Finally;  the advantages of different diagnosis models are integrated using the developed Bayesian network;  and thus;  the fault causes of the observable anomaly can be accurately inferred. In addition;  the proposed method can effectively capture the mixed fault characteristics of multifaults (MFs) by integrating decisions derived from different diagnosis models. Hence;  this method can also provide a feasible solution for diagnosing MFs in real industrial processes. A simulation process and a real industrial process are adopted to verify the performance of the proposed method;  and the experimental results illustrate that the proposed PEL-BN strategy improves the diagnosis performance of single faults and is a feasible solution for MF diagnosis.
