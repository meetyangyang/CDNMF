This paper studies the torque applied by a large number of particles on a long aspect-ratio rod. The particles are all pushed in the same direction by a global signal. We calculate the force and torque generated by three canonical position distributions of a swarm: uniform;  triangular;  and normal. The model shows that for a pivoted rod the uniform distribution produces the maximum torque for small swarm standard deviations;  but the normal distribution maximizes torque for large standard deviations. In the simulation;  we use these results to design proportional-derivative controllers to orient rigid objects. We conclude showing the experiments with up to 97 hardware robots to evaluate our theory in practice.
