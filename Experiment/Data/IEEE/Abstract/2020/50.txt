This position article presents dispersed automation;  a novel approach for reprogramming the omnipresent industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices in critical infrastructure for the co-execution of general-purpose computation workloads in an optimal and reliable manner. The key observation is that IIoT devices are available in large quantities in critical infrastructure. However;  these devices are often underutilized due to the conservative allocation of resources;  static task assignment;  and lack of exploitation of parallelism. Dispersed automation gives new life to IIoT devices;  some of them as powerful as general-purpose computers;  and makes them accessible for the co-execution of various computational workloads;  while dynamically adapting to different applications and operational environments. Two key contributions make this possible: the use of a domain-specific language and on-channel computation. We present dispersed automation as an enabling technology for the implementation of future smart and adaptive IIoT systems.
