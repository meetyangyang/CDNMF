Learning the relationship between a response variable (e.g.;  a quality characteristic) and a set of predictors (e.g.;  process variables) is of special importance in process modeling;  prediction;  and optimization. In many applications;  not only is the number of these variables large but these variables are also high-dimensional (HD) (e.g.;  they are represented by waveform signals). This high dimensionality requires a systematic approach to both modeling the relationship between the variables and removing the noninformative input variables. This article proposes a functional regression method in which an HD response is estimated and predicted through a set of informative and noninformative HD covariates. For this purpose;  the functional regression coefficients are expanded through a set of low-dimensional smooth basis functions. In order to estimate the low-dimensional set of parameters;  a penalized loss function with both smoothing and group lasso penalties is defined. The block coordinate decent (BCD) method is employed to develop a computationally tractable algorithm for minimizing the loss function. Through simulations and case studies;  the performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with benchmarks. The results illustrate the advantage of the proposed method over the benchmarks.
