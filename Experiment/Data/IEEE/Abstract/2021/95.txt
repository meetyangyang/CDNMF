Ambient assisted living and smart home technologies are a good way to take care of dependent people whose number will increase in the future. They allow the discovery and the recognition of human's activities of daily living (ADLs) in order to take care of people by keeping them in their home. In order to consider the human behavior nondeterminism;  probabilistic approaches are used despite difficulties encountered in model generation and probabilistic indicators computing. In this article;  a global method based on probabilistic finite-state automata and the definition of the normalized likelihood and perplexity is proposed to manage ADLs discovery and recognition. In order to reduce the computational complexity;  some results about a simplified normalized likelihood computation are proved. A real case study showing the efficiency of the proposed method is discussed.
