High flexible and high precise manipulation is one of the most critical technique for complex microsystem's measurement;  manufacture;  and assembly. Although recent advances in microrobotics have successfully realized the automatic manipulation and positioning of tiny objects;  their flexible manipulation in 3-D free space remains a challenge;  such as the wide-angle rotation manipulation of microsize sphere;  due to the complicate surface forces. Herein;  this article proposed a feedforward model and realized the precise rotation for microsized sphere by two cooperative flexible micropipettes. Firstly;  a microrobotic manipulation system with six degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) was developed and integrated with the microscope. Then;  a feedforward compensation control strategy involving dual rotation was proposed for the precise manipulation of microsized sphere (~90 Î¼m) based on the analysis of contact forces. As a result;  the rotation of the microsized sphere in two different planes was realized and the microsized sphere release procedure was also accomplished after rotation. Compared with existing techniques only allowing limited amplitudes rotation;  this article realizes wide-angle rotation manipulation of microsized sphere in 3-D free space. This research opens new prospects for the microsized object accurate manipulation;  which is expected to give a long-term impact for complex microsystem's manufacture and assembly.
