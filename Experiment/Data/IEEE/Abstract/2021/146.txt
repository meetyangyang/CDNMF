The roll-to-roll (R2R) web printing system is a complex coupling system;  in which tension fluctuation is caused by upstream register control;  thus results in downstream register errors. Therefore;  it is indispensable to compensate for the couplings in order to improve the register precision in R2R printing systems. However;  existing control methods do not realize complete decoupling due to their indirect calculation of compensations for the register errors. In this article;  a mechanical model is set up to represent the direct relationship between the downstream register errors and all their upstream register controls. According to the model;  compensation is calculated on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theorem to converge the register errors to zero. Then;  a direct-decoupling closed-loop control method with first-order compensation terms;  i.e.;  the direct-decoupling proportional derivative control (DDPD);  is proposed to completely compensate for the couplings between all upstream register controls and downstream register errors. In addition;  the first-order expression of the compensation makes it easy to implement in industrial applications. An industrial example indicates that the proposed control method eliminates the couplings and maintains the range of register errors within Â±0.06 mm. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
