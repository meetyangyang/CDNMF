Bin packing and bin covering are important optimization problems in many industrial fields;  such as packaging;  recycling;  and food processing. The problem concerns a set of items;  each with its own value;  that are to be sorted into bins in such a way that the total value of each bin;  as measured by the sum of its item values;  is not above (for packing) or below (for covering) a given target value. The optimization problem concerns minimizing;  for bin packing;  or maximizing;  for bin covering;  the number of bins. This is a combinatorial NP-hard problem;  for which true optimal solutions can only be calculated in specific cases;  such as when restricted to a small number of items. To get around this problem;  many suboptimal approaches exist. This article describes the formulations of the bin packing and covering problems that allow finding the true optimum;  for instance;  counting hundreds of items using general-purpose MILP-solvers. Also presented are suboptimal solutions that come within less than 10% of the optimum while taking significantly less time to calculate;  even ten to 100 times faster;  depending on the required accuracy.
