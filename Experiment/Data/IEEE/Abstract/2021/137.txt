Social robots are coming to our homes and have already been used to help humans in a number of ways in geriatric care. This article aims to develop a framework that enables social robots to conduct regular clinical screening interviews in geriatric care;  such as cognitive evaluation;  fallsâ€™ risk evaluation;  and pain rating. We develop a social robot with essential features to enable clinical screening interviews;  including a conversational interface;  face tracking;  an interaction handler;  attention management;  robot skills;  and cloud service management. Besides;  a general clinical screening interview management (GCSIM) model is proposed and implemented. The GCSIM enables social robots to handle various types of clinical questions and answers;  evaluate and score responses;  engage interviewees during conversations;  and generate reports on their well-being. These reports can be used to evaluate the progression of cognitive impairment;  risk of falls;  pain level;  and so on by caregivers or physicians. Such a clinical screening capability allows for early detection and treatment planning in geriatric care. The framework was developed and implemented on our 3-D-printed social robot. It was tested on 30 older adults with different ages;  achieved satisfying results;  and received their high confidence and trust in the use of this robot for human well-being assessment. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
