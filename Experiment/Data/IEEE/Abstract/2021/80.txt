The properties of a learning-based system are particularly relevant to the process study of the unknown behavior of a system or environment. In the semiconductor industry;  there is regularly a partially observable system in which the entire state of the process is not directly or fully visible due to uncertainties or disturbances. The model for studying such a system that permits uncertainties regarding the stochastic (Markov) process for state information acquisition is called a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This study aims to deal with the optimization issue of compensation control bias of a dynamic multilayer lithography process in wafer fabrication with prior information;  the existence of high-dimensionality;  and unmeasurable uncertainties. We show how the POMDP on a linear state-space model with uncertainties can encode the information from past runs and layers;  and deal with accumulated overlay error at the current run and layer. The Gibbs sampling is applied to optimize the belief function of POMDP optimization approach. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
