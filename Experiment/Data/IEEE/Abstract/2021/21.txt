Large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) has a similar mechanism to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) and is capable of fabricating a part in large size. This capability provides LSAM with potentials in a variety of industries;  including aerospace and automotive manufacturing. Product quality and production efficiency are two main concerns;  as LSAM is implemented. It has been proven that print surface temperature is a major factor that impacts the quality of final products. Therefore;  it needs to be controlled throughout the process. As an infrared camera is implemented;  the real-time data of surface temperature of parts are available. A dynamic approach is studied in this article to perform real-time layer time control based on the real-time data from the infrared camera to improve both product quality and production efficiency. A regression model is formulated and proved to fit the cooling dynamics. To deal with the layerwise change of cooling dynamics;  due to humidity and airflow;  the Gaussian process is used to keep the regression model updated. The regression model together with the Gaussian process can predict the surface temperature of a part accurately;  even in a dynamic environment. This method to predict surface temperature is then combined into an optimization model for real-time layer time control. Specifically;  more than one position on the surface is monitored and considered in the optimization model;  and the resulting layer time for each layer by solving the optimization model has the quality requirement satisfied and improves production efficiency. The improved system performance is presented in a case study. This article provides practitioners of LSAM with a useful tool to improve the process through manufacturing automation.
