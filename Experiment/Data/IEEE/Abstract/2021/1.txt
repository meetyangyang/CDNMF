Energy-efficient machining has become imperative for energy conservation;  emission reduction;  and cost saving of manufacturing sectors. Optimal machining parameter decision is regarded as an effective way to achieve energy efficient turning. For flexible machining;  it is of utmost importance to determine the optimal parameters adaptive to various machines;  workpieces;  and tools. However;  very little research has focused on this issue. Hence;  this paper undertakes this challenge by integrated meta-reinforcement learning (MRL) of machining parameters to explore the commonalities of optimization models and use the knowledge to respond quickly to new machining tasks. Specifically;  the optimization problem is first formulated as a finite Markov decision process (MDP). Then;  the continuous parametric optimization is approached with actor-critic (AC) framework. On the basis of the framework;  meta-policy training is performed to improve the generalization capacity of the optimizer. The significance of the proposed method is exemplified and elucidated by a case study with a comparative analysis.
