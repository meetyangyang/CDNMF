In the reverse Stackelberg mechanism;  by considering a decision function for the leader rather than a decision value in the conventional Stackelberg game;  the leader can explore a wider decision space. This flexibility can result in realizing the globally optimal solution of the leader's objective function;  while controlling the reaction function of the followers;  simultaneously. We consider an aggregator who purchases energy from the wholesale energy market. The aggregator acts as the leader for a group of plugged in electric vehicles (PEVs) and determines the price of energy versus consumption at each hour a day as its decision function. In the followers level;  since the optimal charging strategies of the PEVs are coupled through the electricity price;  the PEVs in a group are considered to cooperate in finding their Nash-Pareto-optimal charging strategy;  by minimizing a social cost function. For a large number of PEVs;  the cooperative cost minimization of PEVs can be modeled as a cooperative mean-field (MF) game. We propose a decentralized MF optimal control algorithm and prove that the algorithm converges to leader-follower MF ÎµN-Nash equilibrium point of the game. Furthermore;  a decentralized reverse Stackelberg algorithm is implemented to achieve the optimal linear price function of the leader. Simulation results and comparison with benchmark methods are performed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.
