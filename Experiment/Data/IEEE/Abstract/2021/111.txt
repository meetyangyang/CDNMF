Energy submetering at the equipment level provides a tool to identify energy use anomalies and detect operational inefficiencies. While physical meters can be costly and difficult to install;  virtual meters (VMs) overcome practical issues associated with physical meters and provide insights into critical unmeasured quantities. This article introduces an inverse greybox model-based virtual metering method to estimate the energy in an air handling unit (AHU). Models that represent the components typically found in AHUs are formulated using a data set from a highly instrumented AHU and combined into an integrated greybox model. The use of the integrated model to create VMs is demonstrated by using a data set from an independent AHU located in a large office building in Ottawa;  ON;  Canada. Model parameters are estimated by using the genetic algorithm and used in creating VMs that can estimate the heat supplied/extracted at the AHU level. In addition;  the model is used to estimate a monthly average outdoor air fraction used by the AHU. The potential of the component models and VMs to detect operational inefficiencies and support operational decisions is demonstrated through illustrative examples.
