The novel paradigm of collaborative automation;  with machines and industrial robots that synergically share the same workspace with human workers;  requires to rethink how activities are prioritized in order to account for possible variabilities in their durations. This article proposes a scheduling method for collaborative assembly tasks that allows to optimally plan assembly activities based on the knowledge acquired during runtime and so adapts to variations along the life cycle of a manufacturing process. The scheduler is based on time Petri nets and the output plan is optimized by minimizing the idle time of each agent. The experimental validation carried out on a realistic industrial use-case consisting of a small assembly line with two robots and a human operator confirms the effectiveness of the approach.
