Fault prognosis of the air-handling systems;  which are the key subsystems of heating;  ventilation;  and air conditioning systems;  allows system operators to know the remaining useful life (RUL);  thus preventing unexpected breakdowns and reducing the operational and maintenance costs. In this article;  a new hidden semi-Markov model-based method is developed. In the method;  only relevant state-transition points are selected and estimated;  leading to computational efficiency. Physics-based models are used in a novel way to provide “mapping matrices” relating component capacities to fault severities;  capturing impacts of multiple failure modes. Experimental results show that our method can effectively estimate the RUL of the components and the systems.
