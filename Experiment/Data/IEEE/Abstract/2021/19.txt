An improved method for solving conflict-free scheduling and routing of automated guided vehicles is proposed in this article;  with promising results. This is achieved by reformulating the mathematical model of the problem;  including several improvements and speedup strategies of an existing Benders decomposition method. A new heuristic is also presented that quickly yields high-quality solutions. Moreover;  a real-large-scale industrial instance is solved using an open-source satisfiability module theories solver and a commercial constraint programming solver. According to the results;  both of these general-purpose solvers can effectively solve the proposed models.
