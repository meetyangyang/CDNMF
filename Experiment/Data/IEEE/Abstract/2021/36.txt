Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of blindness. It is of great significance to apply deep-learning techniques for DR recognition. However;  deep-learning algorithms often depend on large amounts of labeled data;  which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain in the medical imaging area. In addition;  the DR features are inconspicuous and spread out over high-resolution fundus images. Therefore;  it is a big challenge to learn the distribution of such DR features. This article proposes a multichannel-based generative adversarial network (MGAN) with semisupervision to grade DR. The multichannel generative model is developed to generate a series of subfundus images corresponding to the scattering DR features. By minimizing the dependence on labeled data;  the proposed semisupervised MGAN can identify the inconspicuous lesion features by using high-resolution fundus images without compression. Experimental results on the public Messidor data set show that the proposed model can grade DR effectively.
