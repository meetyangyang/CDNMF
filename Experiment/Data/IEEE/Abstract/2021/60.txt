In a steel industry;  a slab yard plays a role of a buffer between continuous casting stage and rolling mill. An effective assignment and scheduling of cranes can guarantee the operation efficiency in the slab yard. This work studies a multicrane scheduling problem with noncrossing constraints of slabs. A mixed-integer programming model is used to formulate the problem that minimizes the whole traveling distance of all the cranes and ensures the workload balance among cranes. As it is an NP-hard problem;  classical programming mathematical methods are difficult to get an optimal solution for large-size instances. Thus;  we develop a branch and price algorithm to solve this problem. First;  we formulate the model as a generalized set covering problem and a set partition problem. Then;  we solve them and combine the solutions to obtain the solution of the original problem. Finally;  we conduct computational experiments based on real data from an ironâ€“steel plant. The comparisons of proposed methods with an exact solution method show its effectiveness. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
