Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT);  which is an important procedure in cloning;  has been conducted manually for decades. The operating efficiency drops sharply in batch SCNT because of the long-time observation under microscopy and the time-wasting traditional process. Though the operating time was reduced by robotic SCNT in previous studies;  the traditional operating process was still used. In this article;  we designed a new robotic batch SCNT process based on a microfluidic groove and two micropipettes in parallel. By using this new SCNT process;  the operating area switching;  objective lens conversing;  and focusing on traditional SCNT process were eliminated;  and oocyte localization was simplified;  which saved much operating time. Experimental results showed that the new robotic batch process reduced about 50 s (41.7%) compared with the manual process (proposed 70 s versus manual 120 s). A success rate of 93.3% (n = 30) and a survival rate of 96.4% were achieved (n = 28);  which were similar to manual process. The new robotic batch SCNT method demonstrated a high degree of efficiency and reproducibility.
