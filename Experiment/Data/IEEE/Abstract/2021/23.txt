People who suffer from paraplegia completely lose sensory and locomotor functions; there are no known treatment methods for their recovery at this time. Exoskeleton robots have the potential to dramatically improve the locomotor ability of these individuals. Although some exoskeleton robots for paraplegic patients have been commercialized and are able to restore walking motion at present;  the pilot must acquire the ability to maintain their balance and shift their weight using forearm crutches;  which is very challenging for paraplegics. To make this easier;  we propose a new automated intelligent gait planning method that integrates a finite-state machine (FSM) model as an underlying foundation and a gait generation model in addition to the exoskeleton system. The underlying FSM model is defined using an inverted pendulum model and a minimum jerk algorithm. To compare the planning gait;  33 volunteers provide normal walking gaits; there are two more volunteers (paraplegic and nonparaplegic) wearing the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) exoskeleton robot to validate the effects of the proposed gait and offer the groups of surface electromyogram (sEMG) data for analysis. As a result;  the input of the proposed gait planning method is simplified to two parameters. The proposed walking gait significantly reduces the arm muscle output.
