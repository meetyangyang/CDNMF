Compliant;  nonrigid parts are widely used in many industries today. Existing variation simulation analysis on the manufacturing part focuses on orientation and position deviation with part shape errors being largely omitted. This is a valid approach for the rigid part;  but it is unrealistic and can be problematic for the compliant part. In this study;  a new methodology has been introduced to compliant assembly early phase design to generate various probable variated manufacturing parts that conform to predefined tolerance specification or meet the certain industrial requirement. The proposed method is based upon the novel idea of a parametric space envelope;  a purpose-designed variation tool constructed from parametric curves. Variation of embedded manufacturing part is linked to and controlled by a compact set of envelope’s boundary control points. Part variation instances are generated by simulating the control points’ movement in a systematic and efficient way. Importantly;  simulated variations can be visualized in 3-D virtual space to provide user insight into part variation. The proposed methodology can help identify assembly high-risk regions;  select proper fixtures;  guide assembly engineering changes;  and optimize assembly operations. An industrial case study on a deformable vehicle door hinge plate is presented to illustrate the methodology. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
