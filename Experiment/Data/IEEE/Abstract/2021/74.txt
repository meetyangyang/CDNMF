Process monitoring;  which is used to ensure the product quality in semiconductor manufacturing;  develops a control chart and alerts engineers whenever a control limit is exceeded. However;  a late alarm could generate defects or scraps;  and thus;  a prealarm is urgent to be developed. This study proposes an in-line predictive monitoring (ILPM) framework that uses process parameter monitoring (PPM) in the first phase and equipment parameter monitoring (EPM) in the second phase. PPM includes off-line training and in-line prediction;  where we collect the first half of time-series data and predict the second half for in-line quality control. To maintain robustness and accuracy;  the concept drift is used to update the ILPM model in real time; specifically;  the EPM detects the loss of prediction by cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart or detects the change of equipment parameters by Bayesian approach for developing retraining mechanism. An empirical study of a semiconductor manufacturer indicates that the proposed ILPM framework improved both the quality control and production capacity. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
