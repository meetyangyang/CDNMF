Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are widely used for industrial control of critical infrastructures;  such as power plants and manufacturing systems. There is abundant evidence of SCADA systems being subject to cyberattacks. With increasing interest in industrial digitization;  the cybersecurity of SCADA systems is poised to be even more important. Equipment faults and cyberattacks can manifest themselves in a similar fashion;  i.e.;  they can exhibit similar signatures. This article focuses on methods that are capable of distinguishing equipment faults from bona fide cyberattacks. Especially;  we consider a relatively sophisticated form of cyberattack known as the “replay attack” (RA). We derive mathematical formalisms that distinguish the RA from several classes of equipment faults and verify our methodology through an extensive numerical study. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
