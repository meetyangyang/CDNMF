Steering microswimmers toward 3-D autonomous manipulation tasks has received extensive attention. Our previous works have accomplished autonomously manipulating microswimmers in the 2-D space. This article aims to extend the 2-D autonomous manipulation to 3-D autonomous manipulation. Specifically;  this article addresses the problem of an autonomous system that consists of 3-D path planning and 3-D path following for magnetically driven helical microswimmers. The path-planning algorithm called optimal Bidirectional RRT* is formulated to explore the shortest route in the confined 3-D space. A proxy-based sliding mode control (PSMC) approach is developed to design stable controllers based on the error model in the Serretâ€“Frenet frame. We transport the swimming model trained by a kind of neural network to another new helical microswimmer according to an online updating scheme. The updating scheme can identify and refine compensating angles between the swimming direction of the microswimmer and the magnetic direction in the 3-D space facing the weight disturbances of the swimmer and lateral disturbances. The experiments are conducted to quantitatively validate the 3-D autonomous manipulation system. Experimental results show the effectiveness of path planning and path following with submillimeter accuracy in a 3-D space. Future works will focus on autonomous manipulations in dynamic environments. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
