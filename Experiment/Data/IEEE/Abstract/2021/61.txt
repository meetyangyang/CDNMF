Performing a successful robotic grasping to uncertain objects in unstructured environments is challenging. This study presents a new compliant soft robotic gripper for objects handling and cap manipulation through the coordination of three soft fingers and in-hand manipulation. The experiments are conducted to validate that the soft robotic gripper can successfully realize simultaneous grasping and capping manipulations with only one flexible shaft actuation for every single soft finger. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
