This article addresses a real-world tactical production planning problem in which a series of real-world constraints need to be considered;  such as no backorder;  products with multilevel bills of material (BOMs);  and lot streaming production. Under the premise of no backorder;  the objective of this plan is to make the workload as balanced as possible throughout the planning horizon. An integer quadratic programming model is first proposed to formulate this problem. Then;  based on the analysis of the optimal solution for a common BOM structure;  this problem is reformulated to a simplified problem where only one item in BOM needs to be considered. Some optimality properties are further derived to help solve this problem. An enhanced variable neighborhood search algorithm is developed to solve this problem;  and a lower bound is put forward to measure the performance of the algorithm. Experimental results show that this algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions in a short time.
