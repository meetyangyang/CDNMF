E-consults offer a digital platform where primary care physicians (PCPs) can consult specialists and obtain feedback or offer a direct specialty referral to their patients. The goal of this work is to investigate whether e-consults can advance the primary-specialty care interface and reduce referral delays. We provide a high-level abstraction of e-consult operations using an analytical framework that quantifies the benefit of e-consults in the context of efficient matching in a flexible service system. With heterogeneous patients who lack information regarding the severity of their condition;  e-consults are conceptualized as Bayesian learning to estimate the true severity;  parameterized by the level of e-consult efficacy;  a measure of the degree of PCPs and specialists' communication and information sharing efforts. The analytical framework of games with incomplete information combines the Hotelling model;  the Bayesian inference;  and service science to fully capture the patient flow dynamics between the PCP and the specialist modulated by the revelation of hidden patient severity information enabled by e-consults. The fundamental e-consult economics is related to strategic patients who are oversensitive toward the service prices and congestion costs;  which leads to the overuse of one type of service. Such a behavior can be mitigated by e-consults that facilitate shared diagnostic efforts that can navigate patients away from the more popular choice toward a more suitable one.
