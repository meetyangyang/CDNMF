This article deals with improved formal verification of reconfigurable discrete-event systems (DESs) modeled by reconfigurable timed net condition event systems (R-TNCESs). An R-TNCES consists of a set of timed net condition event systems;  each of which represents a particular behavior of a DES;  and a reconfiguration scenario is a switching mode from a timed net condition event system to another. However;  the verification with the classical computation tree logic (CTL) as well as the related extensions increases the number of properties for complete verification of a complex R-TNCES. We propose reconfigurable CTL as a new extension of CTL to reduce such a number. New connectors of reconfigurable CTL are proposed;  with their formal syntax and semantics;  and a set of new algorithms is proposed to control the complexity of model checking. We use a benchmark production system for the performance evaluation of the proposed approach. Reduction in the number of properties to be checked is shown;  and consequently;  the related validation time is reduced. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
