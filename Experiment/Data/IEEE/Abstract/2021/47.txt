Consider a sensor that reports whether or not an event has occurred \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>somewhere</i>\n along a path;  but that has no conception of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>where</i>\n along the path that event has occurred. We name this type of sensor a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>path-based sensor</i>\n and describe the recursive Bayesian update that can be used to calculate posterior beliefs about the presence of a sensor triggering phenomenon given a path-based sensor observation. We show how the Bayesian update can be leveraged to calculate the expected Shannon information that will be gained along a particular path. We formalize two iterative information-gathering problems that result from this scenario and present path-planning algorithms to solve them. These include: 1) gathering information about the path-based sensor triggering phenomena and 2) assuming the path-based sensor triggering event is “robot destruction; ” simultaneously gather information about: 1) hazards using a path-based sensor and 2) information about another environmental phenomenon using a standard sensor;  such as the locations of search and rescue targets with a camera. We evaluate our methods using Monte Carlo simulations and observe that they outperform other techniques with respect to the new problems that we consider. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
