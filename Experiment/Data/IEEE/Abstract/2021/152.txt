Timed Petri nets (TPNs) have been widely used for modeling discrete-event systems of diverse manufacturing and service industries. In this article;  we introduce a reachability tree-based optimization algorithm to optimize cyclic schedules of TPNs. In particular;  we focus on a special class of cyclic schedules that are referred to as one-cyclic schedules;  i.e.;  the algorithm efficiently finds the optimal one-cyclic transition firing schedule of a TPN. The proposed scheduling method can be robustly applied and extended to a number of different scheduling models since the methodology is not bounded to a specific domain. To enhance the computational performance;  we establish a set of transition ordering constraints that can reduce the tree size during the search procedure. We evaluate the computational efficiency of the suggested algorithm by examining robotized manufacturing systems where one-cyclic schedules are popularly being used. It is numerically shown that the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient than the previously studied Petri net-based optimization methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
