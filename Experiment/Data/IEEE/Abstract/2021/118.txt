The idea of using wind power to charge electric vehicles (EVs) has attracted more and more attention nowadays due to the potential in significantly reducing air pollution. However;  this problem is challenging on account of the uncertainty in the wind power generation and the charging demand from the EVs. Simulation-based policy improvement (SBPI) has been an important method for decision-making in stochastic dynamic programming and;  in particular;  for charging decisions of EVs in microgrids. However;  the problem of allocating the limited computing budget for the best decision-making in online applications is less discussed. We consider this important problem in this work and make the following three major contributions. First;  we show that the significant uncertainty in wind power generation forecasting could make the policy that is the outcome of an SBPI worse than the base policy. Second;  we apply two existing methods to address this issue;  namely;  the optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) for maximizing the probability of correct selection (OCBA_PCS) and the OCBA for minimizing the expected opportunity cost (OCBA_EOC). The asymptotic optimality is briefly reviewed. Third;  we numerically compare the performance of OCBA_PCS and OCBA_EOC with the equal allocation (EA);  a principle-based method;  and a stochastic scenario-based method on small-scale and large-scale experiments. This work sheds light on the EV charging decision in general.
