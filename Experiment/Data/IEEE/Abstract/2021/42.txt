This article examines the selection of a robotâ€™s actuation and sensing hardware to minimize the cost of that design while ensuring that the robot is capable of carrying out a plan to complete a task. Its primary contribution is in the study of the hardness of reasonable formal models for that minimization problem. Specifically;  for the case in which sensing hardware is held fixed;  we show that this algorithmic design problem is NP-hard even for particularly simple classes of cost functions;  confirming what many perhaps have suspected about this sort of design-time optimization. We also introduce a formalism;  based on the notion of label maps;  for the broader problem in which the design space encompasses choices for both actuation and sensing components. As a result;  for several questions of interest;  having both optimality and efficiency of solution is unlikely. However;  we also show that;  for some specific types of cost functions;  the problem is either polynomial-time solvable or fixed-parameter tractable. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
