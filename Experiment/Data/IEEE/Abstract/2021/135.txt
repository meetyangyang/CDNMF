The problem of fault classification in industry has been studied extensively. Most classification algorithms are modeled on the premise of data balance. However;  the difficulty of collecting industrial data in different modes is quite different. This inevitably leads to data imbalance;  which will adversely affect the fault classification performance. This article proposes a novel data augmentation classifier (DAC) for imbalanced fault classification. Data augmentation based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is an effective way to solve the problem of unbalanced classification. However;  the randomness of the GAN generation process restricts the effect of data enhancement. DAC proposes a data selection strategy based on data filtering and data purification in model training to solve this problem. In addition;  DAC combines supervised learning and data generation processes to obtain an end-to-end model. Meanwhile;  multigenerator structure of DAC (MDAC) is proposed to solve the problem of incomplete learning of a single generator when data imbalances get complicated. The proposed DAC and MDAC are applied in two fault classification cases of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process;  results of which show superiority of DAC and MDAC compared to existing methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
