Prognosis of discrete component with intermittent fault in hybrid systems is challenging since the component has only two states (i.e.;  ON and OFF) and no associated physical parameter in the model can quantify the degradation. This article aims to solve the discrete component prognosis problem under the model-based paradigm. First;  the fault detection and isolation module help find the possible faulty discrete components. Based on the isolated possible faulty discrete components;  Levy flight biogeography-based optimization is proposed to identify the faulty discrete component states;  as well as the fault appearing and fault disappearing instants. Second;  a Weibull function-based degradation model which can capture the duration evolution of intermittent fault of discrete component in observation window (OW) is developed using coordinate reconstruction approach;  and the degradation model coefficients can be calculated from the fault identification results. After that;  the concept of failure threshold for faulty discrete component is defined based on the ratio of fault duration to OW;  which enables the prognosis of intermittent fault in discrete component. Finally;  the proposed methodologies are validated by experiment results. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
