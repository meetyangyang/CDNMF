Demanufacturing aims to recover value and conserve energy from end-of-life (EOL) products;  contributing to sustainable manufacturing. To make the full use of EOL products;  they are usually disassembled into components that have different values and embodied energy at different EOL options. This article studies a disassembly planning (DP) that integrates the decisions on disassembly sequence and EOL strategy to maximize the recovered value and energy conservation from EOL products. We propose a multiobjective DP based on the value recovery and energy conservation (MDPVE) model;  which is different from the existing DP models by focusing on the embodied energy rather than the energy consumption during disassembly. An adapted multiobjective artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm [multiobjective ABC (MOABC)] is developed to identify the Pareto solutions for the MDPVE and is compared with a well-known metaheuristic algorithm;  Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). A real-world case study demonstrated the superior solution quality and computational efficiency of MOABC.
