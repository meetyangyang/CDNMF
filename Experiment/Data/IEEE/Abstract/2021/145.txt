Deep neural networks (DNNs);  e.g.;  convolutional neural network (CNN);  are able to learn effective features from wafer maps for dimensional reduction and feature extraction. However;  very large image data are needed to train DNNs to obtain high generalization performance. It is still a difficult task due to the lack of sufficient labeled images with various defects. This article proposes a semisupervised deep transfer learning algorithm called joint feature and label adversarial network (JFLAN). JFLAN uses CNNs to extract transferable features of wafer maps and then introduces a multilayer domain adaptation and pseudolabel learning block based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). This effectively reduces the distribution discrepancy and the among-class distance of the transferable features. Finally;  JFLAN transfers knowledge from wafer image source data collected offline and then achieves the goal of significantly improved accuracy of wafer defect recognition and realizes online adaptive defect recognition. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
