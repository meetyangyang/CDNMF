Gesture recognition becomes a thriving research area in modern human motion recognition systems. The intensification of demands on efficient interactive human-machine-interface systems;  commercial objectives;  and many other factors contributes to fuel this revival dynamics. Understanding human gestures becomes essential for prevention and health monitoring applications. In particular;  analyzing hand gestures is of paramount importance in personalized healthcare-related applications to help practitioners providing more qualitative assessments of subject's pathologies;  such as Parkinson's diseases. This work proposes a novel deep neural network approach to forecast future gestures from a given sequence of hand motion using a wearable capacitance sensor of an innovative gesture recognition hardware system. To do this;  we use an attention-based recurrent neural network to capture the temporal features of hand motion to unveil the underlying pattern between the gesture and these sequences. While the attention layers capture patterns from the weights of the short term;  the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network layer learns the inherent interdependency of long-term hand gesture temporal sequences. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated with respect to cutting-edge work in the field using several metrics.
