In an era of sustainable development;  considerable emphasis has been put onto energy saving;  environment friendly;  and social welfare as well as productivity in the manufacturing sector. In this work;  an unrelated parallel manufacturing setting with time-of-use (TOU) electricity price is explored;  with an aim to reduce the electricity cost and increase productivity simultaneously. A nonlinear mathematical programming model is formulated to exploit the special structure of the scheduling problem;  where the quadratic constraints are reformulated as second-order-cone (SOC) constraints;  and several tailored cutting planes are introduced to further tighten the feasible region of the problem. Then;  the original scheduling problem is transformed into several single-machine scheduling problems with TOU electricity price;  which could be relaxed as a single-objective programming problem;  and it could be solved rapidly via commercial solvers;  such as CPLEX. Based on the optimal solution of the relaxed problem;  an approximate algorithm is proposed;  where a special rounding technique is employed to assign jobs to the unrelated parallel machines in a local search manner. Furthermore;  a lower bound model is constructed by eliminating the nonpreemption constraint;  and an iteration-based algorithm is devised to obtain the optimal solution of the lower bound problem. Meanwhile;  a dispatch rule-based approach is proposed to provide an upper bound of the scheduling problem with TOU constraint. In the numerical analysis section;  the proposed approximate algorithm is validated through extensive testing on various scales of instances;  different emphasis on productivity and electricity price;  and under two typical TOU electricity pricing policies. It is observed that the gap between the proposed approximate algorithm and CPLEX is mostly within 4%;  and the lower/upper bound methods could obtain a relaxed/feasible solution within 0.01 s.
