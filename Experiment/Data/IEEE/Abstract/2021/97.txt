Metadata in most existing building automation systems (BASs) is inconsistent;  incomplete;  and nondescriptive. This situation is a major obstacle to the widespread use of data analytics to improve the operation of buildings. In this article;  we put forward a method to infer zone-level metadata from features derived from BAS data. The method includes two steps: 1) classification of BAS points into different types (e.g.;  indoor temperature;  indoor temperature set point;  airflow;  airflow set point;  damper position;  and radiator valve position) and 2) association of BAS points based on their functional relationships (i.e.;  grouping the sensors;  actuators;  and set points of each zone together). The metadata inference method was demonstrated with data from zones served by four different air handling units (AHUs) in two office buildings in Ottawa;  ON;  Canada. The results from this case study indicate that common zone-level BAS point types can be accurately classified and associated even in the absence of intuitive data labels.
