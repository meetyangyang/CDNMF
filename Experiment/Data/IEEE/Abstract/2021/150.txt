Automation engineering is the task of integrating;  via software;  various sensors;  actuators;  and controls to automate a real-world process. Today;  automation engineering is supported by a suite of software tools;  including integrated development environments (IDEs);  hardware configurators;  compilers;  and runtimes. These tools focus on the automation code itself but leave the automation engineer unassisted in their decision-making. This can lead to longer software development cycles due to the imperfections in the decision-making;  which arise when integrating software and hardware. To address this problem;  this article addresses multiple challenges often faced in automation engineering and proposes machine learning-based solutions to assist engineers tackle these challenges. We show that machine learning can be leveraged to assist the automation engineer in classifying automation code;  finding similar code snippets;  and reasoning about the hardware selection of sensors and actuators. We validate our architecture on two real data sets consisting of 2927 Arduino projects and 683 programmable logic controller (PLC) projects. Our results show that paragraph embedding techniques can be utilized to classify automation using code snippets with precision close to human annotation;  giving an \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$F_{1}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-score of 72%. Furthermore;  we show that such embedding techniques can help us find similar code snippets with high accuracy. Finally;  we use autoencoder models for hardware recommendation and achieve a \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$p\\text{@}3$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n of 0.79 and \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$p\\text{@}5$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n of 0.95. We also present the implementation of ArduCode in a proof-of-concept user interface integrated into an existing automation engineering system platform. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
