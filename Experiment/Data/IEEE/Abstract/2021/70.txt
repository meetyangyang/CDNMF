This article proposes a novel modeling and path planning framework to tackle a new problem;  named road-network persistent surveillance problem (RPSP);  in which the occurrence location and probability of the events are unknown. To capture such events;  an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with certain detection ability must move along the road-network with different monitoring priorities to persistently monitor them. First;  we presented an event-oriented modeling method to formulate the new problem. The monitoring effect of the road-network is quantified by uncertainty;  which takes the detection ability of the sensor;  the detection interval;  and the monitoring weight into account. Based on the proposed model;  we then designed a heuristic path planning algorithm from a decision-making perspective;  which enables a UGV to persistently monitor the viewpoints of the road-network without traversing them. The simulation results and analysis demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
