This article aims to design an intelligent mobile charging control mechanism for electric vehicles (EVs);  by promoting charging reservations (including service start time;  expected charging time;  and charging location). EV mobile charging could be implemented as an alternative recharging solution;  wherein charge replenishment is provided by economically mobile plug-in chargers;  capable of providing on-site charging services. With intelligent charging management;  readily available mobile chargers are predictable and could be efficiently scheduled toward EVs with charging demand;  based on updated context collected from across the charging network. The context can include critical information relating to charging sessions and charging demand. Furthermore;  with reservations introduced;  accurate estimations on charging demand for a future moment are achievable;  and correspondingly;  optimal mobile chargers selection can be obtained. Therefore;  charging demands across the network can be efficiently and effectively satisfied;  with the support of intelligent system-level decisions. In order to evaluate critical performance attributes;  we further carry out extensive simulation experiments with practical concerns to verify our insights observed from the theoretical analysis. Results show great performance gains by promoting the reservation-based mobile charger selection;  especially for mobile chargers equipped with suffice power capacity.
