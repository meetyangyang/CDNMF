Manufacturing activities dominate the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of the industrial sector. With the increasing concerns of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change in recent years;  the significance of the performance in terms of sustainability of manufacturing has been gradually recognized by both academia and industry. Various researches have been implemented to analyze;  model;  and reduce the energy consumption of manufacturing activities toward sustainable manufacturing. In a typical manufacturing system with multiple machines and buffers;  the state of a certain machine is not only determined by the machine itself;  but also the states of the adjacent machines and buffers. Therefore;  machines may be in idle states due to nonincoming part from the upstream section of the manufacturing system or noncapacity to hold the delivered part to the downstream section of the manufacturing system. Those idle machines consume energy without production if there is no appropriate energy control strategy. In this article;  we focus on the reduction of the energy waste for those idle machines in a typical multi-machine and multi-buffer manufacturing system. A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) integrated neural network is proposed to predict the duration of the idle periods for the idle machines;  during which optimal energy control action can be identified and implemented under the constraint of production throughput of the manufacturing system. A manufacturing system simulator is built to provide the training dataset including the information;  such as production throughput;  energy consumption;  buffer content;  and failure rate;  to the proposed neural network. A numerical case study for a five-machine-and-four-buffer manufacturing system is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction model in terms of the energy waste reduction for the idle machines.
