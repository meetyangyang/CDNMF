Compared with the rapidly growing artificial intelligence (AI) research in other branches of healthcare;  the pace of developing AI capacities in dental care is relatively slow. Dental care automation;  especially the automated capability for dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) segmentation and lesion detection;  is highly needed. CBCT is an important imaging modality that is experiencing ever-growing utilization in various dental specialties. However;  little research has been done for segmenting different structures;  restorative materials;  and lesions using deep learning. This is due to multifold challenges such as content-rich oral cavity and significant within-label variation on each CBCT image as well as the inherent difficulty of obtaining many high-quality labeled images for training. On the other hand;  oral-anatomical knowledge exists in dentistry;  which shall be leveraged and integrated into the deep learning design. In this article;  we propose a novel anatomically constrained Dense U-Net for integrating oral-anatomical knowledge with data-driven Dense U-Net. The proposed algorithm is formulated as a regularized or constrained optimization and solved using mean-field variational approximation to achieve computational efficiency. Mathematical encoding for transforming descriptive knowledge into a quantitative form is also proposed. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the standard Dense U-Net in both lesion detection accuracy and dice coefficient (DICE) indices in multilabel segmentation. Benefited from the integration with anatomical domain knowledge;  our algorithm performs well with data from a small number of patients included in the training.
