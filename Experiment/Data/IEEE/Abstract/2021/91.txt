Smart customization service is an important element for smart manufacturing. The success of smart customization requires that designers;  manufacturers;  and customers with differences in context;  semantics;  and other cognitive aspects be engaged in a collaborative process. With product configurators reported to have positive impacts on product quality to meet customers' needs;  this article attempts to explore an approach for smart customization service based on configurators. To better address the semantic gap between customers and designers/manufacturers;  a new configuration mechanism is proposed that takes into consideration customer needs using natural language as the input and maps them to product specifications in the design stage. We collected a massive amount of review text from e-commerce websites and used ELMo;  a contextualized word representation based on a deep bidirectional language model;  to encode the text. A multitask learning-based neural network was adopted to build the mapping from layman customer needs to product specifications. Our experiments show that this approach can achieve a promising performance for the configuration task and;  thereby;  facilitate smart customization services.
