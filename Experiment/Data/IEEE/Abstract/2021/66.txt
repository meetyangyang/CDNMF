Frequent and wide changes in operation conditions are quite common in real process industry;  resulting in typical wide-range nonstationary and transient characteristics along time direction. The considerable challenge is;  thus;  how to solve the conflict between the learning model accuracy and change complexity for analysis and monitoring of nonstationary and transient continuous processes. In this work;  a novel condition-driven data analytics method is developed to handle this problem. A condition-driven data reorganization strategy is designed which can neatly restore the time-wise nonstationary and transient process into different condition slices;  revealing similar process characteristics within the same condition slice. Process analytics can then be conducted for the new analysis unit. On the one hand;  coarse-grained automatic condition-mode division is implemented with slow feature analysis to track the changing operation characteristics along condition dimension. On the other hand;  fine-grained distribution evaluation is performed for each condition mode with Gaussian mixture model. Bayesian inference-based distance (BID) monitoring indices are defined which can clearly indicate the fault effects and distinguish different operation scenarios with meaningful physical interpretation. A case study on a real industrial process shows the feasibility of the proposed method which;  thus;  can be generalized to other continuous processes with typical wide-range nonstationary and transient characteristics along time direction. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
