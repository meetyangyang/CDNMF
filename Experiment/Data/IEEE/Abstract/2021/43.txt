Rearranging objects on a planar surface arises in a variety of robotic applications;  such as product packaging. Using two arms can improve efficiency but introduces new computational challenges. This article studies the problem structure of object rearrangement using two arms in synchronous;  monotone tabletop setups and develops an optimal mixed-integer model. It then describes an efficient and scalable algorithm;  which first minimizes the cost of object transfers and then moves between objects. This is motivated by the fact that;  asymptotically;  object transfers dominate the cost of solutions. Moreover;  a lazy strategy minimizes the number of motion planning calls and results in significant speedups. Theoretical arguments support the benefits of using two arms and indicate that synchronous execution;  in which the two arms perform together either transfers or moves;  introduces only a small overhead. Experiments support these claims and show that the scalable method can quickly compute solutions close to the optimal for the considered setup. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
