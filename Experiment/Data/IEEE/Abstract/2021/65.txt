Estimation of the motion of an agent and its environment concurrently is done by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In the recent past;  SLAM has made rapid and exciting progress and is used in different fields such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV);  medical surgeries;  and endoscopic procedures. The aim of this article is to devise a more accurate physiotherapy exercise monitoring device on the basis of analysis from eight different SLAM algorithms with criteria including power and memory consumption;  CPU heat;  and CPU utilization. This article provides a comprehensive evaluation on an embedded platform and is first of its kind;  especially providing that SLAM systems ego-motion estimation has never been done so explicitly before. Based on the results of the prior analysis;  we proposed a stereo visual-inertial tracking (S-VIT) for lower limb tracking in physiotherapy applications. Our proposed algorithm has significantly improved results compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Data sets of various physiotherapy rehabilitation exercises for leg are also collected for detailed validations where the ground truth is acquired with a state-of-the-art motion tracking system;  Vicon. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
