To achieve high-accuracy grasping of unknown objects;  we present novel multilevel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for robotic grasping with a parallel gripper or multifingered dexterous hand. The multilevel CNNs include four levels with different structures and functions. The first level is constructed to get the approximate position of the grasped object. The second level aims to obtain the preselected grasping rectangles. The third level is constructed to re-evaluate the preselected grasping rectangles and obtain substantially detailed features with quite a large network;  so as to assess each preselected grasping rectangle exactly. By using a selection algorithm;  the optimal grasping rectangle can be determined and unknown object grasping can be achieved with a parallel gripper. The purpose of the fourth level is to obtain the finger position distribution to complete the accurate grasping of unknown objects with a multifingered dexterous hand. The test results indicate that;  compared to state-of-the-art methods;  the proposed multilevel CNNs can greatly increase the precision of the grasping rectangle. Grasping experiments were implemented on a Youbot arm with five degrees of freedom and a Shadow four-fingered dexterous hand. The results show that the multilevel CNNs can determine the optimal grasping rectangle and finger position distribution;  thereby achieving high-accuracy grasping of various unknown objects;  even under several complex environmental conditions.
