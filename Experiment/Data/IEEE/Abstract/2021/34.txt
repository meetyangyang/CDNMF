Classification of electroencephalogram-based motor imagery (MI-EEG) tasks raises a big challenge in the design and development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In view of the characteristics of nonstationarity;  time-variability;  and individual diversity of EEG signals;  a deep learning framework termed SSD-SE-convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for MI-EEG classification. The framework consists of three parts: 1) the sparse spectrotemporal decomposition (SSD) algorithm is proposed for feature extraction;  overcoming the drawbacks of conventional time-frequency analysis methods and enhancing the robustness to noise; 2) a CNN is constructed to fully exploit the time-frequency features;  thus outperforming traditional classification methods both in terms of accuracy and kappa value; and 3) the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks are adopted to adaptively recalibrate channelwise feature responses;  which further improves the overall performance and offers a compelling classification solution for MI-EEG applications. Experimental results on two datasets reveal that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both classification quality and robustness. The advantages of SSD-SE-CNN include high accuracy;  high efficiency;  and robustness to cross-trial and cross-session variations;  making it an ideal candidate for long-term MI-EEG applications.
