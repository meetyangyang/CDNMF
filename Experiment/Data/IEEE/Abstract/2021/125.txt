As the main force of energy consumption;  machines consume a huge amount of energy in some production systems. To operate the systems in an energy-efficient way;  the efficiencies of the machines should be elaborately optimized so that the total energy consumption in the production lines is minimized while maintaining the required production rate. For this purpose;  this article investigates the energy consumption optimization problem in Bernoulli serial lines having more than two machines. Specifically;  this problem is first formulated as a nonlinear programming with a production rate constraint; due to difficulties in solving this constrained nonlinear programming;  structural characteristics of the problem and properties of the objective function;  which are inspired by the results and insights obtained in two-machine lines;  are analyzed. Finally;  based on the structural characteristics and properties explored;  a solution methodology is developed to recursively solve the unique optimal solution of the energy consumption optimization problem. Extensive numerical experiments show that the solution provided by this method;  which has the reversibility property and is better than the one provided by an existing method in the literature;  is numerically optimal (note that the theoretically optimal solution is extremely hard to obtain if not totally impossible).
