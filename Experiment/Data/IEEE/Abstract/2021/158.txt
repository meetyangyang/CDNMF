We examine a scheduling problem for a dual-armed cluster tool that processes multiple similar wafer types concurrently. It has been recently proved that the well-known swap sequence;  which is widely used for single wafer type processing;  also minimizes the cycle time for concurrent processing. In this article;  we wish to minimize wafer delays in a process chamber;  which are critical to wafer quality degradation;  while maintaining the minimum cycle time. In particular;  we show that concurrent processing of wafers with different processing times complicates the analysis of wafer delays significantly;  and the wafer delays can be remarkably reduced by finding a proper cycle plan which is the release sequence of different wafer types. We first characterize wafer delays for a given cycle plan by analyzing the circuits of the timed event graph (TEG) model. From this;  we prove that concurrent processing of wafers may cause a significant workload imbalance between parallel chambers of a process step;  and hence the wafer delays increase substantially. We present that the wafer delays are minimized by a cycle plan that evenly balances workloads between parallel chambers. We also propose how wafer loading task at each process step has to be postponed to meet wafer delay constraints while maintaining the minimum cycle time. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
