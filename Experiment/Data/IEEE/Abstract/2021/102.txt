A previously developed pneumatic muscles' (PMs) actuated gait exoskeleton (with only knee joint) has been demonstrated in achieving appropriate actuation torque;  range of motion (ROM);  and control bandwidth for task-specific gait training. While the adopted multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) sliding mode (SM) strategy has preliminarily implemented simultaneous control of the exoskeleton's angular trajectory and compliance;  its efficacy with human users during gait cycles has not been investigated. This article presents an improved bi-joint gait rehabilitation exoskeleton (BiGREX) with integrated human hip and knee joints. The results with 12 healthy subjects demonstrated that the system's compliance can be effectively adjusted while guiding the subjects walking in predefined trajectories.
