This article is dedicated to developing an online collision detection and identification (CDI) scheme for human-collaborative robots. The scheme is composed of a signal classifier and an online diagnosor;  which monitors the sensory signals of the robot system;  detects the occurrence of a physical human–robot interaction;  and identifies its type within a short period. In the beginning;  we conduct an experiment to construct a data set that contains the segmented physical interaction signals with ground truth. Then;  we develop the signal classifier on the data set with the paradigm of supervised learning. To adapt the classifier to the online application with requirements on response time;  an auxiliary online diagnosor is designed using the Bayesian decision theory. The diagnosor provides not only a collision identification result but also a confidence index which represents the reliability of the result. Compared to the previous works;  the proposed scheme ensures rapid and accurate CDI even in the early stage of a physical interaction. As a result;  safety mechanisms can be triggered before further injuries are caused;  which is quite valuable and important toward a safe human–robot collaboration. In the end;  the proposed scheme is validated on a robot manipulator and applied to a demonstration task with collision reaction strategies. The experimental results reveal that the collisions are detected and classified within 20 ms with an overall accuracy of 99.6%;  which confirms the applicability of the scheme to collaborative robots in practice. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
