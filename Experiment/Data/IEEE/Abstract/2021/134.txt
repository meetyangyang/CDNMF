With the emergence of the Internet of Things that allows communications and local computations and with the vision of Industry 4.0;  a foreseeable transition is from centralized system planning and operation toward decentralization with interacting components and subsystems;  e.g.;  self-optimizing factories. In this article;  a new “price-based” decomposition and coordination methodology is developed to efficiently coordinate a system consisting of distributed subsystems such as machines and parts;  which are described by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations;  in an asynchronous way. The novel method is a dual approach;  whereby the coordination is performed by updating Lagrangian multipliers based on economic principles of “supply and demand.” To ensure low communication requirements within the method;  exchanges between the “coordinator” and subsystems are limited to “prices” (Lagrangian multipliers) broadcast by the coordinator and to subsystem solutions sent at the coordinator. Asynchronous coordination;  however;  may lead to convergence difficulties since the order in which subsystem solutions arrive at the coordinator is not predefined as a result of uncertainties in communication and solving times. Under realistic assumptions of finite communication and solve times;  the convergence of our method is proven by innovatively extending the Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical testing of generalized assignment problems through simulation demonstrates that the method converges fast and provides near-optimal results;  paving the way for self-optimizing factories in the future. Accompanying CPLEX codes and data are included. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
