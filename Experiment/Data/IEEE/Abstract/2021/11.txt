Residence time limits for the intermediate products are commonly seen in production systems due to quality requirements. A part in a buffer typically needs to be scrapped or reworked if its residence time exceeds the maximum allowable residence time;  while a part needs to keep waiting in the buffer if its residence time is less than the minimum required residence time. Such limits could be required at multiple stages of the production line;  making it difficult to analyze both the steady-state and transient production system performance. The problem under study is formulated as a multistage geometric serial production line with residence time limits. To deal with its large state space;  a two-machine-one-buffer subsystem isolated from a multistage geometric serial production line is first analyzed for both steady-state and transient performance. Furthermore;  a novel aggregation method;  including the steady-state analysis and transient analysis;  is proposed to evaluate the overall system performance. The proposed aggregation method substantially reduces the complexity of the problem and makes the analysis of the problem tractable. Compared with the simulation;  the aggregation method maintains high accuracy in estimating both steady-state and transient performance measures. Such a method provides quantitative tools for effective performance evaluation and prediction on the factory floor.
