The importance of tactile sensing for physical humanâ€“robot interaction (pHRI) and dexterous manipulation is well known. SkinSim is a novel simulation environment for tactile robot skins in which one can study design tradeoffs involved in deploying whole-body;  dense sensor arrays. In this article;  scalable modeling approaches are presented for simulating pressure-sensitive robot skin patches;  with simultaneous consideration of sensing element geometry and mechanical structure;  signal quality;  data processing;  and closed-loop force controller performance. The open-source simulation architecture of SkinSim is compatible with Gazebo and robot operating system (ROS) programming environments and supports both robot skin dynamic models;  as well as tactile sensing element models. An experimentally validated force dispersion model was introduced for the simulation of sensors embedded in a mechanical damping layer. Simulation examples of robot skin with different tactile resolutions are presented using parameter values extracted from an experimental testbed. Thus;  simulation results were experimentally validated and the skin sensor density impact on a simple pHRI controller performance was evaluated. Performance measures include center of pressure (COP) estimation error and control signal settling time;  overshoot;  and steady-state errors. Results suggest that while COP errors decrease in denser sensor skins;  controller performance also deteriorates. Therefore;  optimal robot skin designs will have to consider application-dependent tradeoffs. Similar results were confirmed in simulation with a larger skin patch containing approximately 4000 tactels and deployed on the end-effector of a collaborative mobile manipulator. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
