Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is an efficient population-based stochastic search technique. Since it was proposed;  many attempts have been made to improve its performance in the context of nonlinear continuous optimization. However;  the success of EDA depends on the accuracy of modeling;  the effectiveness of sampling;  and the ability of exploration. An effective EDA often needs to take some measures to adjust the model and to guide sampling. In this article;  we propose a novel EDA which applies the idea of Kalman filtering to revise the modeling data and a learning strategy to improve sampling. The filtering scheme modifies the modeling data set using an estimation error matrix based on historic solution data. During the sampling process;  the learning strategy determines the region to sample next based on the sampling outcomes so far;  instead of completely random sampling. The proposed EDA also employs a multivariate probabilistic model based on copula function and can quickly reach the promising area in which the optimal solution is likely to be located. A collection of general benchmark functions are used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Computational experiments show that the EDA is effective. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
