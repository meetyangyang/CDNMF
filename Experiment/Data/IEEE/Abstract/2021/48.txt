Generating robot motion for multiple tasks in dynamic environments is challenging;  requiring an algorithm to respond reactively while accounting for complex nonlinear relationships between tasks. In this article;  we develop a novel policy synthesis algorithm;  Riemannian motion policy (RMP)flow;  based on geometrically consistent transformations of RMPs. RMPs are a class of reactive motion policies that parameterize non-Euclidean behaviors as dynamical systems in intrinsically nonlinear task spaces. Given a set of RMPs designed for individual tasks;  RMPflow can combine these policies to generate an expressive global policy;  while simultaneously exploiting sparse structure for computational efficiency. We study the geometric properties of RMPflow and provide sufficient conditions for stability. Finally;  we experimentally demonstrate that accounting for the natural Riemannian geometry of task policies can simplify classically difficult problems;  such as planning through the clutter on high-degree-of-freedom manipulation systems. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
