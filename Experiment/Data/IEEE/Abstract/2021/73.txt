Nowadays;  wafer fabrication in semiconductor manufacturing is highly dependent on cluster tools. A cluster tool is equipped with several process modules (PMs) and a wafer handling robot. When the tool is operating;  generally each PM is processing a wafer;  and the robot is responsible for delivering the wafers from one PM to another. Thus;  when a wafer is completed in a PM;  the robot may be busy for performing other tasks such that it cannot immediately unload the completed wafer in the PM;  resulting in that the wafer has to stay there for some extra time. The processing time of a wafer together with its delay time for waiting for the robotâ€™s arrival for unloading is defined as wafer residency time in a PM. However;  a long wafer delay time may deteriorate its quality. Therefore;  it is highly desired and important to reduce the wafer delay time at each step as much as possible. This work aims to tackle this important issue for single-arm cluster tools (SACTs). Specifically;  by using a Petri net model;  this work analyzes the steady-state operational behavior of an SACT under the backward and earliest starting strategies. It is found that there must exist wafer delay time at the steps in the upstream of the bottleneck step;  and such wafer delay time can be reduced by properly adjusting the robot waiting time. Thus;  three algorithms are developed to reduce the wafer delay time at each step as much as possible by properly assigning the robot idle time. Finally;  the application of the proposed method is illustrated by using examples. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
