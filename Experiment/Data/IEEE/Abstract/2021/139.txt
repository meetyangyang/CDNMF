A fault-tolerant formation control (FTFC) strategy is proposed against severe actuator faults;  applied to a team of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). In the beginning;  a team of WMRs is operating in a prescribed formation topology. As long as the robot(s) cannot complete the required mission due to severe actuator faults;  the formation is reconfigured for the healthy WMRs to eliminate the fault effects. The new reconfiguration is determined by means of an optimal assignment scheme so that each healthy robot can be assigned to a unique position. Subsequently;  each robot starts planning its trajectory to reach its new position in the new formation configuration by virtue of a hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (GA–PSO). As metaheuristic optimization techniques;  such as GA and PSO;  are unable to solve the optimization problem with continuous control inputs;  control parameterization and time discretization (CPTD) method is;  therefore;  adopted to offer an approximate piecewise linearization of the control inputs. Thus;  an approach with the integration of CPTD and GA–PSO is developed. This integrated approach enables that the time of achieving the configuration is minimized;  while the physical constraints of WMRs and collision avoidance are explicitly considered. Finally;  real-time experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other optimization techniques;  such as GA and PSO. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
