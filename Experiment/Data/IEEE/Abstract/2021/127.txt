Industrial products' reuse;  recovery;  and recycling are very important due to the exhaustion of ecological resources. Effective product disassembly planning methods can improve the recovery efficiency and reduce harmful impact on the environment. However;  the existing approaches pay little attention to disassembly resources;  such as tools and operators that can significantly influence the optimal disassembly sequences. This article considers a multiobjective resource-constrained disassembly optimization problem modeled with timed Petri nets such that energy consumption is minimized;  while disassembly profit is maximized. Since its solution complexity has exponential growth with the number of components in a product;  a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on an external archive is used to solve it. Its effectiveness is verified by comparing it with nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and a collaborative resource allocation strategy for a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition.
