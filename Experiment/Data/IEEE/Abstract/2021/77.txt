In this article;  we focus on resolving the traffic flow prediction;  robot path planning;  and motion coordination problems in large-scale warehousing robotics systems with thousand-robot networks. The warehousing environment is partitioned into several sectors;  and a hierarchical framework is developed;  which includes a centralized prediction and planning level and a decentralized local coordination level. In the centralized level;  a traffic flow prediction algorithm is first proposed to predict the evolution of the robot density distribution in a future horizon and estimate the future traffic heat value of each sector. Based on this;  the sector-level robot path can be generated in the time-expended sector graph by comprehensively considering the traveling distance and the predicted traffic heat value and will be dynamically updated by considering the most recent traffic information. In the coordination level;  local cooperative A* algorithm;  incorporated with the conflict-based searching strategy;  is implemented within each sector to generate conflict-free road-level paths for all the robots in the sector simultaneously;  and the rolling planning scheme is utilized in order to immediately react to robot motion uncertainties and communication disconnections. The effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed approach are validated by large-scale simulations with more than one 1000 robots and real laboratory experiments. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
