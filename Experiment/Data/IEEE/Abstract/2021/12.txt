Performance analysis of flexible manufacturing systems has received substantial research attention. Most of the studies focus on steady-state behavior. The transient performance;  which is critical for system operation;  control;  and improvement;  is less investigated. No analytical method is available to evaluate the transients in flexible lines with unreliable machines;  finite buffers;  and setup times. In this article;  an analytical model is introduced to study the transient performance of multiproduct serial lines with Bernoulli reliability machines and nonnegligible setups during changeovers. To reduce the state-space dimension;  an approximation method is introduced to evaluate the performance in two-machine lines;  where the sequence of multiple part types in the inventory is approximated by the ratio of product mix. Such an approximation method leads to high precision of production rate estimation. Then;  for longer lines;  the analysis approach in two-machine lines is used as a building block in an iterative aggregation procedure. Numerical experiments show that the iteration procedure is convergent and results in an acceptable accuracy in performance evaluation. In addition;  system properties;  such as monotonicity and reversibility;  are investigated.
