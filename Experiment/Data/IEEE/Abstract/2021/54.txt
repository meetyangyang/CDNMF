Existing projector-camera calibration methods typically warp keypoints from a camera image to a projector image using estimated homographies and often suffer from errors in camera parameters and noises due to imperfect planarity of the calibration target. This article proposes a practical and robust projector-camera calibration system that explicitly deals with these challenges. First;  a graph-theory-based correspondence algorithm is built on top of a color-coded spatial structured light (SL) pattern. Such SL correspondences are then used for a coarse projector-camera calibration. To gain more robustness against noises from an imperfect planar calibration board;  we develop a bundle adjustment algorithm to jointly optimize the estimated projector-camera parameters and the correspondencesâ€™ coordinates. Moreover;  our system requires only one shot of an SL pattern for each calibration board pose;  which is much more practical than multishot solutions. Comprehensive experimental validation is conducted on both synthetic and real data sets;  and our method clearly outperforms the existing methods in all experiments. For the benefit of the society;  a practical open-source software with graphical user interface (GUI) of the developed system is publicly available at \n<monospace xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><uri>https://github.com/bingyaohuang/single-shot-pro-cam-calib</uri></monospace>\n. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
