In recent years;  the research on robust deadlock control has become increasingly popular in automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) because resource failures may lead any system to stagnation;  e.g.;  deadlock. In this article;  we study robust supervisory control issues in AMSs with multiple unreliable resources. Petri nets are used to model the considered AMSs that allow multi-quantity and multi-type of resource acquisitions. A set of integer linear programming formulations are introduced to detect a class of deadlocks that have the maximal number of dead transitions. By analysis;  a deadlock is characterized by a saturated circuit;  which only consists of a set of unmarked resources and a set of critical transitions. Based on the circuit;  a linear marking constraint is developed to prevent such circuits from being saturated. A control place (monitor) with its control variable is thus designed for the constraint to prevent the deadlock from appearing even if some resource failures occur. Therefore;  we can synthesize a robust deadlock supervisor;  which can guarantee that the controlled system can implement the continual operations even if some unreliable resources fail. Finally;  the theoretical analysis and comparative study are provided to elucidate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
