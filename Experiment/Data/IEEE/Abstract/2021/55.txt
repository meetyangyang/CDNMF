Safe transmission of oil pipelines is one of the guarantees of national defense and environmental protection. Magnetic flux leakage (MFL) testing is critical to the safety inspection of in-service pipelines. In the detection process;  the incompleteness of MFL data affects defect location and inversion severely. This article proposes an MFL data recovery method based on multifeature condition risk;  which can effectively handle the block data gap problem. First;  a preprocessing mechanism is proposed to determine defect boundaries and uniformly interpolate the raw data automatically. Second;  a multifeature extraction method of MFL defect data is proposed;  which takes full advantage of the complete data and reduces the impact of data gaps. Third;  a novel data reconstruction method based on feature conditional risk is proposed;  where prior information of MFL data is regressed;  relying on the regression coefficient calculated by dynamic programming. Finally;  comparison experiments on different sizes of data gaps;  varying robustness;  and average running time are conducted;  respectively. The MFL data are derived from actual measurements. The results indicate that the proposed method is more robust;  more efficient;  and faster. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
