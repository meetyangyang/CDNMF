In a dynamic environment;  moving to the destination safely and effectively is of paramount importance for an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). This article presents a strategy of trajectory planning and tracking that aims to ensure the UGV’s safety in an uncertain environment. Specifically;  based on the initial environment information;  a global optimal trajectory connecting the start and the destination is predefined by an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA). In the presence of unforeseen obstacles;  a trial-based forward search (TFS) algorithm based on the Markov chain is proposed in the local trajectory planning module;  while collision prediction is integrated as heuristic information. The vehicle’s current state is updated accordingly for the sake of avoiding entire state spaces involved in the computation. Therefore;  the storage efficiency and convergence rate in local path planning are sufficiently enhanced in comparison to dynamic programming. Moreover;  command signals can be calculated with the proposed multiconstrained model predictive controller (MMPC);  ensuring the vehicle to track the reference trajectory and smoothen the motion. Finally;  the results in both simulations and experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
