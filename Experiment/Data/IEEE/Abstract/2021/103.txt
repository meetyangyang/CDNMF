This article analyzes the backward sequence for single-armed cluster tools with processing time variations. The backward sequence is popularly used to operate a single-armed cluster tool in practice;  but its performance has not been analyzed when processing time variations are introduced. To address the problem;  we first define a fundamental cycle and derive a formula for cycle time analysis considering processing time variations. We then develop conditions for which the backward sequence is optimal for a certain cycle or all cycles. We also analyze the upper bound of the average cycle time with the backward sequence. Finally;  the performance of the backward sequence with processing time variations is investigated experimentally.
