Robotic cell scheduling problem with batch-processing machines (RCSP-BMs) needs to determine the processing sequence and the transferring sequence simultaneously. The buffer size before and after the batch-processing machines has a big influence on the scheduling solution. A big amount of energy is always consumed by batch-processing machines. Hybrid flow shop scheduling has been proven NP-hard;  and the features of the batch-processing machines in a flow shop make the hybrid flow shop scheduling more difficult. This study proposes a multiobjective differential evolution (DE) algorithm to address these issues. First;  a mathematical optimization model is formulated for the RCSP-BMs to minimize makespan and energy consumption of the batch-processing machines. Second;  the multiobjective DE algorithm (MODE) is developed. A green scheduling algorithm is designed to decode the individuals to balance the makespan and energy consumption. A local search method is also presented to help the searching escape from the local optimum. Finally;  experiments are carried out;  and the results show that the MODE can solve the robotic cell scheduling problem with batch-processing machines effectively and efficiently.
