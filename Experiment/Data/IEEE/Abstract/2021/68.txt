The color-coated steel coil is a high value-added product for steel enterprises;  and its production process is affected by multiple factors. How to provide operators with appropriate scheduling schemes is the key to improve the economic benefits of enterprises. In this article;  for the scheduling of a single color-coating turn;  we establish a multiobjective optimization model that minimizes the number of insertions of transition coils;  the thickness jump penalty of adjacent coils;  and the switching times of the backup rollers. To address this problem;  we propose a piecewise coding approach to ensure that each individual meets the production constraints. Besides;  a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based on decomposition and dynamic local search (D-DLS) strategy is proposed (MOEA/D-DLS). More specifically;  the color-coating multiobjective scheduling problem is decomposed into a series of single-objective subproblems and optimized simultaneously. Furthermore;  based on the speed of evolution of these subproblems;  local search is performed on partial subproblems dynamically. The proposed algorithm is used to solve eight multiobjective scheduling problem instances of color-coating with different scales;  and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very effective compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
