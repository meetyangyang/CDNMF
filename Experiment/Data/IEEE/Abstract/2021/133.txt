Recently;  many methods based on low-rank representation have been proposed for fabric defect detection. Most of them relax the low-rank decomposition problem to a nuclear norm minimization (NNM) problem to pursue the convexity of the objective function. When solving the standard NNM problem;  matrix singular values have to be treated equally. This;  however;  would be impractical in the scenario of fabric defect detection as the matrix singular values have clear physical meanings;  and thus;  they should be treated differently. In this article;  we propose a weighted double-low-rank decomposition method (WDLRD) to treat the matrix singular values differently by assigning different weights. Thus;  the most important/distinguishing characteristics of a fabric image can be preserved. Another difference between WDLRD and the other existing low-rank-based methods is that WDLRD considers a defective fabric image being decomposed to two low-rank matrices;  i.e.;  low-rank defect-free matrix and low-rank defect matrix;  as the defect-free and defective regions are usually composed of homogeneous objects that have a high correlation. Besides;  WDLRD is more robust for defect detection in various situations by adding a noise term to avoid noise or other interference on the fabric surface. In addition;  a defect prior is incorporated into the objective function of WDLRD to guide locating the defective regions. The proposed optimization problem can be easily solved by an iterative algorithm based on augmented Lagrange multipliers. Experimental results on TILDA;  periodically patterned fabric;  and Textile & Apparel Artificial Intelligence databases show that the proposed WDLRD obtains better performance than state-of-the-art methods in locating the defective regions on fabric images. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
