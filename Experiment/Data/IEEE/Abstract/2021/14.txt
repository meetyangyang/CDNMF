Modern production systems are becoming more and more complex to comply with diversified market needs;  flexible production;  and competitiveness. Despite technological progress;  the presence of human operators is still fundamental in production plants;  since they have the important role of supervising and monitoring processes;  by interacting with such complex machines. The complexity of machines implies an increased complexity of human-machine interfaces (HMIs);  which are the main point of contact between the operator and the machine. Thus;  HMIs cannot be considered anymore an accessory to the machine and their improvement has become an important part of the design of the whole machines;  to enable a nonstressful interaction and make them easy to also use less skilled operators. In this article;  we present a general framework for the design of HMIs that adapt to the skills and capabilities of the operator;  with the ultimate aim of enabling a smooth and efficient interaction and improving user's situation awareness. Adaptation is achieved by considering three different levels: perception (i.e.;  how information is presented);  cognition (i.e.;  what information is presented);  and interaction (i.e.;  how interaction is enabled). For each level;  general guidelines for adaptation are provided;  thus defining a meta-HMI independent of the application. Finally;  some examples of how the proposed adaptation patterns can be applied to the case of procedural and extraordinary maintenance tasks are presented.
