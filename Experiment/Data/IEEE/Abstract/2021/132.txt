Leveraging explicit communication and cooperation of multiple robots brings about multiple advantages in the solution of tasks with autonomous robotic agents. For this reason;  to the end of transporting polygonal objects with a group of mobile robots;  the aim of this article is to develop a fully distributed decision-making and control scheme that lets the robots cooperate as equals;  without any kind of central control instance. Apart from coordinating the motions of the robots in a distributed manner;  challenges include the self-reliant determination of configurations of the robots around the object;  as well as the interrobot negotiation on which robot takes which role or position in the transportation process. Based on some assumptions on the properties of the robots and the considered types of objects;  all major aspects of the control scheme are explained in detail;  with the most crucial parts making use of optimization-based schemes. This enables unprecedented flexibility by letting the robots automatically adapt to a wide range of scenarios;  with different numbers of robots cooperating;  and accommodating intricate object shapes. A simulation-based analysis reveals some of the key properties of the proposed scheme;  whereas hardware-in-the-loop experiments show the practical applicability with inexpensive hardware. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
