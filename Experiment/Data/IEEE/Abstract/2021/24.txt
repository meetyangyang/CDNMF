Understanding the effects of different hip assistance modes is a fundamental step in the process of designing hip assistance devices and controllers that can provide better performance in terms of metabolic cost. We have developed and tested a soft exoskeleton for hip assistance;  which includes three assistance modes: hip extension assistance (HEA);  hip flexion assistance (HFA);  and hip extension and flexion assistance (HEFA). A proportional derivative (PD) iterative learning controller based on the feedforward model was proposed to control the assistive force accurately. The three hip assistance modes were evaluated on seven male subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 5 km/h in two scenarios-first with a 15-kg backpack and then without any backpack. The net metabolic costs could be reduced during the loaded condition;  compared with those under no exoskeleton condition;  by 9.95%;  6.25%;  and 15.28% for HEA;  HFA;  and HEFA;  respectively. The reductions were found significant in HEA ( p=0.048) and HEFA ( p=0.005) modes;  while the HFA mode ( p=0.202) was not found statistically significant. It indicates that the HEA and HEFA modes with the soft exoskeleton provide more benefit to the net metabolic cost compared with the HFA mode. The net metabolic costs reduced during the unloaded condition were 9.21%;  2.58%;  and 13.05% for HEA;  HFA;  and HEFA;  respectively. The improvements in the walking efficiency during both the conditions with the developed soft exoskeleton are demonstrated.
