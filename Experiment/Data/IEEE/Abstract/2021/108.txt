Home care (HC) services represent an effective solution to face the health issues related to population aging. However;  several scheduling problems arise in HC;  and the providers must make several scheduling and routing decisions;  e.g.;  the assignment of caregivers to clients;  in order to balance operating costs and client satisfaction. Starting from the analysis of a real HC provider operating in New York City;  NY;  USA;  this article addresses a scheduling problem with chargeable overtime and preference matching and formulates it as an integer programming model. The objective is to minimize a cost function that includes traveling costs;  the overtime cost paid by the provider;  the preference mismatch;  and a penalty related to the continuity of care violation. To solve this problem;  we design a matheuristic algorithm that integrates a specific variable neighborhood search with a set covering model. The results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our approach to solving real-size instances. Sensitivity analyses are also performed to discuss practical insights.
