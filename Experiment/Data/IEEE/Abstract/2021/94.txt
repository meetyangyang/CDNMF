The optical tracking system (OTS) plays a vital role in the computer-assisted surgical navigation process;  whereas the performance of the commonly used binocular stereo vision is affected by the line-of-sight problem and limited workspace. Thus;  this article proposed a prior knowledge-based multicamera reconstruction model (PKRM) to both expand the tracking workspace and improve the tracking robust and computational efficiency of OTS when working in unstructured clinical conditions. This reconstruction model inherits the advantages of the geometrical method;  data-driven method;  and gating technique (GT). First;  we added the geometric principle as the prior knowledge to optimize the training of the multicamera OTS reconstruction model through the Lagrange multiplier method; hence;  the prior knowledge feedforward NN (PKFNN) was built. Second;  besides the training features;  the state of camera (SOC) was extracted in advance to determine the NN structure using GT. According to the SOC feature;  the OTS can be self-adaptive to the changing field of view (FOV) caused by optical occlusion;  which is frequently occurred in surgery. Furthermore;  experiments were carried out to verify the performance of the proposed model;  whose accuracy and runtime performed 0.4627 mm and 0.0016 ms;  respectively. Results demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction model can achieve higher accuracy and computational efficiency than both the geometrical model and the data-driven model. Especially;  by considering SOC as the state prior knowledge;  the tracking robustness is enhanced when one or two of the four cameras are not working properly.
