Energy efficiency modeling is of great importance to energy management and conservation for machinery enterprises. To improve the generalization ability;  this article combines the machining parameters and the configuration parameters into energy efficiency models;  for which machine-learning (ML) algorithms are used considering the lack of theoretical formulas. Based on the three-year data collected in a shop floor;  a comparative study for two different cases is conducted with a particular focus on prediction accuracy;  stability;  and computational efficiency. In Case 1;  only cross-sectional data are used to predict energy efficiency;  ignoring the deterioration of spindle motors and cutting tools. Three traditional ML algorithms;  i.e.;  artificial neural networks;  support vector regression;  and Gaussian process regression;  are evaluated with the help of five error metrics. In Case 2;  we construct the models in a more realistic situation that considers the dynamic aspects of spindle motor aging and tool wear. A convolutional neural network;  a stacked autoencoder;  a deep belief network and the aforementioned traditional ML algorithms are investigated. The comparison shows that all the models in Case 1 suffer from performance degradation;  while deep learning achieves the long-term improvement in accuracy.
