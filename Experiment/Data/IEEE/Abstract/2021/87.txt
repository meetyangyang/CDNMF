Most industrial systems frequently switch their operation modes due to various factors;  such as the changing of raw materials;  static parameter setpoints;  and market demands. To guarantee stable and reliable operation of complex industrial processes under different operation modes;  the monitoring strategy has to adapt different operation modes. In addition;  different operation modes usually have some common patterns. To address these needs;  this article proposes a structure dictionary learning-based method for multimode process monitoring. In order to validate the proposed approach;  extensive experiments were conducted on a numerical simulation case;  a continuous stirred tank heater (CSTH) process;  and an industrial aluminum electrolysis process;  in comparison with several stateof-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed method performs better than other conventional methods. Compared with conventional methods;  the proposed approach overcomes the assumption that each operation mode of industrial processes should be modeled separately. Therefore;  it can effectively detect faulty states. It is worth to mention that the proposed method can not only detect the faulty of the data but also classify the modes of normal data to obtain the operation conditions so as to adopt an appropriate control strategy.
