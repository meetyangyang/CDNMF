This article presents a fixed-time accommodation strategy of actuator faults for hypersonic gliding vehicles (HGVs). The approach against actuator faults is incorporated by sliding mode control (SMC);  bilimit homogeneity;  and adaptive techniques;  with consideration of practical constraints and model uncertainties. The resulting fault-tolerant attitude control law allows the fault compensation to be completed in a fixed time;  in view of the limited time available for recovery of a faulty HGV. The effectiveness of the presented scheme is validated by comparing it to the finite-time fault accommodation scheme. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
