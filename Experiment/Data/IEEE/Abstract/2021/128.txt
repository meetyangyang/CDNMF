The significant growth in the number and types of tasks of heterogeneous applications in green cloud data centers (GCDCs) dramatically increases their providers' revenue from users as well as energy consumption. It is a big challenge to maximize such revenue;  while minimizing energy cost in a market where prices of electricity;  availability of renewable power generation;  and behind-the-meter renewable generation contract models differ among the geographical sites of the GCDCs. A multiobjective optimization method that investigates such spatial differences in the GCDCs is for the first time proposed to trade off such two objectives by cost-effectively executing all tasks while meeting their delay constraints. In each time slot;  a constrained biobjective optimization problem is formulated and solved by an improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition. Realistic data-based simulations prove that the proposed method achieves a larger total profit in faster convergence speed than the two state-of-the-art algorithms.
