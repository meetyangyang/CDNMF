Steady-state analysis on production systems;  especially serial lines with rigid production mode;  have been carried out in a large amount of research literature. With the development of the advanced manufacturing technologies;  as well as the national strategies;  for example;  Made in China 2025;  real-time performance evaluation;  prediction;  production management;  and efficient control of systems with flexible production mode are gradually becoming important issues. Under the assumption of assembly systems with small batch-based production tasks;  we develop a mathematical model for the real-time performance analysis of such systems with the geometric machine reliability model;  which is applicable in many manufacturing environments. The formulas for real-time performance analysis are derived first using the Markovian approach for three-machine assembly systems. Then;  based on the idea of decomposition and aggregation;  an algorithm with high accuracy and efficiency for system real-time performance approximation is proposed. Finally;  the decomposition and aggregation-based real-time analysis approach is extended to the generalized assembly systems. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
