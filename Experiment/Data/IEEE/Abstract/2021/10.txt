Aggregation method has been widely utilized to evaluate the performance measures of production lines. However;  traditional aggregation method (TAM) has low prediction accuracy in production lines with multiple bottlenecks;  such as “inverted bowl” lines and “oscillatory” lines. Therefore;  the root causes of the low prediction accuracy are first investigated. Extensive numerical studies indicate that A-units are one of the major causes;  where a A-unit is defined as the subsystem between two consecutive bottlenecks. Then;  an improved aggregation method (IAM) is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of TAM. IAM is established by extending the traditional two-machine aggregation building blocks to general multimachine aggregation building blocks in A-units. Specifically;  for a small-scale A-unit;  an aggregation building block is established for all the machines and buffers in the A-unit. For a large-scale A-unit;  a heuristic rule is proposed to divide the A-unit into several small-scale production line segments;  where an aggregation building block is established for each segment. Numerical studies indicate that IAM can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of the aggregation method while maintaining a reasonable computational efficiency.
