This article presents a design for interlocking blocks and an algorithm that allows these blocks to be assembled into desired shapes. During and after assembly;  the structure is kinematically interlocked if a small number of blocks are immobilized relative to other blocks. There are two types of blocks: cubes and double-height posts;  each with a particular set of male and female joints. Layouts for shapes involving thousands of blocks have been planned automatically;  and shapes with several hundred blocks have been built by hand. This article also describes a method for assembling structures from blocks in parallel. As a proof of concept;  a dual-robot system was used to assemble 48 blocks;  forming an interlocking cube-like structure. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
