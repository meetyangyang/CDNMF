Registering two point sets (PSs) is an essential problem in medical robotics and computer-assisted surgery (CAS). As one typical example;  in computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS);  the preoperative scan has to be aligned with the intraoperative scan accurately. In this article;  we first formally formulate the generalized PS registration problem in a probabilistic manner. Especially;  not only positional but also orientational information is incorporated into the registration. Notably;  the positional error is assumed to obey a multivariate Gaussian distribution to accommodate the anisotropic noise. The expectationâ€“maximization (EM) framework is utilized to solve the maximum likelihood (ML) problem. In the E-step;  the correspondence probabilities between points in two generalized PSs are computed. In the M-step;  the constrained optimization problem with respect to the rigid transformation matrix is reformulated as an unconstrained one. This is achieved by utilizing the Rodrigues parameterization to represent the rotation matrix. Both extensive simulated and real experiments are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm by comparing it with state-of-the-art registration methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
