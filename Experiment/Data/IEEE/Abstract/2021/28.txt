Registration is an essential problem in image-guided surgery (IGS) since it brings different involved coordinate frames together. Nonrigid or deformable registration still faces many challenges;  such as two point sets (PSs) are partially overlapped. To tackle the challenges in the nonrigid registration;  we introduce a new two-step point-based registration pipeline that includes two steps. In the first step;  the rigid transformation between the two spaces is recovered where the orientation vectors are adopted. In the second step;  built on the nonrigid coherent point drift (CPD) approach;  the anisotropic positional noise is also assumed. Registration results on the human liver verify the proposed approach' great improvements over the other methods. First;  the rotation and translation are recovered with smaller error values than the existing methods. Second;  our registration method's performance is much more robust to the partial overlapping between two PSs. Third;  the two-step registration framework achieves the best performances in most test cases when there is a localization error in acquiring the intraoperative data.
