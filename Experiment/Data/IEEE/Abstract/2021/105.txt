For practical mechanical systems;  uncertainties/disturbances;  such as unmodeled dynamics and frictions;  are nonignorable factors. For existing control methods;  these factors are usually neglected or addressed by a robust way. As a consequence;  the nominal control performance of these methods is sacrificed. Moreover;  there exists the chattering problem for some existing robust methods;  such as sliding mode control laws. To deal with these drawbacks;  a continuous global sliding mode controller along with a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed for the regulation and disturbance estimation control of the overhead crane system. Specifically;  the original crane dynamic model is transformed into a quasi-integrator-chain form through some transformations. Then;  a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed and a continuous global sliding mode control method is introduced on the basis of the constructed disturbance observer. The stability and convergence characteristics are proven through rigorous theoretical analysis. Finally;  to demonstrate the performance of the designed controller;  a series of experimental tests are performed;  and a comparison study between the devised method here and an existing method is given.
