The resonant controller (RC);  as a promising candidate for high-speed nonraster nanopositioning applications;  can track the sinusoidal reference with zero steady-state error. This article presents a controller composed of several RCs in parallel for tracking nonraster sequential scanning trajectories. The selection for each RC in the parallel array is based on two considerations: one is the spectrum of the reference signal and the other is the harmonics caused by the nonlinearities of the nanopositioning stage. The performance of RC is highly dependent on the accurate placement of the resonant poles;  but unfortunately;  many existing digital implementation methods could cause a deviation of the resonant poles from their initial locations. To address this problem;  a modified Tustin (MTus) method is proposed in this article to implement the controller with better accuracy. Furthermore;  the fractional-order (FO) calculus is introduced to improve the transient performance of the RCs. To validate the proposed methods;  a comprehensive examination of several types of the nonraster sequential scanning trajectories with a wide frequency range has been carried out on a nanopositioning stage. The results have been compared with other methods;  showing that the tracking errors are reduced significantly under the controller implemented by the MTus method especially in high-frequency conditions and that the application of the FO calculus reduces the settling time of the controller by more than 30% in most cases. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
