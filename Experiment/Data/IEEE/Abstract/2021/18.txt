The current trends in personalized products drive the paradigms of production systems toward autonomous networked manufacturing systems. This article proposes an ontology-based holonic event-driven architecture for implementing loosely coupled;  holonic;  autonomous distributed systems. The event-driven architecture (EDA) enables the services provided by different organizations and their suborganizations to be autonomously configured and integrated;  while ensuring that the predefined organizational event access rules are compulsorily followed. This is realized by organizing the event services in a holonic manager and modeling the knowledge of services via the ontology developed in this study. The ontology model and the corresponding autonomous configuration mechanism are introduced. We developed a demonstration case to elaborate our approach and implemented a testbed using Java-based technology for testing the effectiveness;  efficiency;  scalability;  and reliability of the proposed approach.
