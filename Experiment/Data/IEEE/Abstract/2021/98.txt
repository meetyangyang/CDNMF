Nowadays;  the entire world is facing challenges in energy and environment. To resolve these problems;  the power systems are interconnected to promote the development of renewable energy sources (RESs). However;  the economic dispatch (ED) problem for the global energy interconnection (GEI) should tackle two issues: 1) handle the uncertainty from RES and allocate the responsibility among the interconnected countries and 2) protect the information privacy through the dispatch. Motivated by the above;  this article proposes a zonally adjustable robust decentralized ED model for the GEI. In the model;  each country is only responsible for its own uncertainty;  and tie-line power flows remain unchanged under uncertainties. Moreover;  an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based fully distributed algorithm is used;  in which only limited information should be exchanged between neighboring countries. Finally;  a case study on the Northeast Asian countries verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.
