In this article;  we focus on a joint scheduling problem that considers the corrective maintenance (CM) due to unexpected breakdowns and the scheduled preventive maintenance (PM) in a generic M-machine flow shop. The objective is to find the optimal job sequence and PM schedule such that the total of the tardiness cost;  PM cost;  and CM cost is minimized. Currently;  most existing studies on the PM schedules are based on a fixed PM interval;  which is rigid and may lead to poor performance;  as the fixed strategy fails to effectively balance the trade-offs between the production scheduling and maintenance. To address this critical research issue;  our novel idea is to dynamically update the PM interval based on the real-time machine age;  such that the maintenance activity coordinates with the job scheduling to the maximum extent;  which results in an overall cost saving. Specifically;  a correction factor is introduced to dynamically update the PM interval and to help evaluate whether it is worthwhile to process the job first at the risk of the CM before performing the PM action. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive strategy;  simulations and a case study on mining operations are conducted to show that the adaptive strategy outperforms the existing methods with a less total cost.
