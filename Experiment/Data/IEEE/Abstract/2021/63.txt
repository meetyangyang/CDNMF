This article proposes a standalone radio frequency identification (RFID)-based mobile robot navigation method;  in which a mobile robot equipped with reader antennas can be continuously guided to a static object marked with a single passive UHF RFID tag. An observation model based on the RFID phase difference is built and integrated into a particle filter;  by which the instantaneous relative position between the mobile robot and the tagged object can be detected in real time. Based on the position information extracted from the RFID system;  the mobile robot adjusts its pose to move toward the RFID-tagged object. Compared with the existing RFID-based mobile robot navigation methods;  the proposed method requires no external sensors other than the RFID and requires only a single passive tag. Experiments using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices are performed;  and the results indicate that the mobile robot can satisfactorily realize navigation task with a distance accuracy of 4.04 cm and a bearing accuracy of 2.23Â°. The proposed method is well applicable for the navigation scenes in which the absolute position of the tagged target object is not known beforehand. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
