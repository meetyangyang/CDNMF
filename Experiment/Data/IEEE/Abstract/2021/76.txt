Persistent monitoring on terrains using mobile robotic sensors requires coordinated planning. Terrain features add visibility obstacles and limited fuel capacity of aerial robots leads to range restrictions that make the problem challenging. We address the visual-monitoring problem on piecewise linear features within a terrain using multiple mobile robots for persistent operations. The planner must account for visual coverage;  refueling aerial robots during the mission;  and placement of refueling depots while also utilizing the available sensor diversity to minimize overall costs for the monitoring mission. Building on previous works on visibility in specific classes of polygons and fuel-constrained routing;  we develop a discrete representation of the problem that allows the design and application of discrete optimization techniques to find optimal solutions. We develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and discuss a branch-and-cut implementation to compute exact solutions. We also develop a construction heuristic based on the idea of competitive construction of robot paths using a step-increment strategy. We report the results from computational simulations and illustrate proof of concept using experiments on real robots. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
