In recent years;  lower limb exoskeletons have gained considerable interest in applications of walking assistance for paraplegic patients. In daily lives;  the exoskeleton should have the ability to help the patients to walk over different terrains. For sloped terrains;  how to plan the stepping locations on slopes with different gradients and generate stable human-like gaits for patients is a critical issue. In this article;  we proposed a slope gradient estimator (SGE) based on the sensor data fusion of the exoskeleton and combined SGE with the capture point theory and dynamic movement primitives (DMP) to construct an adaptive gait planning approach for slopes. After learning from demonstrated gaits sampled from healthy subjects;  adaptive gait trajectories can be reproduced online to adapt to slopes with different gradients. The efficiency of the proposed approach was demonstrated on an exoskeleton system named AIDER. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can endow exoskeletons with the ability to generate appropriate gaits for different slopes.
