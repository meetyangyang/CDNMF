A novel radio frequency identification (RFID)-based mobile robot global localization method combining two kinds of RFID signal information;  i.e.;  phase difference and readability;  is proposed. Specifically;  a phase difference model and a classification logic strategy based on readability are built and integrated into a particle filter localization algorithm. Compared with existing RFID localization methods;  the proposed localization method can achieve competitive localization performance in an environment with a relatively sparse reference tag distribution and without the need for offline phase drift calibration. A series of real experimental tests were performed;  and the results show that the proposed method can localize a mobile robot with centimeter-level position accuracy and satisfactory attitude angle accuracy when the distance between adjacent reference tags is approximately 60 cm;  even if all RFID devices are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS). The proposed method provides a promising option for mobile robot localization applications;  such as path tracking of mobile robots. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
