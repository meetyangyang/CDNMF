Odd-harmonic repetitive control (ORC) has been successfully applied to improve the triangular trajectory tracking performance of nanopositioners. However;  the conventional ORC tends to amplify the tracking errors at frequencies other than the odd-harmonic components;  mainly the even harmonics of the fundamentals of the intended triangular trajectory to be tracked. Due to the influence from the hysteresis nonlinearity of the piezoelectric actuator;  this would result in significant tracking errors. To overcome this limitation;  this article proposes an enhanced odd-harmonic repetitive control (EORC) using the spectrum-selection filtering scheme to improve the loop-shaping property of the ORC. This effectively eliminates the problem of amplifying the tracking errors while preserving the advantages of the conventional ORC;  such as fast convergence speed and low computation cost. The EORC is combined with a proportionalâ€“integral tracking controller to improve the tracking performance. The controller design;  stability analysis;  and performance evaluation are presented. The experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed EORC-based control scheme are presented showing the excellent tracking of triangular trajectories with fundamental frequencies up to 1000 Hz. Moreover;  a reduction in rms tracking errors by up to 52% is achieved. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
