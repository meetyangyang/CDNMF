This article addresses the tracking control problem of 3-D trajectories for underactuated underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including obstacles. More specifically;  a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is presented for the case of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) (i.e.;  unicycle-like vehicles actuated only in the surge;  heave;  and yaw). The purpose of the controller is to steer the unicycle-like AUV to the desired trajectory with guaranteed input and state constraints (e.g.;  obstacles;  predefined vehicle velocity bounds;  and thruster saturations) inside a partially known and dynamic environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace is constantly updated via the vehicleâ€™s onboard sensors. In particular;  considering the sensing range of the vehicle;  obstacle avoidance with any of the detected obstacles is guaranteed by the online generation of a collision-free trajectory tracking path;  despite the model dynamic uncertainties and the presence of external disturbances representing ocean currents and waves. Finally;  realistic simulation studies verify the performance and efficiency of the proposed framework. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
