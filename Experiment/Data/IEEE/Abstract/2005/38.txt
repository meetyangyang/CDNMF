This paper introduces multi-depot vehicle routing problem with fixed distribution of vehicles (MDVRPFD) which is one important and useful variant of the traditional multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in the supply chain management and transportation studies. After modeling the MDVRPFD as a binary programming problem;  we propose two solution methodologies: two-stage and one-stage approaches. The two-stage approach decomposes the MDVRPFD into two independent subproblems;  assignment and routing;  and solves them separately. In contrast;  the one-stage approach integrates the assignment with the routing where there are two kinds of routing methods-draft routing and detail routing. Experimental results show that our new one-stage algorithm outperforms the published methods.
