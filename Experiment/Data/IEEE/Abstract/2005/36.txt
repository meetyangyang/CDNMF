This research is focused on developing trajectory planning tools for the automotive painting industry. The geometric complexity of automotive surfaces and the complexity of the spray patterns produced by modern paint atomizers combine to make this a challenging and interesting problem. This paper documents our efforts to develop computationally tractable analytic deposition models for electrostatic rotating bell (ESRB) atomizers;  which have recently become widely used in the automotive painting industry. The models presented in this paper account for both the effects of surface curvature as well as the deposition pattern of ESRB atomizers in a computationally tractable form;  enabling the development of automated trajectory generation tools. We present experimental results used to develop and validate the models;  and verify the interaction between the deposition pattern;  the atomizer trajectory;  and the surface curvature. Limitations of the deposition model with respect to predictions of paint deposition on highly curved surfaces are discussed.
