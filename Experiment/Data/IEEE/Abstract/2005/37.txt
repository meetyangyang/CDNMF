In this study;  an automatic mold polishing system (AMPS) has been successfully developed. The AMPS integrates with mold geometry process kernel;  path planner;  process planner;  and force control robot into a system. The polishing path is generated and drawn on the three-dimensional mold surface for verification. The AMPS can also automatic process the task planning according to the polishing requirements of the mold. The task list includes all the procedures and optimal polishing parameters. The polishing tasks were then executed by a force controllable robot. The experiment shows that the resultant of surface roughness satisfies the expectation in the process planning.
