In an earlier paper;  the authors introduced the notion of safety control of stochastic discrete event systems (DESs);  modeled as controlled Markov chains. Safety was specified as an upper bound on the components of the state probability distribution;  and the class of irreducible and aperiodic Markov chains were analyzed relative to this safety criterion. Under the assumption of complete state observations: 1) the authors identified the set of all state-feedback controllers that enforce the safety specification;  for all safe initial probability distributions and 2) for any given state-feedback controller;  the authors constructed the maximal invariant safe set (MISS). In this paper;  the authors extend the work in several ways: 1) safety is specified in terms of both upper and lower bounds; 2) we consider a larger class of Markov chains that includes reducible and periodic chains; 3) we present a more general iterative algorithm for computing the MISS;  which is quite flexible in its initialization; 4) we obtain an explicit upper bound for the number of iterations needed for the algorithm to terminate.
