A system-theoretic method;  referred to as overlapping decomposition;  is presented to evaluate the performance of a complex manufacturing system with assembly;  parallel;  rework;  feedforward;  and scrap operations. The idea of the method is to decompose the complex system into a set of serial production lines;  with the first or last machines of each serial line overlapped with another line;  and to modify the parameters of overlapping machines to accommodate the effects of machines and buffers in other lines. Iterative procedures are introduced to estimate the system production rate. The convergence of the procedures and the uniqueness of the solutions are proved analytically and the accuracy of the estimates is evaluated numerically.
