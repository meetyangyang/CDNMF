Many modern spray deposition processes;  such as spray painting or coating;  are automated by using a robot to move an applicator in a series of passes over the surface being sprayed. Determining the robot path that creates the required coat thickness over the surface can be considered as an optimization problem;  which traditionally has been solved in the spatial domain. In this paper;  results from sampling theory are used to transfer the problem into the spatial frequency domain;  which determines the optimal separation between passes. The paper also shows how angled raster patterns can be combined to provide a continuous path over the surface that generates the required distribution of deposited material.
