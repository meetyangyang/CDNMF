This paper describes a novel robotic end-effector and a method for grasping deformable objects with undefined shapes and geometry;  such as sacks and bags. The first prototype end-effector;  designed for applications in the U.S. Postal Service;  is comprised of two parallel rollers with gripping surfaces in which the rollers are pushed toward each other. When the end-effector comes into contact with any portion of the deformable object;  the rollers turn inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between the rollers. The rollers stop rotating when a graspable portion of the material/object is caught in between;  allowing the object to be maneuvered by the robot. The object is released when the rollers turn outwardly. The end-effector described in this article can grab and hold filled sacks from any point on the sack;  regardless of the sack's orientation. Experimental evaluation of the end-effector has proven the design and implementation remarkably effective. This article describes the hardware;  control method;  and design issues associated with the end-effector.
