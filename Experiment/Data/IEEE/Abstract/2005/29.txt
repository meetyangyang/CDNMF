A new method for repositioning a rigid body with a flexible sheet is developed and is applied to a rehabilitation bed for turning and transferring a bedridden patient to alleviate bedsores and other ailments. The patient position and orientation are fully controlled by manipulating a flexible bed sheet under no-slip conditions. The use of a flexible sheet and the untethered nature of manipulation make the repositioning method particularly well suited to handling the human body. First;  the basic design concept of the rehabilitation bed for automated patient repositioning is presented. The kinematic and static behaviors of body-sheet interactions are analyzed;  and conditions for no-slip;  quasi-static repositioning are obtained. In order to prevent injury to the patient's fragile skin;  it must be ensured that the patient does not slip on the sheet during repositioning. A prototype bed with a pair of servoed arms for manipulating the bed sheet is developed;  and the no-slip conditions and the repositioning method are experimentally verified. A closed-loop control based on the measurement of a patient's position and orientation is implemented and tested.
