This paper presents an integrated approach to design an assembly;  fixture schemes;  and an assembly sequence;  such that the dimensional integrity of the assembly is insensitive to the dimensional variations of individual parts. The adjustability of critical dimensions and the proper constraining of parts during assembly process are the keys in achieving the dimensional integrity of the final assembly. A top-down design method is developed which recursively decomposes a lump of initial product geometry and fixture elements matching critical dimensions into parts and fixtures. At each recursion;  joints are assigned to the interfaces between two subassemblies to ensure that parts and fixtures are properly constrained at every assembly step. A case study on a simple frame structure is presented to demonstrate the method.
