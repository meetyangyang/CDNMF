In this paper;  a noble variable remote center compliance (VRCC) is developed. The VRCC has a simple structure to change the position of compliance center and to lock the VRCC. The VRCC consists of a top plate;  a bottom plate and two modified elastomer shear pads (ESP). The modified ESP has a hole in its stiffness axis;  and a stiffness adjusting rod (SAR) is inserted into the hole of the ESP. The stiffness of the modified ESP can be adjusted according to the insertion depth of the SAR so that the compliance center of the VRCC;  which depends on the stiffness of the ESP;  can be adjusted freely. Furthermore;  by passing the SAR through the modified ESP;  the VRCC can be locked easily. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed VRCC;  a prototype VRCC is made and the variation of the compliance center is measured according to the insertion depth of the SAR.
