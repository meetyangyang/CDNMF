Batch deterministic and stochastic Petri nets are introduced as a tool for modeling and performance evaluation of supply chains. The new model is developed by enhancing deterministic and stochastic Petri nets (DSPNs) with batch places and batch tokens. By incorporating stochastic Petri nets (SPNs) with the batch features;  inhibitor arcs;  and marking-dependent weights;  operational policies of supply chains such as inventory policies can be easily described in the model. Methods for structural and performance analysis of the model are developed by extending existing ones for DSPNs. As applications;  an inventory system and an industrial supply chain are modeled and their performances are evaluated analytically and by simulation;  respectively;  using this BSPN model. The applications demonstrate that our model and associated methods can solve some important supply chain modeling and analysis issues.
