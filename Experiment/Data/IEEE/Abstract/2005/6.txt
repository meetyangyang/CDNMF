An artificial-intelligence approach is proposed to differentiate various biomedical samples via Raman spectroscopy technology to obtain accurate medical diagnosis and decision making. The complete process consists of noise filtering;  fluorescence identification;  optimization and elimination;  spectral normalization;  multivariate statistical analysis;  and data clustering;  as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling;  intelligent control;  and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control;  genetic algorithms;  and principal component analysis (PCA);  as well as system identification;  a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated;  which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples.
