The factors that generally affect the slicing error in layered manufacturing (LM) processes are first analyzed;  and issues pertaining to the current methods to deal with the slicing error are discussed in this paper. A method based on a recently developed and implemented orthogonal LM system to reduce the overall slicing error is presented. In this method;  the flat region is separated from the stereolithography (STL) model and different processing methods are applied to the different areas in the part geometry. In addition;  the mathematical model for calculating the slicing error is derived and an approach based on a genetic algorithm has been developed to optimize the build orientation in terms of minimizing the slicing error. Case studies are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.
