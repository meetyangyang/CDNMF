Based on closed kinematic chains;  parallel robots obtain favorable dynamic properties as well as high stiffness. Hence;  their application can significantly enlarge the productivity of automated production processes. A control concept for tapping the high potential concerning low cycle times and high path-tracking accuracy is presented. The proposed approach adapts autonomously to changing dynamic parameters as varying payload. The autonomous behavior is achieved by combining an adaptive control approach with an adaptive;  time-optimal trajectory planning concept and an online-trajectory adaption mechanism. Extensive experimental results prove the performance of the proposed approach.
