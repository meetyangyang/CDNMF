Any assembly system-design problem which consists of generating system configurations and assignment of tasks to the stations has a set of solutions. The number of feasible solutions may be staggering;  even for products consisting of a relatively small number of parts assembled on a small number of stations. As the size of the product and the assembly system grow;  it may become difficult to develop a complete set of design solutions for in-depth analysis. Here an automated method is described by which the complete sets of system configurations and assembly sequences may be generated;  and feasible solutions;  consisting of a matched element from each set;  can be rapidly derived. These solutions may then be tested for various performance metrics;  some of which may not be expressed mathematically.
