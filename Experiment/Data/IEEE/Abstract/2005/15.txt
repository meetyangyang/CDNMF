Overhaul and repair services are important segments of the remanufacturing industry;  and are characterized by complicated disassembly;  repair and assembly process plans;  stochastic operations;  and the usage of rotable inventory. In view of today's time-based competition;  effectively scheduling such services and managing rotable inventory and uncertainties are becoming imperative to achieve on-time deliveries and low overall costs. In this paper;  a novel formulation for overhaul and repair services is presented where key characteristics;  such as uncertain asset arrivals and operation processing times;  and rotable parts are abstracted to model an overhaul center and multiple repair shops in a distributed framework to reflect organizational structures. Interactions between the overhaul center and repair shops are described by sets of coupling constraints across the organizations. Rotable inventory dynamics is formulated in terms of repair operation completion times and asset assembly beginning times to facilitate minimization of inventory holding costs through scheduling. A solution methodology combining Lagrangian relaxation;  stochastic dynamic programming;  and heuristics is developed to schedule operations in a coordinated manner to minimize total tardiness;  earliness;  and inventory holding costs. Additionally;  penalty terms associated with coupling constraint violations are introduced to the objective function to improve algorithm convergence and schedule quality;  and a surrogate optimization framework is used to overcome the inseparability difficulty caused by the penalty terms. Numerical testing results show that the new approach is computationally effective to handle rotable inventory and uncertainties;  and provides high quality schedules with low overall costs for stochastic remanufacturing systems.
