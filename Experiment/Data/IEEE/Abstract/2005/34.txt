In this paper;  a generic model for the synthesis of tolerances for manufactured parts is presented. The model uses a method of transforming traditional tolerance specifications (as defined in ASME Y14.5M) to a generalized coordinate system (hereinafter referred to as deviation space). Small displacement torsors (SDTs) have been used for representing the deviations. The tolerance synthesis method is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization process. Three different types of constraints have been considered for the optimization process: 1) representation of assemblability; 2) mapping of tolerance specification to deviations; and 3) functional requirements. A new deviation-based cost of manufacturing model has been proposed. A working module of the scheme has been implemented and the process has been elaborated with two examples. The possibility of extension of the model and scope for further generalization have been discussed.
