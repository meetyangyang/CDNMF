Resource planning for a complex remanufacturing system is in general extremely difficult in terms of;  e.g.;  problem size and uncertainties. In many cases;  simulation is the only way to select a good plan among a great number of candidates. When there exist complicated constraints;  direct selection could be very inefficient since many candidates may not be feasible but cannot be excluded beforehand. To meet the challenge;  a machine learning method is introduced in this paper to perform feasibility analysis. The rough set theory is first applied to establish the relationship between a plan and its feasibility and an iterative reinforcement process is applied to enhance confidence. The numerical testing results show that this method is promising and scalable for the large-scale problems. The research lays a basis for developing an efficient simulation-based optimization method with complicated constraints.
