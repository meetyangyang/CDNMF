Circuit board assembly is mostly done in conveyorized flow lines in which each board visits each machine in a fixed sequence. It is common knowledge that balanced flow lines provide high throughput and low cost in high volume and low mix manufacturing. However;  in flow lines;  a single machine interruption stops the entire line when the buffer capacity is low. As a result;  the throughput of circuit board assembly lines is often much lower than bottleneck machine throughput capacity. Lines with parallel machines can potentially reduce the effect of individual machine interruptions. This research is to quantify the throughput gain of parallel segments with analytical models. Simulation and a case study were also conducted to compare with the analytical results.
