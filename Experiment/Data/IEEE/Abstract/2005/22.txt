We have developed a novel device to supply hydraulic power for anaerobic mobile robotic systems. This power source demonstrates the possibility of operation in oxygen-free environments;  such as underwater or in space. Unlike the internal combustion engine;  the design produces power on demand;  eliminating idling when there is no load on the system. This monopropellant-powered free piston hydraulic pump (FPHP) was designed as a human scale (1.0-3.0 kW) power source;  and produces only steam and oxygen as its byproducts. The FPHP utilizes high concentration hydrogen peroxide as the monopropellant energy source;  which decomposes into hot gas when exposed to a catalyst. Energy is extracted from the hydrogen peroxide and transferred directly to hydraulic fluid by expanding the hot decomposition gas in an integrated piston/cylinder arrangement. Based on a specific power and specific energy analysis using a Ragone plot;  the performance of the FPHP potentially exceeds that of a battery-based hydraulic power source for short operation times.
