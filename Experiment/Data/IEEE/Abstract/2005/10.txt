We study supervisory control of discrete event systems with potentially infinite state-space using state variables for representation and specification. An assignment program model consisting of state variables and a finite set of conditional assignment statements is used for representing a discrete event system;  and a predicate over state variables is used for representing a state avoidance control specification. The contribution of this paper is to show how to perform supervisory control computations symbolically. In the case of a Petri net (vector addition system) with the set of forbidden states being a right-closed set;  we present a finitely terminating algorithm for maximally permissive supervision.
