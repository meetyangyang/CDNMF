This paper presents a new extension to ordinary Petri nets (PNs) that uses complex-valued tokens. By allowing two kinds of tokens;  \real\ and \imaginary; \ each place marking contains both quantity and type information. Complex-valued token PNs were designed to integrate seamlessly with other popular Petri net extensions such as timed nets;  stochastic nets;  and colored nets. This simple and intuitive application of complex numbers and complex arithmetic to PNs provides a unique modeling tool. Some examples show the capabilities of this proposed class of PNs.
