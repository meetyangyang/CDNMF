We propose a work-in-process (WIP) estimation flow control method which serves as a countermeasure against the throughput degradation problem caused by the redundant blocking time of conventional flow control. This method is based on a scheduling technique of which the most important features are: 1) breaking down the entire schedule into individual lot schedules; 2) lot scheduling to reduce redundant blocking time; and 3) WIP estimation for contiguous finite buffer scheduling. The method;  first;  schedules operational lots at each equipment unit in a fabrication line by using our scheduling procedure for contiguous finite buffers to satisfy the limit capacity of the buffers. Next;  the method estimates the future WIP at each equipment group based on predetermined schedules for performing operations. Finally;  the method improves the operation timings by continuously supplying WIP estimation to the scheduling procedure. In an actual liquid crystal display (LCD) fabrication line simulation;  we have confirmed that the proposed WIP estimation method is a promising one from the standpoint of the line throughput which we obtained.
