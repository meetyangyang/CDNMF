This paper addresses the problem of determining the instantaneous state of mobility and constraint of a general mechanism or assembly using screw theory. This problem has been attacked before by different methods with varying success. The method presented here is very simple and applies to many types of mechanisms;  with one interesting exception. This exception also eludes the Griibler/Kutzbach criterion. The method presented here also improves the accuracy and scope of a method presented by Konkar and Cutkosky.
