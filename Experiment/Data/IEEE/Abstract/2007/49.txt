Approximate closed form expressions for the mean cycle time in a G/G/m-queue often serve as practical and intuitive alternatives to more exact but less tractable analyses. However;  the G/G/m-queue model may not fully address issues that arise in practical manufacturing systems. Such issues include tools with production parallelism;  tools that are idle with work in process;  travel to the queue;  and the tendency of lots to defect from a failed server and return to the queue even after they have entered production. In this paper;  we extend popular approximate mean cycle time formulae to address these practical manufacturing issues. Employing automated data extraction algorithms embedded in software;  we test the approximations using parameters gleaned from production tool groups in IBM's 200 mm semiconductor wafer fabricator.
