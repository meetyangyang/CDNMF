This paper describes a modeling language that aims to provide a unified framework for representing control systems;  namely;  physical plants coupled with computer-based control devices. The proposed modeling methodology is based on the cardinal principle of object orientation;  which allows describing both control software and physical components using the same basic concepts;  particularly those of capsules;  ports;  and protocols. Furthermore;  it is illustrated how the well-known object-oriented specification language unified modeling language can be adopted;  provided an adequate formalization of its semantics;  to describe structural and behavioral aspects of control systems;  related to both logical and physical parts.
