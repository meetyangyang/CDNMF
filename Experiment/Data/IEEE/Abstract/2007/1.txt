In recent years;  rapid tooling (RT) has become increasingly important because of the requirement of rapid manufacturing. RT can be used to produce temporary molds as well as permanent molds in mass production. RT provides more benefits from the design stage to mass production. The objective of this research is to develop the direct metallic RT system and identify process parameters of laser cladding. A 2.5-kW Nd-AG laser system;  a metallic powder feeder system;  a lateral powder nozzle system;  a PC-based motion controller;  and a shielding gas-supply system are incorporated for the hardware architecture in the proposed RT system. The critical process parameters influencing the dimensional accuracy were analyzed with Taguchi's experimental design. From the analysis of variance computational results;  the factors \Scanning speed\ and \Tool path offset\ are the influential factors affecting the layer thickness of RT parts. From the experimental results;  the dimensional accuracy of the dual nozzle RT system is better than the single-nozzle RT system. Finally;  the proposed RT system could fabricate the mold inserts. After finishing the mold inserts and assembling the plenary injection mold;  the injection molding machine can generate acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic parts with excellent quality.
