<para xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> A new cooling system for a fleet of scientific instruments in the form of miniature wireless robots designed for interactions at the nanometer-scale is assessed to determine its limitations. Unlike other approaches;  the use of a cooling chamber allows us to remove an embedded cooling system and maintain the overall size of each robot to a minimum;  hence increasing the density of instruments per surface area and resulting in enhanced performance of the platform. The goal of this paper is to assess the capacity of this cooling system; not only to remove heat but also to reduce temperature fluctuations and difference in temperature levels among the robots to maintain each robot within an operational temperature range of 0–70 <formula formulatype=\inline\> <tex>$^{\\circ}{\\rm C}$</tex></formula>. One hundred dummy robots were therefore placed in a custom-built cooling chamber which uses forced air convection. The temperature levels of the dummy robots were recorded with power dissipations from 0 to 15 W/robot and a maximum air flow rate of 0.5 m/s. It was determined that the maximum range in difference in temperature levels among the dummy robots increases by <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$\\sim{\\hbox {20}}\\;^{\\circ}$</tex> </formula>C per additional 5 W/robot of power dissipation with an initial difference of <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$\\sim{\\hbox {40}}\\;^{\\circ}$</tex> </formula>C at 5 W/robot. An estimated total power dissipation of 10 W/robot was determined to be a safe limit in order to maintain the operating temperature range of the robots between 0–70 <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$^{\\circ}$</tex> </formula>C. For power dissipation over 10 W/robot;  additional compensation methods are required. </para>.
