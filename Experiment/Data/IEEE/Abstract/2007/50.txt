We present an analytical approach for estimating the expected time for an automated material handling system (AMHS) to respond to move requests at loading stations in a vehicle-based;  unidirectional;  closed-loop AMHS. The expected response times are important for estimating the expected work-in-process (WIP) levels at the loading stations for design purposes;  and for evaluating the performance of the AMHS as delayed response can impact the production cycle times. The expected response time approximation is validated by comparing the analytical model to the simulation results using a SEMATECH 300 mm hypothetical fab data set.
