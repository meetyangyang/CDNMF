<para xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> An automated biological fluid dispensing system for microarray fabrication using inkjet technology is presented in this paper. The hardware of the system consists of a high-precision motion system;  a robotic material handling system;  computer control systems;  and extensive vision systems. The system software includes algorithms to handle control;  communication;  and manufacturing process information. This fluid dispensing system has been successfully used to produce cDNA microarrays and in the investigation of protein microarray manufacturing. </para>.
