This paper studies online fault detection and isolation of modular dynamic systems modeled as sets of place-bordered Petri nets. The common places among the set of Petri nets modeling a system capture coupling of various system components. The transitions are labeled by events;  some of which are unobservable (i.e.;  not directly recorded by the sensors attached to the system). The events whose occurrence must be diagnosed have unobservable transition labels. These events model faults or other significant changes in the system state. The existing theory of diagnosis of discrete-event systems is extended in the context of the above model. The modular structure of the system is exploited by a distributed algorithm for fault diagnosis. A Petri net diagnoser is associated with every Petri net and the diagnosers communicate in real time during the diagnostic process when the token count of common places changes. A merge function is defined to combine the individual diagnoser states and recover the complete diagnoser state that would be obtained under a monolithic approach. Strategies that reduce the communication overhead are presented. The software implementation of the distributed algorithm is discussed.
