In this paper;  we analyze and compare the performance of the vertical and the horizontal automated-guided-vehicle transportation systems. We use results in queuing network theory and a transportation simulator to design a hybrid strategy for this study;  and to set the appropriate number of agents in the systems. Next;  these two transportation systems are evaluated based on cost-effectiveness criteria. For this purpose;  the total construction costs of the systems for the various transportation demands are compared. Finally;  we provide analytical results to evaluate and to obtain the most efficient system;  based on the validity of each system;  under different demand scenario.
