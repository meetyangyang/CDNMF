Disassembly plays a key role in a life-cycle-based economy since it enables the recovery of resources in product and material cycles. In order to set up future disassembly plants;  various problems have to be solved in advance. This includes varying quantities as well as a wide range of product types and states. A partly automated disassembly system could adapt to a large variety of products and different degrees of devaluation. Differences between a given disassembly plan and the actual situation at the shop floor require a highly flexible control system. High flexibility can be achieved by rapid rearrangement of transport processes and disassembly operations based on the actual system conditions in relation to requested disassembly tasks. This requires an adaptive control based on modules. Additionally;  the ability to exchange control modules;  variables;  and parameters online will be required. Consequently;  at the device level;  robots have to be adaptive to new requirements in cooperation with the cell controller. Modularized program blocks and online exchanges are also required for the robot controller. </para>.
