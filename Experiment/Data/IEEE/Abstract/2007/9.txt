An analogy between an agent (e.g.;  an autonomous vehicle) and a biological forager is extended to a social environment by viewing a communication network as implementing interagent sociality. We first describe engineering design within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework. We then explain why sociality may emerge in some environments and for some agent objectives. Next;  we derive the evolutionarily stable design strategy for an agent manufacturer: 1) choosing whether the agent it produces should cooperate with other agents in a search problem and 2) choosing the group size of a multiagent system tasked with a cooperative search problem. We show the impact of \agent relatedness; \ a measure of common descent between two agents based on their underlying manufacturers;  on the choices in scenarios 1) and 2). Our predictions are evaluated in an autonomous vehicle simulation testbed. The results illustrate a new methodology for manufacturers to make robust;  optimal choices for multiagent system design for a given set of objectives and domain of operation.
