A crucial step in the logic-control design for flexible manufacturing systems is the modeling of the desired behavior in terms of production sequences. These are typically expressed as a series of informal specifications which are to be translated into a formal model. The present paper introduces a Petri net-based methodology for the modeling of production sequences conceived as an incremental process;  which progressively adds subnets to a partial model until all specifications have been included. A formal verification of the model is performed at every stage;  so that specifications;  which are incongruent with the current model and can jeopardize its correctness;  can be detected and rejected or modified. No unnecessary modeling constraints are imposed on the model class and behaviors characterized by complex alternative-parallel relationships between operations can be represented. A specific algorithm is provided for the automatic synthesis of complex connection structures in the model;  allowing for greater flexibility and complexity in the design process.
