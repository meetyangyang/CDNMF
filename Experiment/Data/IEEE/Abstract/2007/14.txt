The diagnosis of discrete event systems is strongly related to events estimation. This paper focuses on faulty behaviors modeled with ordinary Petri nets with some \fault\ transitions. Partial but unbiased measurement of the places marking variation is used in order to estimate the firing sequences. The main contribution is to decide which sets of places must be observed for the exact estimation of some given firing sequences. Minimal diagnosers are defined that detect and isolate the firing of fault transitions immediately. Causality relationships and directed paths are also investigated to characterize the influence and dependence areas of the fault transitions. Delayed diagnosers are obtained as a consequence.
