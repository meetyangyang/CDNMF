The contribution of this paper is the introduction of the event-condition-action (ECA) paradigm for the design of modular logic controllers that are reconfigurable. ECA rules have been used extensively to specify the behavior of active database and expert systems and are recognized as a highly reconfigurable tool to design reactive behavior. This paper develops a method to design modular logic controllers whose dynamics are governed by ECA rules;  with the ultimate goal of producing reconfigurable control. Modularity;  integrability;  and diagnosability measures that have in the past been used to measure the reconfigurability of manufacturing systems are used to assess the reconfigurability of the developed controllers. For the modularity measure;  criteria found in computer science to evaluate the modularity of object-oriented programs are adapted to evaluate the modularity of modular logic controllers. The results of this paper are that reconfigurability is highly dependent on the level of modularity of the logic control system;  and that not all \modular\ structures are reconfigurable. There are approaches;  such as the one shown in this paper using ECA rules;  that can greatly increase the modularity;  integrability;  and diagnosability of the logic control system;  thus increasing its reconfigurability.
