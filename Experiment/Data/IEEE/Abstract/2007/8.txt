Manufacturing system design has an impact on product quality. In this paper;  we investigate this impact through an application study at an automotive paint shop. Specifically;  for repair and rework systems in paint operations;  we develop a model to quantify paint quality [in terms of quality buy rate (QBR)] as a function of repair capacity. We show that the QBR can be improved and unnecessary repaints can be reduced by increasing the repair capacity.
