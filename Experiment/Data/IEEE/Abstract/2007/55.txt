In a semiconductor manufacturing system;  particular human operations may violate desired requirements and lead to destructive failure. For such human-in-the-loop systems;  this paper proposes a supervisory framework which guarantees that manual operations meet required specifications so as to prevent human errors in operation using Petri nets. Moreover;  a modular technique with an intersection mechanism is proposed in order to cope with the state-space explosion problem of large-scale systems. A rapid thermal process in semiconductor manufacturing systems is provided to show the practicability of the proposed approach.
