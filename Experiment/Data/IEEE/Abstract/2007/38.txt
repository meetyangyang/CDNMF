That is;  the manufacturer will get paid for stopping production to save on electricity. The amount rewarded in a period will depend on the electricity market condition at that time. The market condition in any given period is represented by <formula formulatype=\inline\> <tex>$M+1$</tex></formula> states: normal (i.e.;  nonpeak);  peak type <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$1;  \\ldots$</tex></formula>;  peak type <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$M$</tex></formula>;  and the reward amount in the period will be <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$0; $</tex></formula> <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$K_1;  \\ldots$</tex></formula>;  and <formula formulatype=\inline\> <tex>$K_M$</tex></formula>;  respectively. The occurrence of each state in a period is dictated by a known probability distribution. The objective is to determine from the manufacturer's perspective;  whether to take such an offer when it arises. Under a mild assumption;  we show that in the normal market condition;  the production decision is partly a base-stock policy;  whereas under peak type <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$m$</tex></formula> condition;  the manufacturer;  upon accepting the offer;  produces according to an <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$(s_m;  S)$</tex></formula> policy;  where <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex>$m=1;  \\ldots;  M$</tex></formula>. The numerical experiment demonstrates that the cost savings due to buy-backs can be substantial. It also shows that the always-participating strategy (i.e.;  the firm shuts down production whenever the buy–back program is activated) can perform much worse than the never-participating strategy. </para>.
