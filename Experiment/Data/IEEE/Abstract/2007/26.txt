In this paper;  we develop a framework to classify supply chain risk-management problems and approaches for the solution of these problems. We argue that risk-management problems need to be handled at three levels: 1) strategic;  2) operational;  and 3) tactical. In addition;  risk within the supply chain might manifest itself in the form of deviations;  disruptions;  and disasters. To handle unforeseen events in the supply chain;  there are two obvious approaches: 1) to design chains with built-in risk tolerance and 2) to contain the damage once the undesirable event has occurred. Both of these approaches require a clear understanding of undesirable events that may take place in the supply chain and the associated consequences and impacts from these events. Having described these approaches;  we then focus our efforts on mapping out the propagation of events in the supply chain due to supplier nonperformance;  and employ our insight to develop two mathematical programming-based preventive models for strategic level deviation and disruption management. The first model;  a simple integer quadratic optimization model;  adapted from the Markowitz model;  determines optimal partner selection with the objective of minimizing both the operational cost and the variability of total operational cost. The second model;  a simple mixed integer programming optimization model;  adapted from the credit risk minimization model;  determines optimal partner selection such that the supply shortfall is minimized even in the face of supplier disruptions. Hence;  both of these models offer possible approaches to robust supply chain design.
