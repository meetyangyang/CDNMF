Packing two-dimensional shapes on a surface such that no shapes overlap and the uncovered surface area is minimized is an important problem that arises in a variety of industrial applications. This paper introduces an intelligent system which tackles the most difficult instance of this problem;  where two-dimensional irregular shapes have to be packed on a regularly or irregularly shaped surface. The proposed system utilizes techniques not previously applied to packing;  drawn from computer vision and artificial intelligence;  and achieves high-quality solutions with short computational times. In addition;  the system deals with complex shapes and constraints that occur in industrial applications;  such as defective regions and irregularly shaped sheets. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method using 14 established benchmark problems that are available from the EURO Special Interest Group on Cutting and Packing.
