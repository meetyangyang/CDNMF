This paper extends our prior result on decidability of bisimulation equivalence control from the setting of complete observations to that of partial observations. Besides being control compatible;  the supervisor must now also be observation compatible. We show that the \small model theorem\ remains valid by showing that a control and observation compatible supervisor exists if and only if it exists over a certain finite state space;  namely the power set of the Cartesian product of the system and the specification state spaces.
