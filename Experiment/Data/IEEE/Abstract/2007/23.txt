Although several hybrid shop floor control architectures have been proposed in the literature;  varying degrees of autonomy of subordinate controllers and their effects on supervisory level performance have not been studied. In this paper;  we present a new hybrid control architecture with two levels;  where the autonomy of subordinate agents changes adaptively. The penalty function in the architecture represents the degree of negative impact on performance that will result from changing the original schedule. When a disturbance occurs;  the disturbance agent invokes rescheduling at the appropriate level depending on the threshold disturbance level. The subordinate agents execute tasks based on the schedule from the supervisory agent in the absence of disturbances; or else revise the original schedule optimally with regard to the supervisory level performance (via penalty function) and the disturbance before executing the tasks. We present math programming formulations;  quantitative metrics to indicate the disturbance level and the levels of autonomy. The proposed architecture is illustrated using a job shop problem and is then tested with various other problems.
