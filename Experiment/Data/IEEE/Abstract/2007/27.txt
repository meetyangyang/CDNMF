An efficient approach for 2-D sheet part nesting;  incorporating a novel space encoding scheme and a greedy method for placing parts;  is presented. The space encoding scheme denotes the occupancy of the part and the vacancy of the material sheet by discrete strip segments with an equal width and utilizes real-number coordinates on each segment for representing the occupancy and the vacancy. The greedy method operates in an iterative fashion by generating a part sequence and searching for the best position and orientation of each part in the part sequence. The part sequences are generated by a genetic algorithm with appropriate operators. The searching;  based on bound settings;  results in a stable searching process that is independent of the number of the parts involved. Experimental results show that the approach proposed is able to operate in an efficient manner and the final placements for the parts are more economical in comparison with a benchmark. The greedy method is particularly efficient in cases containing parts with multiple pieces because the range of the bounds for searching is gradually reduced as the method progresses.
