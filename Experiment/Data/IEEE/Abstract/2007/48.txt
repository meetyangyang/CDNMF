This paper surveys applications of queueing theory for semiconductor manufacturing systems (SMSs). Due to sophisticated tool specifications and process flows in semiconductor manufacturing;  queueing models can be very complicated. Research efforts have been on the improvement of model assumptions and model input;  mainly in the first moment (averages) and the second moment (variations). However;  practices show that implementation of classical queueing theory in semiconductor industry has been unsatisfactory. In this paper;  open problems on queueing modeling of SMS are discussed. A potential solution is also proposed by relaxing the independent assumptions in the classical queueing theory. Cycle time reduction has constantly been a key focus of semiconductor manufacturing. Compared with simulation;  queueing theory-based analytical modeling is much faster in estimating manufacturing system performance and providing more insights for performance improvement. Therefore;  queueing modeling attracts generous semiconductor research grants. Unfortunately;  existing queueing models focus on simple extensions of the classical queueing theory and fail to question its applicability to the complicated SMS. Hence;  related researches have not been employed widely in the semiconductor industry. In this paper;  we conduct a survey on the important works and also present some open problems. We also propose a novel solution by relaxing a key assumption in the classical queueing theory. We are currently funded by Intel to explore this potential solution;  and we hope it can foster an interesting research field for the years to come.
