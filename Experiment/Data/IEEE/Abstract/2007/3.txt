In this paper;  a new approach is proposed using the 3-D thermal energy distribution of the workpiece. The new approach is based on the fact that during the stamping process;  the workpiece absorbs energy to deform. This mechanical energy is converted into thermal energy. Therefore;  it is possible to diagnose the stamping by analyzing the 3-D thermal energy distribution. In practice;  the thermal energy distribution can be acquired using an infrared camera. However;  it is often necessary to reconstruct the 3-D thermal energy distribution;  which can be accomplished by using the Octree algorithm. On the other hand;  one can compute the thermal energy distribution through finite-element modeling (FEM) as the baseline for diagnosis. Then;  by comparison;  the diagnosis can be carried out. A couple of examples are presented in detail together with the experiment validation.
