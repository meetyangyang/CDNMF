Color information is useful in vision-based feature detection;  particularly for food processing applications where color variability often renders grayscale-based machine-vision algorithms that are difficult or impossible to work with. This paper presents a color machine vision algorithm that consists of two components. The first creates an artificial color contrast as a prefilter that aims at highlighting the target while suppressing its surroundings. The second;  referred to here as the statistically based fast bounded box (SFBB);  utilizes the principal component analysis technique to characterize target features in color space from a set of training data so that the color classification can be performed accurately and efficiently. We evaluate the algorithm in the context of food processing applications and examine the effects of the color characterization on computational efficiency by comparing the proposed solution against two commonly used color classification algorithms; a neural-network classifier and the support vector machine. Comparison among the three methods demonstrates that statistically based fast bounded box is relatively easy to train;  efficient;  and effective since with sufficient training data;  it does not require any additional optimization steps; these advantages make SFBB an ideal candidate for high-speed automation involving live and/or natural objects.
