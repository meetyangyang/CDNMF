This paper addresses the problem of volume parameterization that serves as the geometric kernel for design automation of customized free-form products. The purpose of volume parameterization is to establish a mapping between the spaces that are near to two reference free-form models;  so that the shape of a product presented in free-form surfaces can be transferred from the space around one reference model to another reference model. The mapping is expected to keep the spatial relationship between the product model and reference models as much as possible. We separate the mapping into rigid body transformation and elastic warping. The rigid body transformation is determined by anchor points defined on the reference models using a least-squares fitting approach. The elastic warping function is more difficult to obtain;  especially when the meshes of the reference objects are inconsistent. A three-stage approach is conducted. First;  a coarse-level warping function is computed based on the anchor points. In the second phase;  the topology consistency is maintained through a surface fitting process. Finally;  the mapping of volume parameterization is established on the surface fitting result. Compared to previous methods;  the approach presented here is more efficient. Also;  benefitting from the separation of rigid body transformation and elastic warping;  the transient shape of a transferred product does not give unexpected distortion. At the end of this paper;  various industry applications of our approach in design automation are demonstrated.
