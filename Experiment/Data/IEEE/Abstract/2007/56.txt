Multiproject wafer (MPW) production cost is sensitive to how the chips are arranged in a reticle. In this paper;  we propose a methodology for exploring the reticle floorplan design space to minimize MPW production cost. Experimental results show that our methodology often achieves double-digit cost savings. A study using MPW for volume production shows that the volume cutoff points range from a few thousand dice to tens of thousands of dice.
