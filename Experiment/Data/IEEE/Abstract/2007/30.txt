This paper surveys recent research and current art in the area of auction-based mechanisms for e-procurement. The survey delineates different representative scenarios in e-procurement where auctions can be deployed and describes the conceptual and mathematical aspects of different categories of procurement auctions. We discuss three broad categories: 1) single-item auctions: auctions for procuring a single unit or multiple units of a single homogeneous type of item; 2) multi-item auctions: auctions for procuring a single unit or multiple units of multiple items; and 3) multiattribute auctions where the procurement decisions are based not only on costs but also on attributes;  such as lead times;  maintenance contracts;  quality;  etc. In our review;  we present the mathematical formulations under each of the above categories;  bring out the game theoretic and computational issues involved in solving the problems;  and summarize the current art. We also present a significant case study of auction based e-procurement at General Motors. </para>.
