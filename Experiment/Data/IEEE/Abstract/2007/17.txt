Recently;  the modeling of variation propagation in complex multistage manufacturing processes has drawn significant attention. In this paper;  a linear model is developed to describe the dimensional variation propagation of machining processes through kinematic analysis of the relationships among fixture error;  datum error;  machine geometric error;  and the dimensional quality of the product. The developed modeling technique can handle general fixture layouts rather than being limited to a 3-2-1 layout case. The dimensional error accumulation and transformation within the multistage process are quantitatively described in this model. A systematic procedure to build the model is presented and validated. This model has great potential to be applied toward fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complex machining processes.
