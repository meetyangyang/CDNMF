Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is currently used in many inspection applications;  such as the inspection of nonaccessible pipe surfaces. This human-oriented approach based on offline analysis of the raw images is highly subjective and prone to error because of the exorbitant amount of data to be assessed. Laser profilers have been recently proposed to project well-defined light patterns;  improving the illumination of standard CCTV systems as well as enhancing the capability of automating the assessment process. This research shows that positional (geometrical) as well as intensity information;  related to potential defects;  can be extracted from the acquired laser projections. While most researchers focus on the analysis of positional information obtained from the acquired profiler signals;  here the intensity information contained within the reflected light is also exploited for the purpose of defect classification and visualization. This paper describes novel strategies created for the automation of defect classification in tubular structures and explores new methods to fuse intensity and positional information;  achieving improved multivariable defect classification. The acquired camera/laser images are processed in order to extract signal information for the purpose of visualization and map creation for further assessment. Then;  a two-stage approach based on image processing and artificial neural networks is used to classify the images. First;  a binary classifier identifies defective pipe sections;  and then in a second stage;  the defects are classified into different types;  such as holes;  cracks;  and protruding obstacles. Experimental results are provided.
