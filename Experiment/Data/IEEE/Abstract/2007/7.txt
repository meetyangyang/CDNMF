In this paper;  we exploit the idea of decomposition to match buyers and sellers in an electronic exchange for trading large volumes of homogeneous goods;  where the buyers and sellers specify marginal-decreasing piecewise constant price curves to capture volume discounts. Such exchanges are relevant for automated trading in many e-business applications. The problem of determining winners and Vickrey prices in such exchanges is known to have a worst-case complexity equal to that of as many as (1+m+n) NP-hard problems;  where m is the number of buyers and n is the number of sellers. Our method proposes the overall exchange problem to be solved as two separate and simpler problems: 1) forward auction and 2) reverse auction;  which turns out to be generalized knapsack problems. In the proposed approach;  we first determine the quantity of units to be traded between the sellers and the buyers using fast heuristics developed by us. Next;  we solve a forward auction and a reverse auction using fully polynomial time approximation schemes available in the literature. The proposed approach has worst-case polynomial time complexity and our experimentation shows that the approach produces good quality solutions to the problem.
