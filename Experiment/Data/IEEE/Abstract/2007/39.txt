This paper considers the problem of coordinating the production and distribution activities of a network of independent supply centers. In particular;  we focus on the supply of rapidly perishable goods (ready-mixed concrete) that must be delivered to customers in strict time windows. The problem presents three main challenges. First;  it includes several interrelated scheduling and routing problems;  each affected by nearly prohibitive combinatorial complexity. Second;  due to the perishable nature of the supplied products;  effective solutions must not only optimize the objective function related to resource utilization and cost minimization;  but also tolerate the small and frequent stochastic perturbations (transport delays) of the operating environment. Third;  if major perturbations occur;  the decision strategy must be able to respond in real time with effective rescheduling interventions restoring the indispensable synchronization of activities in progress;  and avoiding extremely undesirable circumstances related to product decay. After providing a detailed mathematical model of the considered problem;  this paper proposes a hybrid metaheuristic approach integrating a genetic algorithm with a number of problem-specific constructive heuristics. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated against other scheduling heuristics on an industrial case study.
