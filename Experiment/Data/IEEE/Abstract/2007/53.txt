In semiconductor assembly and test manufacturing (ATM);  a station normally consists of multiple machines (maybe of different types) for a certain operation step. It is critical to optimize the utilization of ATM stations for productivity improvement. In this paper;  we first formulate the bottleneck station scheduling problem;  and then apply ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve it metaheuristically. The ACO is a biological-inspired optimization mechanism. It incorporates each ant agent's feedback information to collaboratively search for the good solutions. We develop the ACO-based scheduling framework and provide the system parameter tuning strategy. The system implementation at an Intel chipset factory demonstrates a significant machine conversion reduction comparing to a traditional scheduling approach.
