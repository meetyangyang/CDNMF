Compound priority dispatching (CPD) is a new dispatching strategy for semiconductor wafer fabrication. It takes into account both work-in-progress (WIP) management and wafer start control. The compound priority of wafers is calculated based upon fab wafer start status;  the current processing step;  and the amount of WIP in the current;  the upstream;  and the downstream steps. Simulation results demonstrate that;  for a given fab model;  CPD can reduce the mean total queue time (MTQT) by 50% and increase the throughput rate by 20% compared with first- in-first-out (FIFO) and shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) scheduling (dispatching) strategies.
