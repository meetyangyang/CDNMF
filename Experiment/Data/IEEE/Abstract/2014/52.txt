Planning problems in the operational space are characterized by implementation issues that do not occur in the joint space. For example;  depending on the manipulator pose;  relatively slow trajectories in the operational space could require unfeasible joint speeds;  thus causing the degeneration of the system performances: Path tracking errors certainly increase but;  in the worst situations;  the manipulator must be stopped in order to prevent the system instability. This paper proposes a real-time planner in the operational space that is able to generate trajectories subject to dynamic constraints and devised according to the path-velocity decomposition approach. The feasibility is achieved by means of an automatic scaling system that;  starting from a possibly unfeasible trajectory;  modifies its longitudinal velocity in order to fulfill a given set of kinematic constraints;  thus preserving an accurate path tracking. The scaling system promptly reacts to critical configurations through minimum-time transients. The proposed approach has been tested on an actual anthropomorphic manipulator by executing 6D trajectories.
