Synchronizing sequences have been proposed in the late 1960s to solve testing problems on systems modeled by finite-state machines. Such sequences lead a system;  seen as a black box;  from an unknown current state to a known final one. This paper presents a first investigation of the computation of synchronizing sequences for systems modeled by synchronized Petri nets. In the first part of the paper;  existing techniques for automata are adapted to this new setting. Later on;  new approaches;  that exploit the net structure to efficiently compute synchronizing sequences without an exhaustive enumeration of the state space;  are presented.
