This paper presents existence and uniqueness results for a propagative model of simultaneous impacts that is guaranteed to conserve energy and momentum in the case of elastic impacts with extensions to perfectly plastic and inelastic impacts. A corresponding time-stepping algorithm that guarantees conservation of continuous energy and discrete momentum is developed;  also with extensions to plastic and inelastic impacts. The model is illustrated in simulation using billiard balls and a two-dimensional legged robot as examples; the latter is optimized over geometry and gait parameters to achieve unique simultaneous impacts.
