Reliability estimation based on degradation model is a feasible and low-cost alternative used to estimate reliability for highly reliable systems when the failure-time data are rare. Based on reliability estimation by degradation modeling;  preventive maintenance work orders need to be timely triggered to minimize unscheduled downtime. In Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.;  vol. 9;  no. 1;  pp. 209â€“212;  Jan. 2012;  Sun et al.;  an approach to dynamically extract maintenance threshold is presented for maintenance scheduling;  in which the reliability threshold for maintenance is determined by maximizing the expected availability and the reliability estimation is achieved by a modified two-stage degradation modeling approach. Although this approach is novel and useful;  its reliability estimation is an asymptotic solution in long time scale. In this paper;  we generalize the above result by considering a general degradation path model and provide the exact and explicit formulation for reliability estimation. Additionally;  a maximum-likelihood estimation method for parameters in the presented model is proposed based on the historical degradation observations. Finally;  an example is provided for illustration.
