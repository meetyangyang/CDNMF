Fixtures are used in almost all modern manufacturing operations. In practice;  there is a wide range of specifications on the manufacturing precision and thus different requirements on workpiece locating accuracy during each production process. In view of that;  this paper developed a unified signed distance function framework. Under this framework;  three systems of sensitivity equations;  which link the locator source errors to the resulting workpiece localization error;  were derived. Accordingly;  unique linear;  one-sided quadratic;  and two-sided quadratic models have been developed. These three models;  distinguished by whether or not taking into account workpiece and/or locator curvature effects;  provide a range of locating precision analysis which is illustrated and verified by several examples. The developed modeling technique can handle general fixture locating rather than being limited to certain locating schemes. The proposed models are of practical relevance and have great potential to be applied towards locating scheme evaluation;  fixture design;  fault diagnosis;  and tolerance analysis.
