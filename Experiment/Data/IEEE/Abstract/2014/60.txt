This paper is devoted to modeling and analysis of multiproduct manufacturing systems with homogeneous exponential machines and finite buffers. In such systems;  each machine processes multiple product types with different speeds;  but the processing time for each product type is the same on all machines. Buffers are finite;  shared for all products. Analytical methods to evaluate the system performance are developed;  and system-theoretic properties are investigated. It is shown from numerical experiments that such a method has a high accuracy in performance evaluation. To improve the performance of such systems;  bottleneck analysis is carried out to identify the machine and/or product whose improvement will lead to the largest improvement in system throughput.
