Micro-technologies based on wirelessly powered and manoeuvred submillimeter device;  i.e.; microrobots;  are attracting growing attention. Their application in lab-on-a-chip systems;  such as micromanipulation and in vitro cell sorting;  is expected to steeply increase. However;  the actuation;  powering and control of microrobots are challenges that still need concrete solutions. Magnetic fields generally enable wireless navigation of microrobots;  but proper control architectures and magnetic navigation systems are needed;  depending on the specific task and on the level of interaction required to the user. Here we present a magnetic navigation platform intended for lab-on-a-chip applications and we address its usability with different levels of human involvement by using two control architectures: teleoperated and autonomous. We perform an experimental analysis to demonstrate that both architectures;  enrolling different levels of interaction by the user;  lead to reliable execution of the microrobotic task. First;  we validate the open-loop response of the microrobotic system;  and second;  we evaluate the performance of the system by testing both control architectures with a standard mobility task. The results show that users can teleoperate the microrobot with 100% success rate;  in 14.4±1.9s with a normalized spatial mean error of 0.60±0.13. Moreover;  results show a fast decaying learning curve for the users involved in the study. Compared to this;  when the navigation task is performed by the autonomous control;  100% success rate;  a time of 8.0±0.5s and a normalized spatial mean error of 0.50±0.05 are obtained. Finally;  we quantitatively demonstrate how both control methodologies enable very smooth movements of the microrobot;  suggesting application for any task where repeatable and dexterous movements in liquid microenvironments are key requirements.
