In this paper;  we symbolically represent timed discrete-event systems (TDES);  which can be used to efficiently compute the supervisor in the supervisory control theory context. We model a TDES based on timed extended finite automata (TEFAs): an augmentation of extended finite automata (EFAs) by incorporating discrete time into the model. EFAs are ordinary automata extended with discrete variables;  where conditional expressions and update functions can be attached to the transitions. The symbolic computations are based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs). We show how TEFAs can be represented by BDDs. The main feature of this approach is that the BDD-based fixed point computations are not based on tick models that have been commonly used in this area;  leading to better performance in many cases. The approach has been implemented and applied to a simple case study and several large-scale benchmarks.
