The problem of guaranteed cost control for a class of networked control systems possessing uncertainties;  network delays;  and packet dropouts is solved in this paper. By means of introducing an auxiliary variable;  a newly coupled;  switched system model is derived first. Then;  based on a predictive network control scheme;  the conditions for guaranteed control performance of the overall system in terms of linear matrix inequalities are given. Next;  a novel control design method;  involving convex optimization technique to find solutions for the controllers that vary according to network delays and data-dropouts;  is developed. It is shown from theory that the obtained criteria are much less conservative than existing ones. Finally;  two illustrative examples;  the second one being a laboratory-scale rig;  are elaborated on to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. Both numerical and simulation results appear favorable to this novel network control system synthesis.
