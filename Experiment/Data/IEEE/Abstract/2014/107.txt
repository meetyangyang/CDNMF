Three-dimensional (3D) body scanning technology opens opportunities for virtual try-on and automatic made-to-measure apparel design. This paper proposes a new feature-based parametric method for modeling human body shape from scanned point clouds of a 3D body scanner [TC]\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n. The human body model consists of two layers: the skeleton and the cross sections of each body part. First;  a simple skeleton model from the body scanner [TC]\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n system has been improved by adding and adjusting the position of joints in order to better address some fit issues related to body shape changes such as spinal bending. Second;  an automatic approach to extracting semantic features for cross sections has been developed based on the body hierarchy. For each cross section;  it is described by a set of key points which can be fit with a closed cardinal spline. According to the point distribution in point clouds;  an extraction method of key points on cross sections has been studied and developed. Third;  this paper presents an interpolation approach to fitting the key points on a cross section to a cardinal spline;  in which different tension parameters are tested and optimized to represent simple deformations of body shape. Finally;  a connection approach of body parts is proposed by sharing a boundary curve. The proposed method has been tested with the developed virtual human model (VHM) system which is robust and easier to use. The model can also be imported in a CAD environment for other applications.
