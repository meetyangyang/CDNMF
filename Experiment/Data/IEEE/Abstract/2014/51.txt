Human activity is among the critical information for a context-aware energy saving system since knowing what activities are undertaken is important for judging if energy is well spent. Most of the prior works on energy saving do not make the best of context-awareness especially in a multiuser environment to assist the energy saving system. In addition;  they often ignore whether appliances are operating implicitly or explicitly related to the context. These factors may compromise the practicality and acceptability of most of the currently available energy saving systems;  thus failing to meet real user needs. Therefore;  we propose Energy-Responsive Aggregate Context (ERAC) to model multi-resident activities and their associated energy consumption. Based on the relationship;  implicit or explicit;  between a given appliance and its associated context;  an energy saving system and its users can better determine whether the power consumed by the appliance is wasted. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
