Human action recognition in video is often approached by means of sequential probabilistic models as they offer a natural match to the temporal dimension of the actions. However;  effective estimation of the models' parameters is critical if one wants to achieve significant recognition accuracy. Parameter estimation is typically performed over a set of training data by maximizing objective functions such as the data likelihood or the conditional likelihood. However;  such functions are nonconvex in nature and subject to local maxima. This problem is major since any solution algorithm (expectation-maximization;  gradient ascent;  variational methods and others) requires an arbitrary initialization and can only find a corresponding local maximum. Exhaustive search is otherwise impossible since the number of local maxima is unknown. While no theoretical solutions are available for this problem;  the only practicable mollification is to repeat training with different initializations until satisfactory cross-validation accuracy is attained. Such a process is overall empirical and highly time-consuming. In this paper;  we propose two methods for one-off initialization of hidden Markov models achieving interesting tradeoffs between accuracy and training time. Experiments over three challenging human action video datasets (Weizmann;  MuHAVi and Hollywood Human Actions) and with various feature sets measured from the frames (STIP descriptors;  projection histograms;  notable contour points) prove that the proposed one-off initializations are capable of achieving accuracy above the average of repeated random initializations and comparable to the best. In addition;  the methods proposed are not restricted solely to human action recognition as they suit time series classification as a general problem.
