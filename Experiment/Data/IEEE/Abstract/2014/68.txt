Efficient operation of the integrated optimization or automation system in an industrial plant depends mainly on good measurement of product quality. However;  measuring or estimating the product quality online in many industrial plants is usually not feasible using the available techniques. In this paper;  a data-driven soft-sensor using case-based reasoning (CBR) and fuzzy-similarity rough sets is proposed for product quality estimation. Owning to the sustained learning ability;  the modeling of a CBR soft-sensor does not need any additional model correction which is otherwise required by the neural network based methods to overcome the slow time-varying nature of industrial processes. Because the conventional k-nearest neighbor ( k-NN) algorithm is strongly influenced by the value of k;  an improved k-NN algorithm with dynamic adjustment of case similarity threshold is proposed to retrieve sufficient matching cases for making a correct estimation. Moreover;  considering that the estimation accuracy of the CBR soft-sensor system is closely related to the weights of case feature;  a feature weighting algorithm using fuzzy-similarity rough sets is proposed in this paper. This feature weighting method does not require any transcendental knowledge;  and its computation complexity is only linear with respect to the number of cases and attributes. The developed soft-sensor system has been successfully applied in a large grinding plant in China. And the application results show that the system has achieved satisfactory estimation accuracy and adaptation ability.
