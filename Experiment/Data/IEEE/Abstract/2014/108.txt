In this paper;  a novel strategy is established to design the robust controller for a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems with uncertainties based on the online policy iteration algorithm. The robust control problem is transformed into the optimal control problem by properly choosing a cost function that reflects the uncertainties;  regulation;  and control. An online policy iteration algorithm is presented to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation by constructing a critic neural network. The approximate expression of the optimal control policy can be derived directly. The closed-loop system is proved to possess the uniform ultimate boundedness. The equivalence of the neural-network-based HJB solution of the optimal control problem and the solution of the robust control problem is established as well. Two simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the present robust control scheme.
