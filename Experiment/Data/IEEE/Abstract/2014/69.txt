This paper introduces the development and implementation of a ball mill grinding circuit simulator;  NEUSimMill. Compared to the existing simulators in this field which focus on process flowsheeting;  NEUSimMill is designed to be used for the test and verification of grinding process control system including advanced control system such as integrated control. The simulator implements the dynamic ball mill grinding model which formulates the dynamic responses of the process variables and the product particle size distribution to disturbances and control behaviors as well. First principles models have been used in conjunction with heuristic inference tools such as fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks: giving rise to a hybrid intelligent model which is valid across a large operating range. The model building in the simulator adopts a novel modular-based approach which is made possible by the dynamic sequential solving approach. The simulator can be initiated with connection to a real controller to track the plant state and display in real-time the effect of various changes on the simulated plant. The simulation model and its implementation is verified and validated through a case of application to the design;  development;  and deployment of optimal setting control system.
