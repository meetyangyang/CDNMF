Efficient utilization of resources is an important issue in the operation of modern radar systems. This paper develops a generalized framework for the radar task scheduling problem as an optimization model. In the proposed method;  all radar task parameters are treated as variables;  thereby allowing greater scheduling flexibility and the ability to handle more targets using a single radar. An efficient heuristic scheduling method is also proposed and computational results are presented to asses the performance of the proposed method.
