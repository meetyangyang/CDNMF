In this paper;  we present a set covering problem (SCP) formulation to compute the degree of redundancy of linear systems. Computing the degree of redundancy of a linear system allows for the evaluation of the quality of the sensor network. The formulation is equivalent to solving the linear matroid cogirth problem;  finding the cardinality of the smallest cocircuit of a matroid. We also discuss existing methods developed to solve the matroid cogirth problem and the SCP. Computational results are provided to validate a branch-and-cut algorithm that addresses the SCP formulation.
