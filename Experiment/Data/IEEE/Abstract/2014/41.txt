FlexRay is a communication bus (and associated protocol) that supports transmission of time-triggered and event-triggered frames. A method for determining the worst-case response-time of FlexRay frames is proposed by Pop in 2008;  and is formulated as iterative sequence of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problems. As we show;  the method of Pop is conservative (overestimates the response time). We propose a new ILP formulation that computes a precise value of the worst-case response time of FlexRay frames transmitted in the dynamic segment. Furthermore;  our approach is non-iterative as it requires the solving of a single ILP for computing;  respectively;  the delay of full bus cycles and the delay of a partial (last) bus cycle. The proposed solution is also validated by applying it to a SAE benchmark and can be used for formally guaranteeing that no message will miss its deadline during system operation.
