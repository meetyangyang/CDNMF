If there are transitions in a Petri net (PN) that cannot be prevented from firing by a supervisory policy;  then we have a partially controlled PN. The existence of a liveness enforcing supervisory policy (LESP) in a partially controlled ordinary PN is undecidable. Consequently;  there can be no algorithms that synthesize an LESP for an arbitrary ordinary (general) PN. In contrast;  we identify a class of general free-choice PN (FCPN) structures;  which strictly includes the class of ordinary FCPN structures;  where the existence of an LESP in any marked member of the class is decidable.
