In the assembly modeling of complex products;  it is not unusual facing an explosive growth of assembly relations;  or called combination explosion. Through integrating object-oriented methods with the knowledge template based modeling;  in this paper;  a new methodology is proposed to deal with the complexity of the assemblies of large-scale products. As such;  the templates with various assembly relations can be defined for complex products; constitutive parts or subassemblies in a product structure are defined as object classes; their features can be encapsulated;  and defined or modified freely via the parameters of object classes to meet the requirements of a specific instance. The new method supports reusing knowledge and simplifying assembly modeling of complex products. In this paper;  recent literatures on object-oriented methodologies and knowledge template methods for assembly modeling are reviewed;  the rationales of object-oriented templates are discussed;  and a method is proposed for creating assembly templates for complex products. In the case study included in this paper;  the developed method has been applied to digital modeling of aero-engines;  thus;  validating its performance.
