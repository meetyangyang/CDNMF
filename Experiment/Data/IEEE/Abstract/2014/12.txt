In this paper;  we focus on labeled Petri nets with silent transitions that may either correspond to fault events or to regular unobservable events. We address the problem of deriving a procedure to determine if a given net system is diagnosable;  i.e.;  the occurrence of a fault event may be detected for sure after a finite observation. The proposed procedure is based on our previous results on the diagnosis of discrete-event systems modeled with labeled Petri nets;  whose key notions are those of basis markings and minimal explanations;  and is inspired by the diagnosability approach for finite state automata proposed by Sampath in 1995. In particular;  we first give necessary and sufficient conditions for diagnosability. Then;  we present a method to test diagnosability that is based on the analysis of two graphs that depend on the structure of the net;  including the faults model;  and the initial marking.
