For the complex systems;  the development of a methodology of fault diagnosis is important. Indeed;  for such systems;  an efficient diagnosis contributes to the improvement of the availability;  the growth of production;  and;  of course;  the reduction of maintenance costs. It is a key action in the improvement of performance of industrial feature. This paper proposes a new approach to diagnose complex systems modeled by communicating timed automata. Each component has been modeled separately by a timed automaton integrating various operating modes while the communication between the various components is carried out by the control module. Starting from each module of the complex system;  a single deterministic automaton;  called a diagnoser;  is constructed that uses observable events to detect the occurrence of a failure. This modeling formalism provides means for formal verification of the complex system model and its diagnoser. The model-checking methods are used to check correctness properties. The steps of the method are described by an algorithm and illustrated through a batch neutralization process. The implementation of the algorithm is also discussed.
