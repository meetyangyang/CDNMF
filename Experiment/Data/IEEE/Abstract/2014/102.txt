This paper presents an approach to emulate the Poisson process observed by a sensor when subject to low levels of radiation;  motivated by the problem of detecting a weak source in the presence of background radiation. We construct a physical emulation of this process to serve as a means of experimentation for various detection models involving mobile sensor networks. A pulsing laser emulates the nuclear emission;  and a rotating mirror deflects the pulses in a random direction. The degree to which the proposed emulation process matches actual radiation measurement results is assessed experimentally;  and the utility of the device is demonstrated and compared against conventional methods in a simple detection scenario.
