It is very crucial for the byproduct gas system in steel industry to perform an accurate and timely scheduling;  which enables to reasonably utilize the energy resources and effectively reduce the production cost of enterprises. In this study;  a novel data-driven-based dynamic scheduling thought is proposed for the real-time gas scheduling;  in which a probability relationship described by a Bayesian network is modeled to determine the adjustable gas users that impact on the gas tanks level;  and to give their scheduling amounts online by maximizing the posterior probability of the users' operational statuses. For the practical applicability;  the obtained scheduling solution can be further verified by a recurrent neural network reported in literature. To indicate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven scheduling method;  the real gas flow data coming from a steel plant in China are employed;  and the experimental results indicate that the proposed method can provide real-time and scientific gas scheduling solution for the energy system of steel industry.
