The thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) module assembly production is a flexible job-shop scheduling problem that is critical to satisfy the customer demands on time. On the module assembly shop floor;  each workstation has identical and non-identical parallel machines that access the jobs at various processing velocities depending on the product families. To satisfy the various jobs;  the machines need to be set up as the numerous tools to conduct consecutive products. This study aims to propose a novel approach to address the TFT-LCD module assembly scheduling problem by simultaneously considering the following multiple and often conflicting objectives such as the makespan;  the weighted number of tardy jobs;  and the total machine setup time;  subject to the constraints of product families;  non-identical parallel machines;  and sequence-dependent setup times. In particular;  we developed a multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm (MO-HGA) that hybridizes with the variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm as a local search and TOPSIS evaluation technique to derive the best compromised solution. To estimate the validity of the proposed MO-HGA;  experiments based on empirical data were conducted to compare the results with conventional approaches. The results have shown the validity of this approach. This study concludes with a discussion of future research directions.
