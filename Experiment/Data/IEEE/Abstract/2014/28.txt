Care services within the patient rooms are the most critical and time consuming processes in patient care deliveries in emergency department;  clinics;  and other healthcare facilities. In this paper;  we introduce a Markov chain model to study such processes. A closed;  parallel;  and reentrant network with limited resources is used to model the process. Formulas to evaluate the patient length of stay and staff utilizations are developed. System-theoretic properties are discussed. The extension to non-Markovian scenarios is also investigated. Such a model provides a quantitative tool for healthcare professionals to study and improve patient flow in care deliveries.
