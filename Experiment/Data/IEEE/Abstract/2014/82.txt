Scheduling of tasks on a multi-machine system to reduce the makespan;  while satisfying the precedence constraints between the tasks;  is known to be an NP-hard problem. We propose a new formulation and show that energy-aware scheduling is a generalization of the minimum makespan scheduling problem. Taking the system graph and program graph as inputs;  we propose three different algorithms for energy-aware scheduling;  each of them having its own strengths and limitations. The first is a genetic algorithm (Plain GA) that searches for an energy reducing schedule. The second (CA+GA) uses cellular automata (CA) to generate low energy schedules;  while using a genetic algorithm (GA) to find good rules for the CA. The third (EAH) is a heuristic which gives preference to high-efficiency machines in allocation. We have tested our algorithms on well-known program graphs and compared our results with other state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms;  which confirms the efficacy of our approach. Our work also gives insight into the time-energy trade-offs in scheduling.
