A generic state-vector transition (SVT) model is suggested;  including a flexible synchronous composition involving both shared variables and events. This model is analyzed;  focusing on properties that are important for supervisor synthesis. A synthesis procedure is then developed for the SVT model;  where supervisor guards are generated that guarantee a controllable;  nonblocking and maximally permissive supervisor. Novel conditions are introduced;  such that more flexible specifications can be applied than earlier suggested for related models. Since the SVT model includes automata and (colored) Petri nets;  optionally extended with variables;  guards and actions;  as special cases;  the suggested synthesis approach unifies supervisor synthesis for the main discrete event model classes. Finally;  the SVT model is naturally represented and efficiently computed based on binary decision diagrams;  and the resulting supervisor guards are easily implemented in industrial control systems.
