Improving quality in large volume battery manufacturing systems for hybrid and electric vehicles is of significant importance. In this paper;  we present a flow model to analyze and improve product quality in electrical vehicle battery assembly lines with 100% inspections and repairs for defective parts. Specifically;  a battery assembly line consisting of multiple inspection stations is considered. After each inspection;  defective parts will be repaired and sent back to the line. A quality flow model is introduced to analyze quality propagations along the battery production line. Analytical expressions of final product quality are derived and structural properties;  such as monotonicity and sensitivities;  are investigated. A bottleneck identification and mitigation method is introduced to improve quality performance. Finally;  a case study is presented to illustrate the applicability of the method.
