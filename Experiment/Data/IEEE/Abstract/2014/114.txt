In this paper;  we investigate recoverability of discrete-event systems with faults. For a discrete-event system;  recoverability is defined as the ability to fire recovery events after the occurrence of a finite number of events for any event sequence which leads the system to faulty modes. By constructing the observer of the system;  we discuss how to check whether the system is recoverable or not. Furthermore;  we propose one more efficient approach to check recoverability. Finally;  all the results are illustrated by a practical example.
