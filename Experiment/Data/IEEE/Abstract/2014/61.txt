In this paper;  a novel iterative two-stage dual heuristic programming (DHP) is proposed to solve the optimal control problems for a class of discrete-time switched nonlinear systems subject to actuators saturation. First;  a novel nonquadratic performance functional is introduced to confront control constraints of the saturating actuator. Then;  the iterative two-stage DHP algorithm is developed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the switched system with the saturating actuator. Moreover;  the convergence and optimality of the two-stage DHP algorithm are strictly proven. To implement this algorithm efficiently;  there are two neural networks used as parametric structure to approximate the costate function and the corresponding control law;  respectively. Finally;  simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
