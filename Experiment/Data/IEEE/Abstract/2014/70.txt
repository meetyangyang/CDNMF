In this paper;  two adaptive observer-based strategies are proposed for control of nonlinear processes using input/output (I/O) data. In the two strategies;  pseudo-partial derivative (PPD) parameter of compact form dynamic linearization and PPD vector of partial form dynamic linearization are all estimated by the adaptive observer;  which are used to dynamically linearize a nonlinear system. The two proposed control algorithms are only based on the PPD parameter estimation derived online from the I/O data of the controlled system;  and Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to prove all signals of close-loop control system are bounded. A numerical example;  a steam-water heat exchanger example and an experimental test show that the proposed control algorithm has a very reliable tracking ability and a satisfactory robustness to disturbances and process dynamics variations.
