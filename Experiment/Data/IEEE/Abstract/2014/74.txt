The advertising budget allocation problem for financial service is dealt with based on statistical learning and evolutionary computation in this paper. Taking the carry-over effects of the advertising into account;  the least squares support vector machine regression (LS-SVMR) is used to construct the response model. A comparison between the proposed response model and traditional regression method based market response models is implemented. The results show the effectiveness and validity of the former model. Taking the budgets allocated to every month in the planning horizon as decision variables;  the budget allocation optimization model is built and an improved differential evolution algorithm is used to find the optimal solutions. Finally;  the proposed budget allocation method is illustrated by a practical problem.
