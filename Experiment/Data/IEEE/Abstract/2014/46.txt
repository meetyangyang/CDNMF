Part feeders take an unsorted bulk of identical parts and output them in a uniform orientation. Common feeders sort out those items that settle initially on one specific face;  and further reorient them as desired. Quick estimators of the probability of settling on a given face facilitate the design of parts for efficient feeding and of the feeding lines themselves. Nevertheless;  the evaluation and the development of such estimators have been hindered by the lack of data. Here;  I create and analyze a large;  simulated dataset; evaluate estimators available in the literature by comparing their predictions to simulation results with the help of a custom-made metric; and propose new estimation algorithms. The new estimators offer viable alternative to the direct dynamic simulation of parts due to their low average errors.
