This paper presents a passive-marker-based optical tracking system utilizing dual Kinect sensors and additional custom optical tracking components. To obtain sub-millimeter tracking accuracy;  we introduce robust calibration of dual infrared sensors and point correspondence establishment in a stereo configuration. The 3D localization is subsequently accomplished using multiple back projection lines. The proposed system extends existing inexpensive consumer electronic devices;  implements tracking algorithms;  and shows the feasibility of applying the proposed low-cost system to surgical training for computer assisted surgeries.
