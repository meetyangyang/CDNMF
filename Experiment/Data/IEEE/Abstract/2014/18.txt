Buildings worldwide account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption. The biggest energy consumer in buildings is the Heating;  Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC also ranks top in terms of number of complaints by tenants. Maintaining HVAC systems in good conditions through early fault detection is thus a critical problem. The problem;  however;  is difficult since HVAC systems are large in scale;  consisting of many coupling subsystems;  building and equipment dependent;  and working under time-varying conditions. In this paper;  a model-based and data-driven method is presented for robust system-level fault detection with potential for large-scale implementation. It is a synergistic integration of: ) Statistical Process Control (SPC) for measuring and analyzing variations; 2) Kalman filtering based on gray-box models to provide predictions and to determine SPC control limits; and (3) system analysis for analyzing propagation of faults' effects across subsystems. In the method;  two new SPC rules are developed for detecting sudden and gradual faults. The method has been tested against a simulation model of the HVAC system for a 420-meter-high building. It detects both sudden faults and gradual degradation;  and both device and sensor faults. Furthermore;  the method is simple and generic;  and has potential replicability and scalability.
