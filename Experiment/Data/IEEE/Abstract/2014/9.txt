An earlier work of ours has proposed a novel approach for the deployment of the maximally permissive deadlock avoidance policy for complex resource allocation systems (RAS);  that is based on the identification and the efficient storage of a critical subset of states of the underlying RAS state space; the availability of this information enables an expedient one-step-lookahead scheme for the identification and blockage of transitions that will take the system behavior outside its safe region. This paper complements the aforementioned results by introducing a novel algorithm that provides those critical states while avoiding the complete enumeration of the RAS state space.
