In human and robot collaborative hybrid assembly cell as we proposed;  it is important to develop automatic subtask allocation strategy for human and robot in usage of their advantages. We introduce a folk-joint task model that describes the sequential and parallel features and logic restriction of human and robot collaboration appropriately. To preserve a cost-effectiveness level of task allocation;  we develop a logic mathematic method to quantitatively describe this discrete-event system by considering the system tradeoff between the assembly time cost and payment cost. A genetic based revolutionary algorithm is developed for real-time and reliable subtask allocation to meet the required cost-effectiveness. This task allocation strategy is built for a human worker and collaborates with various robot co-workers to meet the small production situation in future. The performance of proposed algorithm is experimentally studied;  and the cost-effectiveness is analyzed comparatively on an electronic assembly case.
