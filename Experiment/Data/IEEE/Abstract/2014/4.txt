Extended labeled Petri nets (ELPNs);  i.e.;  labeled Petri nets with inhibitor arcs;  are usually used to model the desired closed-loop behavior of a controlled discrete-event system;  and;  as such;  their states are formed with both the controller and the plant states. However;  the control logic is based on the controller states only and the interaction between controller and plant is carried out through sensor readings from the plant and control actions (forced events) from the controller. This makes ELPN not suitable for modeling the controller. Control interpreted Petri nets (CIPNs);  on the other hand;  include control actions in the places and sensor readings in the transitions as part of their formal structure;  and so provide a better formalism for controller modeling. In this paper;  we propose a two-step approach to discrete-event controller implementation;  as follows: (i) we first propose a set of transformation rules to convert the initial ELPN to an equivalent CIPN;  therefore extracting the control logic from the desired closed-loop behavior and (ii) we present a straightforward systematic way to translate the CIPN into a ladder diagram. We apply the results presented here to the implementation of the automation system of a plastic molding machine.
