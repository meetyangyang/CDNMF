This paper describes an adaptable system which is able to perform manipulation operations (such as Peg-in-Hole or Laying-Down actions) with flexible objects. As such objects easily change their shape significantly during the execution of an action;  traditional strategies;  e.g;  for solve path-planning problems;  are often not applicable. It is therefore required to integrate visual tracking and shape reconstruction with a physical modeling of the materials and their deformations as well as action learning techniques. All these different submodules have been integrated into a demonstration platform;  operating in real-time. Simulations have been used to bootstrap the learning of optimal actions;  which are subsequently improved through real-world executions. To achieve reproducible results;  we demonstrate this for casted silicone test objects of regular shape.
