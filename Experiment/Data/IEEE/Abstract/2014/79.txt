This study proposes an online monitoring technique for nonlinear multiple-mode problems in industrial processes. The contributions of the proposed technique are summarized as follows: 1) Lazy learning (LL);  a new adaptive local modeling method;  is introduced for multiple-mode process monitoring. In this method;  multiple modes are separated and accurately modeled online;  and the between-mode dynamic process is considered. 2) The modified receptor density algorithm (MRDA) exhibiting superior nonlinear ability is introduced to analyze the residuals between the actual system output and the model-predicted output. The simulation of the Tennessee Eastman process with multiple operation modes shows that compared with other techniques mentioned in this study;  the proposed technique performs more accurately and is more suitable for nonlinear processes with multiple operation modes.
