Multivariate process control in Distributed Sensor Networks (DSNs) is an important and challenging topic. Although a fully deployed sensor network will minimize information loss;  the associated sensing cost can be overwhelming. Many efforts have been made to investigate the optimal sensor allocation strategy for different process control applications; however;  most of them assume that the sensor layout is fixed once sensors are deployed in the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptively reallocate sensor resources based on online observations;  which can enhance both monitoring and diagnosis capabilities. The proposed adaptive sensor allocation strategy addresses two fundamental issues: when to reallocate sensors and how to update sensor layout. A max-min criterion is developed to manage sensor reallocation and process change detection in an integrated manner. To investigate the adaptive strategy;  a Bayesian Network (BN) model is assumed available to represent the causal relationships among a set of variables. Case studies are performed on a hot forming process and a cap alignment process to illustrate the procedure and evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different fault scenarios.
