Though the structured light measurement system has been successfully applied to the profile measurement of diffuse objects;  it is still a challenge to measure shiny objects due to the mix of both specular and diffuse reflections. To this end;  we propose a robust encoding and decoding method in this paper. First;  the monochromatic stripe patterns are utilized to eliminate the effect of texture and color of objects. Second;  an intensity mask;  dynamically adjusting the intensity of a projected pattern;  is applied to avoid overexposure without any pre-knowledge of the workpiece. Thus;  it is more flexible and efficient;  compared with the existing methods. Third;  to solve the internal reflection of the shiny part;  an extrapolation model;  combined with the intensity mask;  is developed to detect the stripe edge for pattern decoding;  resulting in accurate and robust 3D reconstruction. Compared with traditional polarization based methods;  it does not need to readjust for a new part. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of measuring various parts without surface pretreatment.
