Computing the degree of redundancy for structured linear systems is proven to be NP-hard. A linear system whose model matrix is of size n√óp is considered structured if some p row vectors in the model matrix are linearly dependent. Bound-and-decompose and 0-1 mixed integer programming (MIP) are two approaches to compute the degree of redundancy;  which were previously proposed and compared in the literature. In this paper;  first we present an enhanced version of the bound-and-decompose algorithm;  which is substantially (up to 30 times) faster than the original version. We then present a novel hybrid algorithm to measure redundancy in structured linear systems. This algorithm uses a 0-1 mixed integer feasibility checking algorithm embedded within a bound-and-decompose framework. Our computational study indicates that this new hybrid approach significantly outperforms the existing algorithms as well as our enhanced version of bound-and-decompose in several instances. We also perform a computational study that shows matrix density has a significant effect on the runtime of the algorithms.
