Service computing plays a critical role in business automation and we can observe a rapid increase of web services and their compositions nowadays. Web services;  their compositions;  providers;  consumers;  and other entities such as context information;  collectively form an evolving service ecosystem. Many service recommendation methods have been proposed to facilitate the use of services. However;  existing approaches are mostly based on all-time statistics of usage patterns;  and overlook the temporal aspect;  i.e.;  the evolution of the ecosystem. As a result;  recommendation may consist of obsolete services and also does not reflect the latest trend in the ecosystem. In order to overcome this limitation;  we propose an innovative three-phase network prediction approach (NPA) for evolution-aware recommendation. First;  we introduce a network series model to formalize the evolution of the service ecosystem and then develop a network analysis method to study the usage pattern with a special focus on its temporal evolution. Afterward a novel service network prediction method based on rank aggregation is proposed to predict the evolution of the network. Finally;  using the network prediction model;  we present how to recommend potential compositions;  top services and service chains;  respectively. Experiments on the real-world ProgrammableWeb data set show that our method achieves a superior performance in service recommendation;  compared with those that are agnostic to the evolution of a service ecosystem.
