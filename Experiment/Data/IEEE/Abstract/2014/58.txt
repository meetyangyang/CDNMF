This paper quantitatively reports about potential energy savings on robotic assembly lines for the automotive industry. At first;  a detailed system model is described;  which improves previously published results by explicitly considering both manipulator and electrical drive dynamics. The model closely captures experimental data in terms of actuation torques and servodrive voltages;  which are directly used to derive the plant input power. Two practical methods are then evaluated for reducing the overall energy consumption. The methods rely on: 1) implementation of energy-optimal trajectories obtained by means of time scaling;  concerning the robots' motion from the last process point to the home positions and 2) reduction of energy consumption by releasing the actuator brakes earlier when the robots are kept stationary. Simulation results;  based on the production timing characteristics measured at a real plant;  clearly shows that the system energy consumption can be effectively reduced without negative effects on the production rate.
