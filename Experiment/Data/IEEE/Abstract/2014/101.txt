Microrobots are promising tools for micromanipulation and minimally invasive interventions. Robust electromagnetic control of microrobots can be achieved through precisely modeled magnetic steering systems and accurate localization. Error-free modeling and position information;  however;  are not realistic assumptions;  and microrobots need to be controlled under force and localization uncertainties. In this paper;  methods to account for these types of uncertainties are presented. Initially;  the uncertainties in electromagnetic force generation of a new class of manipulation systems are quantified. Subsequently;  a drag-force uncertainty model for linear dynamics is proposed. This model can be employed for microrobots whose fluid dynamics are not well understood. A set of performance measures is introduced in the design of controllers;  and a PID and a robust H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>∞</sub>\n controller are synthesized and evaluated through simulations. To demonstrate the capabilities of the synthesized controllers under localization and force uncertainties;  low update rates are considered. The H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>∞</sub>\n controller can provably respect the performance measures under higher uncertainties than the PID controller;  and its performance is further quantified through experiments in a prototype electromagnetic control system.
