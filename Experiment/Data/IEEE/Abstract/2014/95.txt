In this paper;  we present a method for using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to synthesize controller gains for a quadrotor system. The controller is based on approximate feedback linearization and is structured to allow for tuning similar to proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. The synthesis procedure generates suboptimal gains with respect to mixed \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><tex Notation=\TeX\>${\\cal H}_{2}$</tex></formula>\n and \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><tex Notation=\TeX\>${\\cal H}_{\\infty}$</tex></formula>\n performance cost functions and a pole placement region constraint. The basic procedure is extended to account for dynamic external disturbances;  inexact nonlinearity cancellation;  multiplicative actuator uncertainty;  and saturated integrators in the control loop. The controller is tested in a real-world flight using 10 Hz position updates with 2 cm standard deviation noise to approximate GPS or vision-based control scenarios.
