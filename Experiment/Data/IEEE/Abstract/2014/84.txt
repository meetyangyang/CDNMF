This paper proposes and investigates a weighted velocity and acceleration minimization scheme to prevent the occurrence of high joint velocity and joint acceleration caused by the minimum acceleration norm (MAN) scheme in redundant robot manipulators. The proposed scheme considers minimum kinetic energy (MKE) and MAN criterions via two weighting factors;  thus guaranteeing the final joint velocity of motion to be near zero;  which is acceptable for engineering applications. Joint physical constraints (i.e.;  joint angle limits;  joint velocity limits;  and joint acceleration limits) are incorporated in the formulation of the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is reformulated as a quadratic program and then calculated by using a numerical algorithm based on linear variational inequality. Computer simulation results of a PUMA560 robot manipulator verify the efficacy and flexibility of the proposed scheme for redundancy resolution in robot manipulators. Experimental verifications conducted on a six-link planar robot manipulator demonstrate the effectiveness and physical realizability of the proposed scheme.
