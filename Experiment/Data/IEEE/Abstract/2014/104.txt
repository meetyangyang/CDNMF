Recently;  the temporal constraint satisfiability is regarded as an important criterion in Web service composition to guarantee its timely completion. This leads to a new challenge in analyzing the compatibility of Web services under temporal constraints. The existing methods either do not consider message mismatches between services in a composition or suffer from state-space explosion by verifying a service composition model as a whole; or lack the ability to generate execution paths of each participating service. In this paper;  we present a Petri net-based method to address these three issues in a holistic manner;  and also in a modular way. Compared with the existing work;  the proposed approach not only composes Web services by adding a mediation net to deal with message mismatches;  but also checks the compatibility w.r.t. temporal constraints by generating modular timed state graphs. Furthermore;  the reliable and usable execution paths that satisfy the timed compatibility can be derived to guide service execution and avoid any temporal exception.
