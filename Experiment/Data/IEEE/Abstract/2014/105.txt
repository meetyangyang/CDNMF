This work presents a novel feature extraction approach called nonuniform scale-frequency map for environmental sound classification in home automation. For each audio frame;  important atoms from the Gabor dictionary are selected by using the Matching Pursuit algorithm. After the system disregards phase and position information;  the scale and frequency of the atoms are extracted to construct a scale-frequency map. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) are then applied to the scale-frequency map;  subsequently generating the proposed feature. During the classification phase;  a segment-level multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) is operated. Experiments on a 17-class sound database indicate that the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy rate of 86.21%. Furthermore;  a comparison reveals that the proposed approach is superior to the other time-frequency methods.
