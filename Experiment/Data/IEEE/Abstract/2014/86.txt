This paper describes automated procedures for the design and deployment of artificial skin for humanoid robots. This problem is challenging under different perspectives: on the one hand;  different robots are characterized by different shapes;  thereby requiring a high degree of skin customization; on the other hand;  it is necessary to define optimal criteria specifying how the skin must be placed on robot parts. This paper addresses the problem of optimally covering robot parts with tactile sensors;  discussing possible solutions with reference to a specific artificial skin technology for robots;  which has been developed in the past few years. Results show that it is possible to automate the majority of the required steps;  with promising results in view of a future complete automation of the process.
