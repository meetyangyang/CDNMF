From long to short term planning;  decision processes inherent to operating theater organization are often subject of empiricism;  leading to far from optimal results. Waiting lists for surgery have always been a societal problem;  which governments have been fighting with different management and operational stimulus plans. The current hospital information systems available in Portuguese public hospitals;  lack a decision support system component that could help achieve better planning solutions. Thus;  an intelligent decision support system has been developed;  allowing the centralization and standardization of planning processes;  improving the efficiency of the operating theater and tackling the waiting lists for surgery fragile situation. The intelligence of the system derives from data mining and optimization techniques;  which enhance surgery duration predictions and operating rooms surgery schedules. Experimental results show significant gains;  reducing overtime;  undertime;  and better resource utilization.
