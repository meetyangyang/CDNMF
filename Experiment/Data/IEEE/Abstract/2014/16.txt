Generation of high-quality drive paths is a significant issue for automated wheeled vehicles. To achieve this aim for a truck and trailer vehicle;  the paper proposes the use of a parameterized curve primitive;  the \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex Notation=\TeX\>${\\mbi \\eta}^4$</tex></formula>\n-spline. Using this spline;  generation and shaping of smooth feasible paths is made possible as well as the transfer between arbitrary dynamic configurations of the articulated vehicle. The \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><tex Notation=\TeX\>${\\mbi \\eta}^4$</tex> </formula>\n-spline is a ninth-order polynomial curve that can interpolate given Cartesian points with associated arbitrary unit tangent vector;  curvature;  and first and second derivatives of curvature. It depends on a set of eight (eta) parameters that can be freely chosen to modify the path shape without changing the interpolations conditions at the path endpoints. Completeness;  minimality;  and symmetry of the \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><tex Notation=\TeX\>${\\mbi \\eta}^4$</tex></formula>\n-spline are established. An example on a parking maneuver of the articulated vehicle is presented and the pertinent optimal path planning is also discussed.
