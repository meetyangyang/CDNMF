Cluster tools for some wafer fabrication processes such as low-pressure chemical vapor deposition have strict wafer delay constraints. A wafer that completes processing in a processing chamber should leave the chamber within a specified time limit. Otherwise;  the wafer suffers from severe quality troubles due to residual gases and heat within the chamber. An important engineering problem is to verify whether for given task times there exists a tool operation schedule that satisfies the wafer delay limit. There have been studies on the problem;  which all assume deterministic task times. However;  in reality;  the task times are subject to random variation. In this paper;  we develop a systematic method of determining schedulability of time-constrained decision-free discrete-event systems;  where time variation can be confined within finite intervals. To do this;  we propose an extended Petri net for modeling such systems. We then develop a necessary and sufficient condition for which there always exists a feasible schedule and one for which there never exists any feasible schedule. We develop a graph-based computational procedure for verifying the schedulability conditions and determining the worst-case task delay. We demonstrate how the procedure can be used for cluster tool engineering to control wafer delays against wafer alignment failures and time variation.
