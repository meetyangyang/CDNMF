We describe a vibratory part transport mechanism that utilizes both static and dynamic friction to linearly transport parts in a horizontal direction. We derive a horizontal driving profile for the feeder surface that maximizes the steady-state velocity of parts on the surface subject to acceleration limits on the surface. Experiments verify the predicted transport behavior. We then derive the optimal feeding motion for a surface that can move in both the horizontal and vertical directions.
