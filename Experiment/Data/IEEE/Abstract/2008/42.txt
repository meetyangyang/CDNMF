In this paper;  fault diagnosis and accommodation control are developed for robotic systems. First;  a nonlinear observer in the proposed method is designed based on the available model. The fault detection is carried out by comparing the observer states with their signatures. Secondly;  state observers are constructed based on possible fault function sets. Thirdly;  the accommodation control design is developed using a normal controller plus a neural network compensator to capture the nonlinear characteristics of faults. Finally;  if the fault isolation is completed successfully;  the second fault accommodation controller is presented based on the fault information obtained by the isolation scheme.
