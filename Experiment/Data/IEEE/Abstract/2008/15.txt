Quantifying the rapid action of a mouse scratching its head with its hind leg can provide an objective behavioral indicator for atopic dermatitis;  and the development of new drugs for this disease can be significantly expedited by automating such quantification. In this paper;  we propose methods for extracting the scratching patterns of a mouse by focusing on its rapid and periodic behavioral patterns. We extracted the scratching patterns from the high-speed video images of actual laboratory mice;  and our experimental results show that scratching can be automatically quantified without misinterpretations.
