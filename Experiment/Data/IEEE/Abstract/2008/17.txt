In this paper;  we address a new scheduling model for a firm with an option of outsourcing. A job can be processed by either in-house production or outsourcing. All outsourced jobs have to be transported back to the firm in batches;  and the transportation costs have to be taken into account. We model the situation as a scheduling problem with transportation considerations. We discuss four commonly used objective functions;  and solve them by dynamic programming algorithms.
