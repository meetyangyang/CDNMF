This paper addresses the design of single commodity stochastic distribution networks. The distribution network under consideration consists of a single supplier serving a set of retailers through a set of distribution centers (DCs). The number and location of DCs are decision variables and they are chosen from the set of retailer locations. To manage inventory at DCs;  the economic order quantity (EOQ) policy is used by each DC;  and a safety stock level is kept to ensure a given retailer service level. Each retailer faces a random demand of a single commodity and the supply lead time from the supplier to each DC is random. The goal is to minimize the total location;  shipment;  and inventory costs;  while ensuring a given retailer service level. The introduction of inventory costs and safety stock costs leads to a nonlinear NP-hard optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach is proposed. Computational results are presented and analyzed showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
