This paper describes the control of an automatic overhead crane for assembly of modular building elements. The automatic system was developed using a commercial full-size crane;  which was modified by adding adequate sensors;  servomotors;  and control strategy. The crane;  which maintained its original cables;  was converted to a robotic system;  and is controlled via a computer-based multiaxes control board. The implemented algorithms solve two main problems of module assembly: 1) precision positioning of large and heavy modules in the order of a few centimeters;  and 2) anti-swinging transportation of modules;  even in difficult weather conditions (not extreme). The implementation of the anti-swinging control is achieved using the on-line two-dimensional inclinometer measurements and an on-line calculation of input impulse trains. The developed input-shaping control is divided into two phases: straight line motion and external perturbances cancellation. Experimental results of the developed algorithms which demonstrate the effectiveness of the new process are presented.
