This work intends to deal with the optimal kinematic synthesis problem of parallel manipulators under a unified framework. Observing that regular (e.g.;  hyper-rectangular) workspaces are desirable for most machines;  we propose the concept of effective regular workspace;  which reflects simultaneously requirements on the workspace shape and quality. The effectiveness of a workspace is characterized by the dexterity of the mechanism over every point in the workspace. Other performance indices;  such as manipulability and stiffness;  provide alternatives of dexterity characterization of workspace effectiveness. An optimal design problem;  including constraints on actuated/passive joint limits and link interference;  is then formulated to find the manipulator geometry that maximizes the effective regular workspace. This problem is a constrained nonlinear optimization problem without explicitly analytical expression. Traditional gradient based approaches may have difficulty in searching the global optimum. The controlled random search technique;  as reported robust and reliable;  is used to obtain an numerical solution. The design procedure is demonstrated through examples of a Delta robot and a Gough-Stewart platform.
