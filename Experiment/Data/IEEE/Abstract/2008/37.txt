This paper presents a new control mechanism based on a novel distinguished node (DN) model;  for network topology and analysis in small-agent networks such as urban traffic network. The proposed DN model is represented by an extended direct graph that contains congregation and dispersing nodes;  and main and connecting links. Both static and dynamic properties of the DN model are analyzed. With this new network model;  a control mechanism is developed;  which is governed by two heuristic rules of conflict avoidance and total delay minimization. A case study on a real urban traffic network is performed to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed DN model applied to the empirical networks;  and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control mechanism.
