In discrete manufacturing;  a just-in-time schedule is pursued so as to respond better to the market. It is also required in oil refinery. However;  the existing techniques for short-term scheduling in oil refinery are based on the push production mode. This paper addresses the short-term scheduling problem for crude oil operations in a pull production way. A target refining schedule resulting from production planning is given as a constraint to make an executable schedule. The system is modeled by a timed hybrid Petri net. This model is structurally simple and can describe the dynamic behavior and all the constraints of the system without any difficulty. Based on the model;  an efficient heuristic algorithm is proposed to test the realizability of a target refining schedule. If it is realizable;  a feasible short-term schedule realizing it is created. A real-life industrial case study is presented to show the industrial application of the proposed method.
