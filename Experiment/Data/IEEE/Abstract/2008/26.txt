Rather than dealing with the traditional one-dimension bin packing problem to minimize the cost in demand assignments;  the flexible demand assignment (FDA) problem studied in this paper considers the balance between revenue and cost. Compared with a number of solution methods in operations research;  we solve the FDA problem by three specially designed operators of neighborhood construction for search space-namely;  One Bin Repack;  Two Bins Repack;  and Unpack. Extensive computational results clearly show the superiority of the three proposed operators based on simple local search over the best published results.
