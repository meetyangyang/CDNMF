This paper defines a reconfiguration method for the class of discrete-event systems (DES) that is subject to linear constraints as their control specifications. Some existing methods for enforcing these constraints make use of Petri-net P-invariants for controller synthesis. These methods are quite appealing because their computational complexity is much more tractable than most other methods for controller synthesis. However;  a common limitation of all existing P-invariant-based control architectures for DES plants is the assumption that the linear constraints defining the control specification of the plant do not change over time. Here;  we relax this assumption and allow the control specifications to change during controller runtime. Under certain assumptions on DES behavior;  we automatically reconfigure the DES controller after the control specification is changed. In addition;  if the current state of the controlled DES has become infeasible under the new control specification;  we automatically generate a so-called plant reconfiguration procedure whose execution leads the system back to a feasible state. This reconfiguration procedure is optimal in that it seeks to minimize the cost of reconfiguration actions through an Integer Programming (IP) model. The objective function of the IP model can be used to generate reconfiguration solutions that meet some desired properties. Depending on the cost of each reconfiguration action;  a minimum cost reconfiguration solution may use only actions contained in the current plant configuration (an internal response);  or ask for a change in the plant configuration;  for instance;  by adding new resources (an external response);  or a combination of both strategies. Finally;  we illustrate our method by applying it to a hospital control system example.
