Group elevator scheduling has long been recognized as an important problem for building transportation efficiency;  since unsatisfactory elevator service is one of the major complaints of building tenants. It now has a new significance driven by homeland security concerns. The problem;  however;  is difficult because of complicated elevator dynamics;  uncertain traffic in various patterns;  and the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization. With the advent of technologies;  one important trend is to use advance information collected from devices such as destination entry;  radio frequency identification;  and sensor networks to reduce uncertainties and improve efficiency. How to effectively utilize such information remains an open and challenging issue. This paper presents the optimized scheduling of a group of elevators with destination entry and future traffic information for normal operations and coordinated emergency evacuation. Key problem characteristics are abstracted to establish a two-level separable formulation. A decomposition and coordination approach is then developed;  where subproblems are solved by ordinal optimization-based local search;  and top ranked nodes are selectively optimized by using dynamic programming. The approach is then extended to handle up-peak with little or no future traffic information;  elevator parking for low intensity traffic;  and coordinated emergency evacuation. Numerical testing results demonstrate near-optimal solution quality;  computational efficiency;  the value of future traffic information;  and the potential of using elevators for emergency evacuation.
