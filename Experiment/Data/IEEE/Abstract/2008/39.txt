This paper presents a novel technique to fabricate scaffold/cell constructs for tissue engineering by robotic assembly of microscopic building blocks (of volume 0.50.50.2 and 60 thickness). In this way;  it becomes possible to build scaffolds with freedom in the design of architecture;  surface morphology;  and chemistry. Biocompatible microparts with complex 3-D shapes were first designed and mass produced using MEMS techniques. Semi-automatic assembly was then realized using a robotic workstation with four degrees of freedom integrating a dedicated microgripper and two optical microscopes. Coarse movement of the gripper is determined by pattern matching in the microscopes images;  while the operator controls fine positioning and accurate insertion of the microparts. Successful microassembly was demonstrated using SU-8 and acrylic resin microparts. Taking advantage of parts distortion and adhesion forces;  which dominate at micro-level;  the parts cleave together after assembly. In contrast to many current scaffold fabrication techniques;  no heat;  pressure;  electrical effect;  or toxic chemical reaction is involved;  a critical condition for creating scaffolds with biological agents.
