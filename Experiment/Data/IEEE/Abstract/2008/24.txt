In practical situations;  a plausible plan for multiple companies should be created by mutual negotiation and coordination without sharing such confidential information as inventory costs;  setup costs;  and due date penalties for each company. In this paper;  we propose a framework for distributed optimization of supply chain planning using an augmented Lagrangian decomposition and coordination approach. A feature of the proposed method is that it can derive a near-optimal solution without requiring all of the information. The proposed method is applied to supply chain planning problems for a petroleum complex;  and a midterm planning problem for multiple companies. Computational experiments demonstrate that the average gap between a solution derived by the proposed method and the optimal solution is within 3% of the performance index;  even though only local information is used to derive a solution for each company. </para>.
