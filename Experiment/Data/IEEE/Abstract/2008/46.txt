This paper is devoted both to the study of observability criteria and the design of observers in the continuous Petri net setting. The concept of structural observability;  regarding the possibility of estimating the marking of places;  i.e.;  the system state;  for any speed of the transitions is introduced and studied for the subclass of join-free Petri nets (JF). For non-join-free Petri nets;  conditions to compute suitable state estimates are established. The proposed observers are piecewise linear systems that assure the continuity of the estimate even when a switch occurs. The system simulation may allow us to estimate even the unobservable space of the net system during a given time period.
