This paper considers a matrix-based discrete event control approach for a warehouse. The control system is organized in two modules: a dynamic model and a controller. The model provides a complete description of the discrete event dynamics of the warehouse;  and is used as a means to track the stock-keeping units;  and identify and inhibit control actions that violate system's constraints. The controller has several functions. At the supervisory level;  it is in charge of inhibiting operations that may lead to deadlocks;  commanding the actual start of the task;  and the release of the resources once a task is completed. At the operational level;  it is in charge of performing decisions regarding the order in which allowable tasks waiting for service should be performed. All the modules are implemented using the same matrix-based formalism;  and thus integrated with each other. The main advantages of the approach are the inherent modularity (the matrix-based control is obtained by assembling individual atomic components);  and the integration between the various modules;  which permits a better overall resource utilization. Simulation examples describing an actual industrial warehouse are finally provided to emphasize the main advantages of the proposed approach.
