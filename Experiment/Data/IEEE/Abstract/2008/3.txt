This work presents a robust environmental sound recognition system for home automation. Specific home automation services can be activated based on identified sound classes. Additionally;  when the sound category is human speech;  such speech can be recognized for detecting human intentions as in conventional research on home automation. To attain this ambitious goal;  this study uses two key techniques: signal-to-noise ratio-aware subspace-based signal enhancement and sound recognition with independent component analysis mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and a frame-based multiclass support vector machines;  respectively. Simulations and an experiment in a real-world environment are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed robust sound recognition system.
