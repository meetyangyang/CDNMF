This paper introduces a formalism for modeling interaction and control of partially observed discrete event systems (DESs);  called prioritized synchronous composition under mask (PSC/M). In PSC/M;  each system is associated with an event priority set and an observation mask. The existing formalisms have their limitations and what we propose is a general canonical mode of interaction that is suitable for control under partial observation as well as for modeling a variety of interaction modes such as strict/prioritized synchronization;  interleaving;  hiding;  and renaming. In PSC/M;  an event is globally enabled if it is locally enabled by all the interacting systems. The tracking of a globally enabled event is done by executing a transition on an indistinguishable event. PSC/M possesses the useful properties of commutativity and associativity. PSC/M can be applied to compose local controller modules having limited sensing and actuation capabilities to obtain an equivalent global controller module. PSC/M can itself be employed as a control mechanism;  in which case it helps remove the control and the observation compatibility requirements of a controller. We study the PSC/M-based control problem where both the plant and the supervisor have their own control and observation limitations. The plant and the specification models need not be at the same level of abstraction and so new classes of control problems can be solved in the framework. The existence condition is the achievability with respect to an augmented plant;  which is weaker than controllability and observability combined. The weaker condition is required since we allow supervisors to be nondeterministic;  which also facilitates the existence and synthesis to be performed polynomially in the size of the plant and the specification.
