First;  some results regarding equilibrium states and control actions are given. In particular;  it is shown that the considered systems are piecewise linear;  and for every linear subsystem the possible steady states are characterized. Second;  optimal steady-state control is studied;  a problem that surprisingly can be computed in polynomial time;  when all transitions are controllable and the objective function is linear. Third;  an interpretation of some controllability aspects in the framework of linear dynamic systems is presented. An interesting finding is that noncontrollable poles are zero valued.
