Home automation systems should evolve to the next phase in which they are aware of contexts;  because providing services based on contexts will upgrade the service quality;  thus making people more comfortable and home living more convenient. In particular;  location is a piece of important and useful context information for seeking appropriate services;  as well as providing them to people living in a home. So far;  there have been several studies focused on tracking inhabitants in smart home environments. However;  these approaches are often intrusive or require inhabitants to wear some sort of devices;  which may make the inhabitants uncomfortable or even inconvenient. This problem could devastate the ultimate goal;  which is to provide convenient services;  and hence cause such approaches somewhat controversial. In this study;  we utilize a number of load sensors together to construct a sensory floor on which exerted pressure can be detected and cover its surface with wooden flooring as in a normal home environment. Although the wooden flooring provides a flat surface for inhabitants to walk on;  it also causes clutter in the sensor readings;  which lead to difficulty in clearly identifying the location(s) of pressure source(s). Thus;  we apply probabilistic data association technique and LeZi-Update approach to analyze the cluttered pressure readings collected by the load sensors so as to determine the positions of the inhabitants;  as well as to track their movements. With our nonintrusive approach;  there is no need for inhabitants to wear any devices;  and this also solves the cross-walking problem in the home environment.
