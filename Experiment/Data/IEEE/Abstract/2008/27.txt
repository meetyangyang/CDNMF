Lean buffering is the smallest buffer capacity;  which is necessary and sufficient to ensure the desired production rate of a manufacturing system. Literature offers methods for designing lean buffering in production systems with identical machines. The current paper extends these methods to serial production lines with nonidentical machines;  assuming that they obey the exponential reliability model. For two-machine lines;  exact formulas for lean buffering are derived;  while for longer lines estimates are obtained. These results can be useful for production line designers and production managers to maintain the required production rate with the smallest possible inventories.
