This paper studies a large-scale scheduling problem in iron and steel industry;  called color-coating production scheduling for coils in inventory (CCPSCI). The problem is to select steel coils from those in the coil yard and to create a production schedule so that the productivity and product quality are maximized;  while the production cost and other penalties are minimized. A tabu search (TS) algorithm is proposed for this problem. Results on real production instances show that the proposed method is much more effective and efficient than manual scheduling.
