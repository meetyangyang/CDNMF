This paper presents a robust location-aware activity recognition approach for establishing ambient intelligence applications in a smart home. With observations from a variety of multimodal and unobtrusive wireless sensors seamlessly integrated into ambient-intelligence compliant objects (AICOs);  the approach infers a single resident's interleaved activities by utilizing a generalized and enhanced Bayesian Network fusion engine with inputs from a set of the most informative features. These features are collected by ranking their usefulness in estimating activities of interest. Additionally;  each feature reckons its corresponding reliability to control its contribution in cases of possible device failure;  therefore making the system more tolerant to inevitable device failure or interference commonly encountered in a wireless sensor network;  and thus improving overall robustness. This work is part of an interdisciplinary Attentive Home pilot project with the goal of fulfilling real human needs by utilizing context-aware attentive services. We have also created a novel application called ldquoActivity Maprdquo to graphically display ambient-intelligence-related contextual information gathered from both humans and the environment in a more convenient and user-accessible way. All experiments were conducted in an instrumented living lab and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.
