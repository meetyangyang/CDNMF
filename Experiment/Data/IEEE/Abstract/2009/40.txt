Harmonic volumetric mapping aims to establish a smooth bijective correspondence between two solid shapes with the same topology. In this paper;  we develop an automatic meshless method for creating such a mapping between two given objects. With the shell surface mapping as the boundary condition;  we first solve a linear system constructed by a boundary method called the \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>method</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>of</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>fundamental</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>solution</i>\n;  and then represent the mapping using a set of points with different weights in the vicinity of the shell of the given model. Our algorithm is a true meshless method (without the need of any specific meshing structure within the solid interior) and the behavior of the interior region is directly determined by the boundary;  which can improve the computational efficiency and robustness significantly. Therefore;  our algorithm can be applied to massive volume data sets with various geometric primitives and topological types. We demonstrate the utility and efficacy of our algorithm in information transfer;  shape registration;  deformation sequence analysis;  tetrahedral remeshing;  and solid texture synthesis.
