Manufacturing systems are often subject to resource failure. In past work;  we developed ldquorobustrdquo supervisory controllers for the single-unit resource allocation model. These guarantee that if any subset of resources fail;  parts in the system requiring failed resources do not block the production of parts not requiring failed resources. To establish supervisor correctness;  we assumed that each part type required at most one unreliable resource in its route. We now relax this assumption using a central buffer and present supervisors that guarantee robust operation without assumptions on route structure.
