A weighting restriction with frequency components is proposed for the insulin delivery on Type 1 Diabetics Mellitus (T1DM) towards the control of the blood glucose level. The weighting restriction is stated from a model of healthy subjects which includes a rate for insulin delivery. The frequency components are incorporated via a transfer function from the plasma glucose to the free-plasma insulin such that a \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>H</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>infin</sub>\n-based controller is designed. In this way;  the control synthesis involves the frequency components on which a healthy pancreas delivers insulin for the glucose homeostasis. In order to test controller performance;  a dynamical model of an actuator is also included in the closed-loop system to add its effects in the closed-loop evaluation of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>H</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>infin</sub>\n -based controller. The actuator is a pump to deliver of an insulin infusion according with the rate computed by the controller. Note that the contribution is particularly focused on T1DM; however;  the inclusion of weighting restriction can be used also onto critical care conditions.
