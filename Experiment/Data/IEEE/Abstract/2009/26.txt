This paper considers the problem of container inspection at a port-of-entry. Containers are inspected through a specific sequence to detect the presence of nuclear materials;  biological and chemical agents;  and other illegal shipments. The threshold levels of sensors at inspection stations of the port-of-entry affect the probabilities of incorrectly accepting or rejecting a container. In this paper;  we present several optimization approaches for determining the optimum sensor threshold levels;  while considering misclassification errors;  total cost of inspection;  and budget constraints. In contrast to previous work which determines threshold levels and sequence separately;  we consider an integrated system and determine them simultaneously. Examples applying the approaches in different sensor arrangements are demonstrated.
