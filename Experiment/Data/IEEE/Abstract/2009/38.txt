Self replication is a kind of self-assembly in which a desired structure is obtained automatically from simple parts. We propose self-replication not by controlling the parts directly;  but by controlling their environment;  namely passive self-replication;  which makes self-replicating structures by imitating the semi-conservative replication of DNA. The proposed self-replication strategy is available for multiple types of parts by introducing selective surface structures on parts and two different bonding forces.
