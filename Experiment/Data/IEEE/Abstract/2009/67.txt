Developable surfaces have many desired properties in the manufacturing process. Since most existing CAD systems utilize tensor-product parametric surfaces including B-splines as design primitives;  there is a great demand in industry to convert a general free-form parametric surface within a prescribed global error bound into developable patches. In this paper;  we propose a practical and efficient solution to approximate a rectangular parametric surface with a small set of \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>C</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>0</sup>\n -joint developable strips. The key contribution of the proposed algorithm is that;  several optimization problems are elegantly solved in a sequence that offers a controllable global error bound on the developable surface approximation. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed algorithm.
