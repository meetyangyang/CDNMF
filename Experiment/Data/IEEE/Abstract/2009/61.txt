This paper addresses a novel method for localizing a stationary object in an indoor office environment. The proposed method utilizes the received-signal-strength index (RSSI) of radio signals radiating from fixed reference nodes and reference tags placed at known positions to generate a precise signal propagation model. Signal attenuation parameters are updated online according to environmental variation; thus;  the proposed method has environmental-adaptation capabilities. Subsequent experiments were conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over a commercial location-based service (LBS) chipset.
