B-spline multiplication;  that is;  finding the coefficients of the product B-spline of two given B-splines is useful as an end result;  in addition to being an important prerequisite component to many other symbolic computation operations on B-splines. Algorithms for B-spline multiplication standardly use indirect approaches such as nodal interpolation or computing the product of each set of polynomial pieces using various bases. The original direct approach is complicated. B-spline blossoming provides another direct approach that can be straightforwardly translated from mathematical equation to implementation; however;  the algorithm does not scale well with degree or dimension of the subject tensor product B-splines. To addresses the difficulties mentioned heretofore;  we present the sliding windows algorithm (SWA);  a new blossoming based algorithm for the multiplication of two B-spline curves;  two B-spline surfaces;  or any two general multivariate B-splines.
