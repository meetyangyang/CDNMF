In this paper;  we propose a new algorithm for dynamic calibration of multiple cameras. Based on the mapping between a horizontal plane in the 3-D space and the 2-D image plane on a panned and tilted camera;  we utilize the displacement of feature points and the epipolar-plane constraint among multiple cameras to infer the changes of pan and tilt angles for each camera. This algorithm does not require a complicated correspondence of feature points. It can be applied to surveillance systems with wide-range coverage. It also allows the presence of moving objects in the captured scenes while performing dynamic calibration. The sensitivity analysis of our algorithm with respect to measurement errors and fluctuations in previous estimations is also discussed. The efficiency and feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in some experiments over real scenery.
