In a conventional CNC system;  communications between the motion controller and the analogue servo driver usually take place in a unidirectional manner;  i.e.;  from the controller to the driver. In order to increase the interoperability level between the motion controller and the driver;  Fieldbus is used in this research. The digital servo in a Fieldbus-based system enables applications with all servo loops closed. Functions that have been traditionally executed by the motion controller can now be shifted to the driver. In this research;  the traditional CNC system has been redesigned based on the component technology. Following the analysis of the architecture of a traditional CNC and the features of a Fieldbus;  component models have been developed for the motion controller and the driver. This Fieldbus-based CNC system gives the much-needed interoperability between the motion controller and the driver. A comparative experiment based on a four-axis CNC system has been carried out to showcase the component model-based system.
