This paper describes a concerted effort to design and implement a robotic service framework. The proposed framework is comprised of three conceptual spaces: physical;  semantic;  and virtual spaces;  collectively referred to as a ubiquitous robotic space. We implemented a prototype robotic security application in an office environment;  which confirmed that the proposed framework is an efficient tool for developing a robotic service employing IT infrastructure;  particularly for integrating heterogeneous technologies and robotic platforms.
