This paper presents an automated cell contour visual measurement technique and a data synchronization mechanism for real-time;  high-accuracy mechanical characterization of individual cells with micropipette aspiration. A computer vision tracking algorithm is developed for automatically measuring cell deformation parameters in real time (30 Hz) with a resolution down to 0.21 pixel;  significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of micropipette aspiration. To achieve a high characterization accuracy;  the cell deformations and applied pressure changes are precisely synchronized using a data synchronization mechanism. Experimental results on both solid-like cells (interstitial cells) and liquid-like cells (neutrophils) quantitatively demonstrate that the visual tracking algorithm is capable of significantly increasing the efficiency and accuracy of micropipette aspiration. Among several characterized mechanical parameters;  the viscoelastic properties of porcine aortic valve interstitial cells were;  for the first time;  quantified in this study.
