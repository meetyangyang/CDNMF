The task of decentralized decision-making involves interaction of a set of local decision-makers;  each of which operates under limited sensing capabilities and is thus subjected to ambiguity during the process of decision-making. In our prior work;  we made a key observation that such ambiguities are of differing gradations and presented a framework for inferencing over varying ambiguity levels to arrive at local and global control decisions. We develop a similar framework for performing diagnosis in a decentralized setting. For each event-trace executed by a system being monitored;  each local diagnoser issues its own diagnosis decision (failure or nonfailure or unsure);  tagged with a certain ambiguity level (zero being the minimum). A global diagnosis decision is taken to be a ldquowinningrdquo local diagnosis decision;  i.e.;  one with a minimum ambiguity level. The computation of an ambiguity level for a local decision requires an assessment of the self-ambiguity as well as the ambiguities of the others;  and an inference based up on such knowledge. In order to characterize the class of systems for which any fault can be detected within a uniformly bounded number of steps (or ldquodelayrdquo);  we introduce the notion of \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>N</i>\n -inference-diagnosability for Failures (also called \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>N</i>\n-inference F-diagnosability);  where the index \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>N</i>\n represents the maximum ambiguity level of any winning local decision. We show that the codiagnosability introduced in is the same as 0-inference F-diagnosability; the conditional F-codiagnosability introduced in ;  is a type of 1-inference F-diagnosability; the class of higher-index inference F-diagnosable systems strictly subsumes the class of lower-index ones; and the class of inference F-diagnosable systems is strictly subsumed by the class of systems that are centrally F-diagnosable.
