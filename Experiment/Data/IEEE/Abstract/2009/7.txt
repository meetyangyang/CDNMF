Generally;  object recognition in robotics has used vision;  sonar;  laser range sensors;  etc. In this paper;  the authors propose a new sensing technology based on radio frequency identification (RFID) to facilitate the autonomous recognition of objects. This technology uses a novel tag;  named the 3-D tag;  with which an object can be identified and its orientation together with location can be estimated. This paper presents the method for object recognition by analyzing the characteristics of the 3-D tag;  and then validates the 3-D tag through several demonstrations showing its usefulness as an independent sensor for recognizing objects.
