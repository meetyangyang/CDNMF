Radio-frequency identification (RFID) poses a number of research challenges;  such as interference mitigation;  throughput optimization and security over the RF channel. A number of new approaches to address these issues have been proposed recently;  but due to the highly integrated nature of passive RFID tags;  it is difficult to evaluate them in real-world scenarios. In this paper;  we present an RFID simulation engine;  RFIDSim;  which implements the ISO 18000-6C communication protocol and supports pathloss;  fading;  backscatter;  capture;  and tag mobility models. This paper also shows that our implementation of RFIDSim that relies on a discrete event simulator can be used to simulate large populations featuring thousands of RFID tags. RFIDSim also simulates the deep fades that lead to frequent power losses of the battery-less RFID tags by modeling the multipath effects statistically.
