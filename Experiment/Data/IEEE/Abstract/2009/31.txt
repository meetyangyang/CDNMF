Lighting control systems provide various benefits in building management;  and building automation and control network (BACnet) is an international standard data communication protocol for building automation and control networks. We introduce a reference model for BACnet-based lighting control systems and evaluate its performance using an experimental model. The experimental results show that the system can reduce the energy consumption for lighting loads by 40%. Stable operation of the control system is guaranteed below a certain threshold of network traffic.
