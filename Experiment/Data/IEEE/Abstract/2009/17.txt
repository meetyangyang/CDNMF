Next-generation gas metal arc welding (GMAW) machines require the rapid metal transfer process be accurately monitored using a high-speed vision system and be feedback controlled. However;  the necessity for high frame rate reduces the resolution achievable and bright welding arc makes it difficult to clearly image the metal transfer process. Processing of images for real-time monitoring of metal transfer process is thus challenging. To address this challenge;  the authors analyzed the characteristics of metal transfer images in a novel modification of GMAW;  referred to as double-electrode GMAW;  and proposed an algorithm consisting of a system of effective steps to extract the needed droplet feedback information from high frame rate low-resolution metal transfer images. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in automatically locating the droplet and computing the droplet size with an adequate accuracy.
