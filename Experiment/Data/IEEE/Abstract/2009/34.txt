We introduce the notion of \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>safe-codiagnosability</i>\n;  extending the notion of safe-diagnosability (Paoli and Lafortune;  2005) to the decentralized setting. For a system;  a certain subbehavior is deemed safe (captured via a safety specification);  and a further subbehavior is deemed nonfaulty (captured via a nonfault specification). Safe-codiagnosability requires that when the system executes a trace that is faulty;  there exists at least one diagnoser that can detect this within bounded delay and also before the safety specification is violated. The above notion of safe-codiagnosability may also be viewed as an extension of the notion of codiagnosability (Qiu and Kumar;  2006);  where the latter did not have any safety requirement. We show that safe-codiagnosability is equivalent to codiagnosability together with ldquozero-delay codiagnosabilityrdquo of ldquoboundary safe tracesrdquo. (A safe trace is a boundary safe trace if there exists a single-event extension that is unsafe.) We give an algorithm of polynomial complexity for verifying safe-codiagnosability. For a safe-codiagnosable system;  the same methods as those proposed in (Qiu and Kumar;  2006) can be applied for offline synthesis of individual diagnosers;  as well as for online diagnosis using them.
