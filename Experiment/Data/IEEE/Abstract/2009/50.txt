Biological studies;  drug discovery;  and medical diagnostics benefit greatly from automated microscope platforms that can outperform even the most skilled human operators in certain tasks. However;  the small field-of-view of a traditional microscope operating at high resolution poses a significant challenge in practice. The common approach of using a moving stage suffers from relatively low dynamic bandwidth and agitation to the specimen. This paper describes an automated microscope station based on the novel adaptive scanning optical microscope (ASOM);  which combines a high-speed post-objective scanning mirror;  a custom design scanner lens;  and a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) deformable mirror to achieve a greatly expanded field-of-view. After describing the layout and operating principle of the ASOM imaging subsystem;  we present a system architecture for an automated microscope system suitable for the ASOM's unique wide field and high-speed imaging capabilities. We then describe a low-cost experimental prototype of the ASOM that demonstrates all critical optical characteristics of the instrument;  including the calibration of the MEMS deformable mirror. Finally;  we present initial biological (living nematode worms) imaging results obtained with the experimental apparatus and discuss the impact of the ASOM on biomedical imaging activities.
