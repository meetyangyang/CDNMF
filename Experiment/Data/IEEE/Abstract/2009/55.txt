In this paper;  we are concerned with the registration of two 3D data sets with large-scale stretches and noises. First;  by incorporating a scale factor into the standard iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm;  we formulate the registration into a constraint optimization problem over a 7D nonlinear space. Then;  we apply the singular value decomposition (SVD) approach to iteratively solving such optimization problem. Finally;  we establish a new ICP algorithm;  named Scale-ICP algorithm;  for registration of the data sets with isotropic stretches. In order to achieve global convergence for the proposed algorithm;  we propose a way to select the initial registrations. To demonstrate the performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm;  we give several comparative experiments between Scale-ICP algorithm and the standard ICP algorithm.
