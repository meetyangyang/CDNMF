In this paper;  a vision-based impedance control algorithm is proposed to regulate the cell injection force;  based on dynamic modeling conducted on a laboratory test-bed cell injection system. The injection force is initially calibrated to derive the relationship between the force and the cell deformation utilizing a cell membrane point-load model. To increase the success rate of injection;  the injector is positioned out of the focal plane of the camera;  used to obtain visual feedback for the injection process. In this out-of-plane injection process;  the total cell membrane deformation is estimated;  based on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>X</i>\n-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>Y</i>\n coordinate frame deformation of the cell;  as measured with a microscope;  and the known angle between the injector and the \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>X</i>\n-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>Y</i>\n plane. Further;  a relationship between the injection force and the injector displacement of the cell membrane;  as observed with the camera;  is derived. Based on this visual force estimation scheme;  an impedance control algorithm is developed. Experimental results of the proposed injection method are given which validate the approach.
