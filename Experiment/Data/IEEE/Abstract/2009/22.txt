This paper describes a dynamics modeling and control strategy of a chemo-electro-mechanical process for electroporation-mediated gene delivery. By extending the results in the open literature;  a control-enabled dynamics model of the gene-delivery process is proposed. Based on the dynamics model;  a model-based state feedback control strategy is proposed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of the proposed method.
