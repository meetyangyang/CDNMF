This paper presents a complete design and development procedure of a new XY micromanipulator for two-dimensional (2-D) micromanipulation applications. The manipulator possesses both a nearly decoupled motion and a simple structure;  which is featured with parallel-kinematic architecture;  flexure hinge-based joints;  and piezoelectric actuation. Based on pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) simplification approach;  the mathematical models predicting kinematics;  statics;  and dynamics of the XY stage have been obtained;  which are verified by the finite-element analysis (FEA) and then integrated into dimension optimization via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Moreover;  a prototype of the micromanipulator is fabricated and calibrated using a microscope vision system;  and visual servo control employing a modified PD controller is implemented for the accuracy improvement. The experiments discover that a workspace size of 260 mum times 260 mum with a 2-D positioning accuracy and repeatability around 0.73 and 1.02 mum;  respectively;  can be achieved by the micromanipulator.
