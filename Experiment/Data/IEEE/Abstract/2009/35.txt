This paper presents the design and implementation of a neurofuzzy system for modeling and control of a high-performance drilling process in a networked application. The neurofuzzy system considered in this work is an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS);  where fuzzy rules are obtained from input/output data. The design of the control system is based on the internal model control paradigm. The results obtained are significant both in simulation as well as the real-time application of networked control of the cutting force during high-performance drilling processes.
