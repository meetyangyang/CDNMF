The distribution of a limited rate of high-pressure gas to gas-lifted wells;  while respecting injection bounds and activation precedence constraints;  consists of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear formulation obtained by piecewise-linearizing the nonlinear functions;  thereby allowing the use of integer programming algorithms. Valid inequalities for the convex hull of feasible solutions are derived from knapsack covers;  for which exact and approximate lifting procedures yield stronger inequalities. Numerical results show that these cover-based cuts reduce the number of nodes explored in a branch-and-bound search.
