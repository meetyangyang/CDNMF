During a highly productive period running from 1995 to about 2002;  the research in lossless compression of surface meshes mainly consisted in a hard battle for the best bitrates. However;  for a few years;  compression rates seem stabilized around 1.5 bit per vertex for the connectivity coding of usual triangular meshes;  and more and more work is dedicated to remeshing;  lossy compression;  or gigantic mesh compression;  where memory access and CPU optimizations are the new priority. However;  the size of 3D models keeps growing;  and many application fields keep requiring lossless compression. In this paper;  we present a new contribution for single-rate lossless connectivity compression;  which first brings improvement over current state of the art bitrates;  and second;  does not constraint the coding of the vertex positions;  offering therefore a good complementarity with the best performing geometric compression methods. The initial observation having motivated this work is that very often;  most of the connectivity part of a mesh can be automatically deduced from its geometric part using reconstruction algorithms. This has already been used within the limited framework of projectable objects (essentially;  terrain models and GIS);  but finds here its first generalization to arbitrary triangular meshes;  without any limitation regarding the topological genus;  the number of connected components;  the manifoldness or the regularity. This can be obtained by constraining and guiding a Delaunay-based reconstruction algorithm so that it outputs the initial mesh to be coded. The resulting rates seem extremely competitive when the meshes are fully included in Delaunay;  and are still good compared to the state-of-the-art in the case of scanned models.
