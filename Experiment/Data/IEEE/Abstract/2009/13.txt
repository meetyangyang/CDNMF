This paper considers regularity analysis for patterned texture material inspection. Patterned texture-like fabric is built on a repetitive unit of a pattern. Regularity is one of the most important features in many textures. In this paper;  a new patterned texture inspection approach called the regular bands (RB) method is described. First;  the properties of textures and the meaning of regularity measurements are presented. Next;  traditional regularity analysis for patterned textures is introduced. Many traditional approaches such as co-occurrence matrices;  autocorrelation;  traditional image subtraction and hash function are based on the concept of periodicity. These approaches have been applied for image retrieval;  image synthesis;  and defect detection of patterned textures. In this paper;  a new measure of periodicity for patterned textures is described. The Regular Bands method is based on the idea of periodicity. A detailed description of the RB method with definitions;  procedures;  and explanations is given. There is also a detailed evaluation using the Regular Bands of some patterned textures. Three kinds of patterned fabric samples are used in the evaluation and a high detection success rate is achieved. Finally;  there is a discussion of the method and some conclusions.
