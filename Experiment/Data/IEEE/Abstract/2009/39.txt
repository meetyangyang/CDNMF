Arrangements of planar curves are fundamental structures in computational geometry. The arrangement package of Cgal can construct and maintain arrangements of various families of curves;  when provided with the representation of the curves and some basic geometric functionality on them. It employs the exact computation paradigm in order to handle all degenerate cases in a robust manner. We present the representations and algorithms needed for implementing arrangements of Bezier curves using exact arithmetic. The implementation is efficient and complete;  handling all degenerate cases. In order to avoid the prohibitive running times incurred by an indiscriminate usage of exact arithmetic;  we make extensive use of the geometric properties of Bezier curves for filtering. As a result;  most operations are carried out using fast approximate methods;  and only in degenerate (or near-degenerate) cases do we resort to the exact;  and more computationally demanding;  procedures. To the best of our knowledge this is the first complete implementation that can construct arrangements of Bezier curves of any degree;  and handle all degenerate cases in a robust manner.
