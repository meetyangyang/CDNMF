This paper proposes a new and more efficient solution to the problem of determining optimal form-closure constraints of polygonal objects using four contacts. New grasp parameters are determined based only on the directions of the applied forces;  which are then used to determine the optimal grasp. Given a set of contact edges;  using an analytical procedure a solution that is either the optimal one or is very close to it is obtained (only in this second case an iterative procedure is needed to find a root of a nonlinear equation). This procedure is used for an efficient determination of the optimal grasp on the whole object. The algorithms have been implemented and numerical examples are shown.
