This paper presents the design of a new compact one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) compliant stage driven by a piezoelectric actuator (PEA) for micro/nanopositioning in the vertical direction. An orthogonal compound bridge-type amplifier is introduced to amplify the displacement of the PEA. It significantly reduces the height of the stage and leads to a compact design. By analytical modeling of the mechanism;  the design variables are determined;  which are then optimized via the multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the finite-element analysis. Simulation results show that the 1-DOF stage is able to provide the maximum displacement of 181.18 μm in theory;  which is more than 12 × the input displacement of PEA. Payload test results indicate that the stage can support a maximum load of about 80 N. Comparison study reveals that the presented vertical positioning stage offers a more compact structure than existing ones. A prototype is fabricated for experimental studies;  and the deviation between the experimental and simulation results is discussed in detail. Moreover;  closed-loop performance test exhibits a resolution of 10 nm for the developed vertical positioning stage.
