This paper proposes a dynamic analytics method based on the least squares support vector machine with a hybrid kernel to address real-time prediction problems in the converter steelmaking process. The hybrid kernel function is used to enhance the performance of the existing kernels. To improve the model's accuracy;  the internal parameters are optimized by a differential evolution algorithm. In light of the complex mechanisms of the converter steelmaking process;  a multistage modeling strategy is designed instead of the traditional single-stage modeling method. Owing to the dynamic nature of the practical production process;  great effort has been made to construct a dynamic model that uses the prediction error information based on the static model. The validity of the proposed method is verified through experiments on real-world data collected from a basic oxygen furnace steelmaking process. The results indicate that the proposed method can successfully solve dynamic prediction problems and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.
