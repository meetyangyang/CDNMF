Mathematical models are often required in process modeling;  control;  and evaluation. To meet the increasing demand of production system real-time performance evaluation and improvement;  in this paper: 1) an innovative event-based;  data-driven mathematical model is established for network structured manufacturing systems; 2) important properties of network structured manufacturing systems are obtained through the concept development of a virtual ideal clean system; and 3) a system performance diagnostic method is developed based on the mathematical model and system properties;  as well as available sensor data. The mathematical model and system performance identification methodology are studied analytically and validated by simulation studies. This data-driven mathematical framework and system real-time performance diagnostic methodology are invaluable for real-time production control to improve system responsiveness and efficiency.
