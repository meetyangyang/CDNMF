The prediction accuracy of the traditional kernel with data-driven regression methods strongly depends on the appropriate selection of the kernel function and aims at solving the nonlinearity of the input space. In this paper;  a self-learning kernel regression model is proposed. A special kernel space from the measured data is learned and designed;  so that combined with dimension reductions on the input variables;  the regression behavior between the projected input variables and the output variable is found. The model is posed as a semidefinite programming problem with the objective function to find the maximum variance between the learned manifolds. The kernel is data dependent and can be generated online whenever a new data point is available. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through the case studies on a simple nonlinear system and a real semiconductor process.
