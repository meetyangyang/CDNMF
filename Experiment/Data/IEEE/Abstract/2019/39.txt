Time-phased sensor-network deployment refers to the delivery of a set of sensors to their predetermined locations at exact times by a fleet of vehicles. Applications for such network deployments include wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR) and wildfire monitoring;  where desirable resource management would imply allowing the vehicles to perform other tasks between deliveries. The goal of this paper is;  thus;  to formulate and solve a vehicle-routing problem (VRP) for such just-in-time time-phased sensor-network deployments. The proposed optimization method for the modified VRP outlined herein has two primary novelties: 1) the consideration of spare time as the objective function and 2) the use of a targeted local-search (LS) method. The spare-time objective function was formulated to address the uniqueness of the modified routing problem at hand. The targeted LS algorithm;  on the other hand;  was developed to tangibly improve the efficiency of the search for the optimal values of the chosen objective function. The proposed vehicle-route-planning method was validated via a range of simulated WiSAR scenarios;  some of which are included herein. The robustness of the method to variations in problem parameters was also investigated.
