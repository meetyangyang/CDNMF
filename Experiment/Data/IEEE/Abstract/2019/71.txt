In this paper;  a hierarchical hybrid motion/force control architecture for the manipulation and grasping of mobile manipulators is presented;  where the systems are subject to varieties of physical constraints such as Coulomb friction cones;  nonholonomic/holonomic constraints;  and actuator saturation limits. The incorporation of a projection-based operation space control and an adaptive controller based on the neural networks used in this paper formulates a novel control scheme;  so the system stability is further guaranteed and the uncertain dynamics is handled without redesigning the minimal-order dynamics model. Considering the effects of these constraints;  the actuator saturation limits are handled by an auxiliary designed system;  and the neural dynamics optimization is applied for the quadratically constrained programing problem of the optimal robotic grasping. The dynamic uncertainties can be estimated online by using the developed motion/force control strategy;  and the application of a novel disturbance observer is explored to ensure the good tracking performance. The experimental results are presented to verify the performance and the efficiency of the proposed method.
