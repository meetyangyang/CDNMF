With growing environmental and sustainability-related concerns;  recovery optimization of mechanical products has been gaining increased exposure. It facilitates environmental sustainability through the improvement in the life-cycle material efficiency and reduction in environmental impact with disassembly sequence planning;  component reuse;  and material recycling. Traditional product recovery separates end-of-life (EOL) products into components and selects EOL options of components. However;  there are many practical cases in which the recovery of a set of subassemblies and components leads to better net revenue than that of a complete set of single components. This paper proposes to model and optimize hybrid disassembly and EOL operations of product recovery to maximize the recovery profit and minimize the environmental impact. Flexible process planning of hybrid disassembly determines a disassembly level by identifying the reusability of subassemblies and disassembly sequences mixed with subassemblies and components. Optimal EOL decisions for each subassembly and component are investigated such that the economic and environmental objectives can be achieved. Finally;  a case study is described to illustrate the proposed method and the influence on decision variables of the tradeoff between the recovery profit and environmental impact is discussed.
