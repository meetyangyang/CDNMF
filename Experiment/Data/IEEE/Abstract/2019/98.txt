When changes are performed on an automated production system (aPS);  new faults can be accidentally introduced into the system;  which are called regressions. A common method for finding these faults is regression testing. In most cases;  this regression testing process is performed under high time pressure and onsite in a very uncomfortable environment. Until now;  there has been no automated support for finding and prioritizing system test cases regarding the fully integrated aPS that are suitable for finding regressions. Thus;  the testing technician has to rely on personal intuition and experience;  possibly choosing an inappropriate order of test cases;  finding regressions at a very late stage of the test run. Using a suitable prioritization;  this iterative process of finding and fixing regressions can be streamlined and a lot of time can be saved by executing test cases likely to identify new regressions earlier. Thus;  an approach is presented in this paper that uses previously acquired runtime data from past test executions and performs a change identification and impact analysis to prioritize test cases that have a high probability to unveil regressions caused by side effects of a system change. The approach was developed in cooperation with reputable industrial partners active in the field of aPS engineering;  ensuring a development in line with industrial requirements. An industrial case study and an expert evaluation were performed;  showing promising results.
