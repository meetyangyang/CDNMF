Change point detection in torque signals has widely been adopted for quality inspection during pipe tightening processes. Previous studies on the change point detection in this process generally focus on directly detecting the change points throughout torques without considering the underlying mechanism that generates various quasi-periodic nonlinear profiles;  thereby introducing a series of false change points and increasing the risk of releasing defective pipes. To overcome this problem;  we propose a novel change-point detection approach by fully considering the profile generating mechanism;  and introduce a similarity-weighted matrix with an integration of dynamic time warping and tightening physics. Thus;  the probability of false detection of change points is reduced. A weighted regression model is developed to determine the authentic change points by introducing the tightening process constraints. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by both numerical and real case studies;  and results show that the proposed method achieves a more effective detection power than the other existing methods in the pipe tightening processes.
