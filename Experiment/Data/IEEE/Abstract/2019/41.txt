In this paper;  we propose a recursive algorithm to estimate the process variance in multistage manufacturing or assembly processes. We use a replicated model that includes the process variance to be estimated as a time-varying state that changes slowly. For this model;  we develop an estimation strategy including tuning parameters that play a direct role in the tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and the adaptation to changes. We also develop a statistical confidence interval for the estimations which enhances the decision of whether the process variances have changed. Unlike other batch methods in the literature;  our proposal is computed recursively;  and it allows us to tune the tradeoff between the convergence speed and the accuracy without modifying the sample size;  which only contains the data of the last manufactured piece. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
