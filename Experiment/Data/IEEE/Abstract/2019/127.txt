For the traditional three-axis configuration of additive manufacturing (AM) platform;  it is imperative to construct adequate support structures prior to the fabrication of overhanging features on the part geometry. To completely eliminate the use of support by taking advantage of the newly emerged five-axis AM platform;  a novel multidirectional process planning algorithm for 3 + 2-axis AM is proposed in this paper. The core of the strategy is to decompose the model into support-free parts directly pertaining to the cusp-height constraint;  each with its own build direction. The nozzle will follow the staged sequence to fabricate each individual part along its build direction;  as facilitated by the adjustable orientation of the nozzle head on a five-axis platform. For model decomposition;  a recursive downward flooding expansion algorithm is introduced to identify a surface patch in accordance with the support-free criteria. After being stitched as a watertight geometry;  the decomposed part together with the remaining part will be archived into a prescribed hierarchy based on which the build sequence is readily established. Preliminary testing results have verified the effectiveness of the algorithm to handle the geometries of different types.
