This paper introduces a systematical interval-based framework of inherent uncertainties and pose evaluation for a class of soft continuum robots driven by flexible shafts. A more general model of continuum robots driven by shaft tendons is extended from prior kinematic models. On top of the proposed model;  the interval-based analysis is presented to analyze and characterize the pose of continuum robots considering uncertainties in kinematic parameters and joint inputs. A 3-D printed bending actuator driven by a flexible shaft is evaluated for case study based on the proposed interval-valued framework. This paper investigates and compares a couple of refinement methods and proposes a new way of sensitivity analysis of model parameters based on interval arithmetic. The kinematic and mechanics parameters are measured and identified experimentally with a representation of intervals. The in-plane motion experiment validates that the computed bounds can enclose all the measured tip positions with consideration of the measurement uncertainty. The method is also validated when external loading is exerted.
