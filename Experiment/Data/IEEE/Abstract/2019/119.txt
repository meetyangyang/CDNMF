Modern datacenters rely on virtualization to deliver complex and scalable cloud services. To avoid inflating costs or reducing the perceived service level;  suitable resource optimization techniques are needed. Placement can be used to prevent inefficient maps between virtual and physical machines. In this perspective;  we propose a holistic placement framework considering conflicting performance metrics;  such as the service level delivered by the cloud;  the energetic footprint;  hardware or software outages;  and security policies. Unfortunately;  computing the best placement strategies is nontrivial;  as it requires the ability to trade among several goals;  possibly in a real-time manner. Therefore;  we approach the problem via model predictive control to devise optimal maps between virtual and physical machines. Results show the effectiveness of our technique in comparison with classical heuristics.
