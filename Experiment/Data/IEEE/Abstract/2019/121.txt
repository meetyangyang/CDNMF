In this paper;  heading reference-assisted pose estimation (HRPE) has been proposed to compensate inherent drift of visual odometry (VO) on ground vehicles;  where an estimation error is prone to grow while the vehicle is making turns or in environments with poor features. By introducing a particular orientation as “heading reference; ” a pose estimation framework has been presented to incorporate measurements from heading reference sensors into VO. A graph formulation is then proposed to represent the pose estimation problem under the commonly used graph optimization model. Simulations and experiments on KITTI data set and our self-collected sequences have been conducted to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme. KITTI sequences and manually generated heading measurement with Gaussian noises are used in simulation;  where rotational drift error is observed to be bounded. Compared with a pure VO;  the proposed approach greatly reduces average translational localization error from 153.85 to 24.29 m and 23.80 m in self-collected stereo visual sequences with traveling distance over 4.5 km at the processing rates of 19.7 and 11.1 Hz;  for the loosely coupled and tightly coupled models;  respectively.
