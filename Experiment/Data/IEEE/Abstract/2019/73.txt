Human-powered lower exoskeletons have received considerable interests from both academia and industry over the past decades;  and encountered increasing applications in human locomotion assistance and strength augmentation. One of the most important aspects in those applications is to achieve robust control of lower exoskeletons;  which;  in the first place;  requires the proactive modeling of human movement trajectories through physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). As a powerful representative tool for motion trajectories;  dynamic movement primitives (DMP) have been used to model human movement trajectories. However;  canonical DMP only offers a general representation of human movement trajectory and may neglects the interactive term;  therefore it cannot be directly applied to lower exoskeletons which need to track human joint trajectories online;  because different pilots have different trajectories and even same pilot might change his/her motion during walking. This paper presents a novel coupled cooperative primitive (CCP) strategy;  which aims at modeling the motion trajectories online. Besides maintaining canonical motion primitives;  we model the interaction term between the pilot and exoskeletons through impedance models;  and propose a reinforcement learning method based on policy improvement and path integrals (PI\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n) to learn the parameters online. Experimental results on both a single degree-of-freedom platform and a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX) system demonstrate the advantages of our proposed CCP scheme.
