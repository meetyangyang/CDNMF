In recent years;  imbalanced utilization of medical resources is widely concerned within the tiered Chinese hospital system. Reverse referral;  as a measure of promoting patient flows from upper level hospitals (ULHs) to lower level hospitals (LLHs);  has demonstrated its advantages on alleviating ULH workload and balancing resource utilization between ULHs and LLHs. Nevertheless;  it remains unclear on how to control the reverse referral decision process at the operational level. In this paper;  we consider an ULH-dominant setting at which the LLH must accept patient referrals from the ULH whenever it has available beds. We focus our attention on an easy-to-implement threshold policy for the ULH to make the reverse referral decision. To investigate;  we first formulate an analytically tractable queueing model for a simplified reverse referral process. We then investigate a more general patient flow control model;  for which we analyze the patient population dynamics with a Markov chain process;  and apply the concept of state-dependent Markovian arrival process to generate an infinitesimal generator of the system. We use RG factorization to compute the system performance measures. We next formulate a threshold optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the ULH profit. Simulation experiments are performed;  which conclude that the threshold control policy is insensitive to the service time distribution. Finally;  we report real-world inspired numerical studies;  from which we generate insights into effective adjustment of the control threshold in response to the system parameters and discuss potential hindrance from the LLH incorrectly informing its real-time resource availability to the ULH. Our work is the first that applies systems engineering to the real-time reverse referral decision problem in China. It provides the novel perspective of resource balancing to patient flow control studies in the care transition management literature.
