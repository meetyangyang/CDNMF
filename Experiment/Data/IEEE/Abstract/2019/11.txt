This paper investigates the deployment issue of an emergency medical service (EMS) system to maintain the preferred service coverages under different considerations. Specifically;  two coverage levels are introduced to reflect the requirements under the regular situation and the situation with ambulance unavailable. We propose the two-stage robust optimization (RO) models to design a reliable ambulance system subject to unavailability of the ambulances;  with and without the ambulance relocation. For the RO problem with mixed-integer recourse for relocation;  we customize the column and constraint generation method with an approximation strategy to handle the computational challenge. Our numerical study: 1) demonstrates that our RO formulations have a strong modeling capacity on designing the EMS system; 2) shows that our approximation algorithm performs very well; and 3) provides a quantitative evaluation of;  including;  relocation operations on the system performance.
