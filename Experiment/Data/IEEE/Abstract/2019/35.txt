The handling of ultrathin wafers (<;100 Î¼m thickness) is a challenging task since these are among the thinnest and most fragile materials. This paper provides a soft-acting and noncontact gripping technology for ultrathin wafer based on the distributed Bernoulli principle;  and also proposes an experimental measurement method for evaluating the performance. A distributed Bernoulli gripper for ultrathin wafers is designed;  and the characteristics of the gripper are studied via theoretical analysis and experiments. Three performance indices for evaluating the properties of the soft gripping: deformation;  vibration;  and stress are presented. Through measurement experiments;  the effects of the key operational parameters consisting of air flow rate and gap height on the performance indices are investigated. Based on the experimental data;  the appropriate parameters settings are obtained. The comparison to present grippers reveals that the proposed gripping technology is superior in soft gripping thin and fragile materials. This paper provides guidance for implementing the distributed Bernoulli principle in practical applications of soft-acting and noncontact gripping for thin and fragile materials.
