Hospitals use appointment systems to manage patient access. Appointment rule;  which consists of the length of the booking window;  block capacity;  and block service time;  is critical to achieve efficiency and timely access to healthcare delivery. In this paper;  we use a renewal process model to evaluate interday appointment planning and design improved appointment rules for hospitals;  especially for those with limited or insufficient resources. We present an associated embedded Markov chain to derive the steady-state distribution. To balance the waiting time and probability of healthcare access;  we propose three performance measures;  namely;  slot utilization;  appointment success rate;  and patient waiting time;  for our evaluation. We then conduct a numerical study to examine the impact of each appointment rule parameter. Qualitative results show that extending the booking window does not significantly reduce system congestion;  and a narrowed appointment block is a suitable design for highly in-demand doctors. We use our model and method to design an optimal appointment rule for an actual hospital in Beijing;  China. The improved appointment rule is practical and useful for the decision-making of hospital managers.
