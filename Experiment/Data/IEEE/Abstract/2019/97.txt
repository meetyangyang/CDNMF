Manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLOs) has potential applications in the fields of aerospace and automotive assembly. In this paper;  we introduce a problem formulation for attaching a set of interlinked DLOs to a support structure using a set of clamping points. The formulation describes the manipulation planning problem in terms of known clamp poses; predetermined ideal clamping locations on the cables;  called “reference points;” and a set of finite gripping points on the DLOs. We also present a prototype algorithm that generates a solution in terms of primitive manipulation actions. The algorithm guarantees that no interlink constraints are violated at any stage of manipulation. We incorporate gravity in the computation of a DLO shape and propose a property linking geometrically similar cable shapes across the space of cable length and stiffness. This property allows for the computation of solutions for unit length and scaling of these solutions to appropriate length;  potentially resulting in faster shape computation.
