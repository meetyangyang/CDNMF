As the order size for modern fabs tends to be smaller;  fabs wish to process a class of similar wafer lots at a tool concurrently to reduce the work-in-progress lots as well as the total manufacturing lead time. We examine a scheduling problem for a dual-armed cluster tool that simultaneously produces multiple wafer types with identical wafer flow patterns but different process times. We prove that the conventional swap sequence;  which is optimal and prevalently being used for single-wafer-type processing;  is also optimal for such concurrent processing. We then propose a way of determining a release sequence of wafer types into the tool;  called cycle plan;  that maximizes the utilization of parallel chambers and hence increases the tool throughput rate. We present conditions for which the parallel chambers are shared by all wafer types and their workloads are evenly balanced so as to maximize the throughput rate. We also report the experimental results.
