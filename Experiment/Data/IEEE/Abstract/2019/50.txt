Pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs);  a kind of soft/compliant actuators;  have been attracted a great deal of attention in the studies of rehabilitation robots. However;  the nonlinearities;  uncertainties;  hysteresis;  and time-varying features of PMAs bring a lot of difficulties in their high-precision trajectory tracking tasks. In this paper;  an echo state Gaussian process-based nonlinear model predictive control (ESGP-NMPC) is designed for the PMAs. The proposed strategy is comprised of an ESGP;  which is suitable for modeling unknown nonlinear systems as well as measuring their uncertainties;  and a gradient descent optimization algorithm for calculating the control signal sequences. Based on the Lyapunov theorem;  characteristics of the closed-loop system are analyzed to guarantee the asymptotical stability. Both simulations and physical experiments are carried out to illustrate the validity of the proposed control strategy. Compared with other conventional methods;  the ESGP-NMPC can achieve a better model fitting for the PMA and control performance for the high-precision tracking tasks.
