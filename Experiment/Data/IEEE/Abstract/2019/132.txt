Cluster tools;  which consist of processing modules (PMs) and a transport robot;  are used for wafer fabrication processes in semiconductor manufacturing fabs. Once processing of a wafer lot containing several wafers is completed in a tool;  an overhead hoist transport (OHT) unloads the lot and transports it to another tool. Since it is not easy to estimate when a wafer lot is completed;  an OHT is required to wait for the wafer lot to be completed near the tool;  or tools become idle due to the late delivery of wafer lots. To reduce the resulting idle time;  a closed-form expression of the lot completion time is derived;  especially;  for a dual-armed cluster tool consisting of parallel PMs;  to reflect real applications. We even consider lot switching operations where two consecutive wafer lots are processed with an overlap in analyzing the completion time. We finally show that the formulas derived can be used when there are small processing time variations experimentally.
