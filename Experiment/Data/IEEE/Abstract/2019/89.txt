Programming by demonstration (PBD) transforms the robot programming from the code level to automated interface between robot and human;  promoting the flexibility of robotized automation. In this paper;  we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal;  an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill;  called MASD;  is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect;  gesture;  and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD;  the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time;  driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments;  the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills;  and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD;  the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch;  verifying the initial hypothesis.
