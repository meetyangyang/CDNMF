Gas component perception plays an important role of robot for environment detection. The reinforced nonlinear model with update-driven is proposed for gas component perception. When new data are collected;  the update-driven strategy constructs two concatenations to modify the proposed model without using the old data;  where two concatenations are the loading matrices of the old model concatenated to new collected data. Considering the nonlinear characteristics between the independent variables and the dependent variables;  there are two types of the proposed method (TypeI and TypeII). For TypeI;  partial least squares (PLS) is performed on the concatenations;  and the inner linear function of PLS is replaced by the neural network;  where the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) are;  respectively;  employed for TypeI (TypeI-RBFNN and TypeI-BPNN). For TypeII;  the radial basis function network extends the independent variables of the concatenations;  and PLS is performed on the concatenations to extract the nonlinear principle components;  which are the inputs of two feedforward neural networks. The residuals error matrices of the concatenations are;  respectively;  used as the outputs of two feedforward neural networks. Two real experimental data sets;  which are gas-fired plant data set and coal-fired plant data set;  are used for estimating the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can realize gas component perception and TypeI-RBFNN of the proposed method has a better prediction accuracy for different components.
