The objective of this paper is to facilitate the improvement of the control and operation of industrial facilities;  by providing decision support tools. More specifically;  this paper has three main contributions. First;  this paper presents the definition of operation metrics that provide insight into the behavior of: 1) annunciated alarms;  2) alarm floods;  and 3) operator actions in industrial facilities. Second;  this paper presents visualization plots named multilayered radar plots that can present information in an elegant;  dense;  and comprehensive fashion. Three types of plots are proposed;  which collectively compare the behavior of metrics;  variables;  and operation times in industrial facilities. Third;  this paper presents a ranking method and a reordering design procedure of displayed alarms during an alarm flood to reorder the alarms based on the proposed alarm-flood criticality index. The purpose is to provide additional assistance to operators to focus on more critical issues. As the operation metrics;  visualization plots;  and the ranking in alarm floods heavily utilize historized data and given the industrial-oriented application of these decision support tools;  this paper also addresses the extraction of information and the integration of the tools into industrial automation platforms.
