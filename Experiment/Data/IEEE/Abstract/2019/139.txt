Supervisory control theory (SCT) of a discrete-event system (DES) is well developed to find its maximally permissive supervisor. As an extension of SCT;  a new framework;  state-tree structures (STS);  has been deployed to manage the state explosion problem of SCT. The supervisory control with \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>partial observation</i>\n is investigated in SCT;  of which the state explosion issue remains to be explored. This paper dwells upon an approach to the synthesis of supervisory control with partial observation in the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>normal</i>\n STS framework;  requiring that the conjunction of any two projected subpredicates should be false. First;  following the definition of the observability based on STS;  it is proven that there does not exist the supremal observable subpredicate. Second;  we construct a subclass of observable subpredicates of a given predicate (obtained as a specification) on the basis of \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>normal</i>\n STS. Third;  a largest element is proven to exist in the subclass;  and thus a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>weakly controllable;  coreachable;  and observable</i>\n subpredicate is computed to solve the supervisory control problem of the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>normal</i>\n STS by an iterative algorithm. An illustrative example with state size over 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>9</sup>\n is given to show that the proposed algorithm based on STS is superior to the approach based on SCT;  which leads to the program crashes in SCT. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
