Received signal strength (RSS) is a simple and low-cost method of localization in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and is of significant interest in ambient intelligence technologies. However;  RSS-based indoor localization poses important challenges due to the intrinsic characteristics of RSS measurements. This paper proposes a localization approach that accounts for the imperfection of RSS measurements and the reliability of RSS sources to estimate the target node position in an indoor WSN environment. Non-Gaussian probability density functions are used to model RSS deviations more realistically in the context of indoor environments. In addition;  the proposed approach uses the Dempster-Shafer theory to represent and combine separate pieces of information (evidence) provided by more or less reliable or conflicting RSS sources (anchor nodes) on the same hypotheses regarding the target node position. Experiments conducted in two different indoor environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of its accuracy;  robustness;  and computation time and its superiority compared with state-of-the-art methods.
