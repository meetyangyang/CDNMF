Primary care is the backbone of the U.S. healthcare delivery system. In primary care clinics;  teams led by providers play a central role in care delivery. A care service task typically requires joint efforts among the care providers and support staff in the team. Thus;  communications within a team are critical to ensure effective collaboration and coordination between team members to provide high quality of care. Due to such an importance;  team communication and collaboration have received a considerable amount of research attention. However;  most research is qualitative or based on empirical studies. This paper introduces an analytical framework of modeling;  analysis;  and improvement of team communication and collaboration process in primary care clinics. Specifically;  using a queueing network model;  the physicians;  nurses;  and medical assistants are modeled as servers and the communication and collaboration tasks are viewed as customers. The team members interact with each other multiple times to accomplish a task. The efficiency of the team communication and collaboration process is characterized by task throughput;  task completion time;  and the number of iterations to finish a task. Analytical formulas to evaluate such performances are derived and system properties are investigated. In addition;  bottleneck analysis is carried out to identify the constraint that impedes the system performance in the strongest manner. Finally;  a case study at a primary care clinic is presented to illustrate the applicability of the model.
