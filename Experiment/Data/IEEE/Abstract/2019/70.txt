In this paper;  a novel 2-D laser-based autonomous exploration approach for mobile robots is proposed;  which is based on a novel polygon map construction approach and graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with directional endpoint features. This approach is composed of three modules: graph-based SLAM using directional endpoint features;  polygon map construction;  and exploration. Different from existing approaches in the field of 2-D SLAM;  the newly proposed 2-D graph-SLAM is based on 3-D “directional endpoint” features; on this basis;  a well-known data structure “circular-doubly linked list” is applied to construct a novel polygon map for navigation. Note that it is efficient for circular-doubly linked list to initialize and update the polygon map. In addition;  we propose a new information entropy calculation approach to quantify the entropy of the polygon map. Then for each candidate goal;  we could obtain corresponding information gain and make next decision through collision detection. Comparative experimental results with respect to the well-known Gmapping and Karto SLAM are presented to show superior performance of the proposed graph-based SLAM. The autonomous exploration experiments in the office and hallway environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.
