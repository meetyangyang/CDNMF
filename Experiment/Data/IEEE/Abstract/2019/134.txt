The postcapture of a partially failed spacecraft by space manipulators will bring a mutation in the dynamics of the combination. Both the inertia properties and the thruster configuration matrix will change significantly. The unknown dynamics of the partially failed spacecraft also cause a tremendous technical challenge for attitude takeover control. Accordingly;  this paper describes a novel reconfigurable control system for postcapture attitude takeover of a partially failed spacecraft with parametric uncertainties;  whose fuel has been exhausted or whose actuators have partial malfunctions. First;  the reconfigurable control law is designed by command filtering adaptive back-stepping control to guarantee the system performance and global asymptotic stability considering inertia parametric uncertainties. Second;  the thrusters are reconstituted;  without changing the thruster physical configuration. Finally;  the thrusters' forces can be redistributed by the dynamic control reallocation method based on constrained quadratic programing. Numerical simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed approach for postcapture attitude takeover control of a partially failed spacecraft with parametric uncertainties.
