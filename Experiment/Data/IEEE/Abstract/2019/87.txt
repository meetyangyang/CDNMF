In this paper;  we propose a novel path planning framework for autonomous exploration in unknown environments using a mobile robot. A graph structure is incrementally constructed along with the exploration process. The structure is the road map that represents the topology of the explored environment. To construct the road map;  we design a sampling strategy to get random points in the explored environment uniformly. A global path from the current location of the robot to the target area can be found on this road map efficiently. We utilize a lazy collision checking method that only checks the feasibility of the generated global path to improve the planning efficiency. The feasible global path is further optimized with our proposed trajectory optimization method considering the motion constraints of the robot. This mechanism can facilitate the path cost evaluation for the next best view selection. In order to select the next best target region;  we propose a utility function that takes into account both the path cost and the information gain of a candidate target region. Moreover;  we present a target reselection mechanism to evaluate the target region and reduce the extra path cost. The efficiency and effectiveness of our approach are demonstrated using a mobile robot in both simulation and real experimental studies.
