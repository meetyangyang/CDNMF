The state-space models (SSMs) are widely used in a variety of areas where a set of observable variables are used to track some latent variables. While most existing works focus on the statistical modeling of the relationship between the latent variables and observable variables or statistical inferences of the latent variables based on the observable variables;  it comes to our awareness that an important problem has been largely neglected. In many applications;  although the latent variables cannot be routinely acquired;  they can be occasionally acquired to enhance the monitoring of the state-space system. Therefore;  in this paper;  novel dynamic inspection (DI) methods under a general framework of SSMs are developed to identify and inspect the latent variables that are most uncertain. Extensive numeric studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
