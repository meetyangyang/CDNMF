Designing a stabilized distributed model predictive control (DMPC) with constraints is an open and important problem for a class of large-scale distributed systems;  which are composed by both weakly and strongly coupled subsystems. This paper proposes a design of DMPC network to stabilize this class of large-scale systems. A coupling degree-based clustering method is first designed to classify subsystems into some middle-scale subsystems (M-subsystem) off-line according to the adjacent matrix;  so that these M-subsystems are weakly coupled with each other. Then;  each M-subsystem is controlled by a virtual model predictive control (MPC);  which is realized by several individual controllers with running iterative cooperative DMPC algorithm;  since the solution of cooperative DMPC is able to converge to a fixed point without coupling constraints. Each MPC communicates with the corresponding interacted M-subsystems' MPCs once in a control period for exchanging future state evolution estimation. All the subsystem-based MPCs are composed of the proposed peer-to-peer DMPC network. In addition;  an additional consistency and stabilization constraints are added to guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of the overall system. The convergence of the iterative DMPC algorithm for each M-subsystem and the stabilization analysis of the overall system are provided. The simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method.
