The goal of this paper is to localize a resident in indoor environments by using motion information from distributed environmental sensors and body activity information from wearable sensors. The passive infrared sensor nodes distributed in a home provide binary information about human motion in their field of views;  while the wearable inertial measurement unit sensor node collects motion data that can be used in body activity recognition;  walking velocity;  and heading estimation. Basic human activities such as sitting;  sleeping;  standing;  and walking are recognized. We proposed a particle filter-based sensor fusion algorithm that takes advantage of the human location/activity correlation in indoor environments to increase the localization accuracy. Experiments were conducted in a mock apartment testbed. We used the ground truth data obtained from a motion capture system to evaluate the results.
