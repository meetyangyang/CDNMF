Threaded fasteners are prevalent throughout modern manufacturing. Thus;  as the demand for automation in manufacturing increases;  so does the demand for automated threaded fastening systems. However;  many fundamental issues and engineering challenges still hinder robustness in automation;  particularly for smaller screws and critical product finishing requirements. This paper surveys the state of the art in threaded fastening automation and discusses open questions for further research. This survey covers the following areas: 1) fundamentals of threaded fastening;  including basic concepts and definitions; 2) analysis of the entire assembly process (consisting of part feeding and orientation;  pickup;  alignment;  and driving);  including discussions of tools;  control strategies;  and other considerations; 3) failure modes and techniques to mitigate them; 4) threaded fastening systems and electromechanical approaches; and 5) open challenges and suggestions for future development. Understanding the current state of automation in threaded fastening will provide a foundation for researchers to advance this field.
