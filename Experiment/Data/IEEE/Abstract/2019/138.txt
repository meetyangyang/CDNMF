The problem of planning a trajectory for robots starting in an initial state and reaching a final state in a desired interval of time is tackled. We propose an approach based on model predictive control to solve the problem of point-to-point trajectory generation for a given final time. We discuss various choices of models;  objective functions;  and constraints for generating trajectories to transfer the state of the robot;  while respecting physical limitations on the motion as well as fulfilling computational real-time requirements. Extensive simulation results illustrate the use of the approach;  and experiments on an industrial robot in a challenging ball-catching task show the effectiveness of the approach also in demanding scenarios with real-time constraints on the computation. This paper was motivated by the problem of generating movements to transfer a robot from its current state to a new position and velocity at a certain time;  when the target state and the final time may require correction at a high rate. For example;  for picking small objects from a conveyor belt with a variable feed rate;  an off-line planning would fail;  since the motion has to be adjusted as soon as the speed is changed. Under the assumption that the desired pickup position and velocity and arrival time can be predicted;  the approach in this paper is applicable. The movements can be optimized;  for example;  for energy efficiency or for reduction of vibrations in the robot. We discuss how to mathematically express the desired performance criteria and other requirements on the motion;  such as not violating a maximum joint speed. Quick reactions to sensor inputs are computationally demanding. Thus;  we limit ourselves to a class of motion-generation problems that lends itself to numerical optimization. Additionally;  we save computation power by gradually refining the motion.
