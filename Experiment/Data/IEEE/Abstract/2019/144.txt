With the reduction of wafer batch size on account of the diversification and individuation of consumption demands;  increasing importance has been attached to the schedulability and controllability of the cluster tools with multiple wafer types being concurrently processed;  while the corresponding research is seldom and still open. This paper is devoted to addressing the steady-state scheduling of single-arm cluster tools with multiple wafer types and residency time constraints. Inspired by the definition of wafer flow pattern for the single wafer type;  a novel description for the multiple wafer types is introduced. For the sake of efficiency and simplicity;  the multiplex backward sequence is proposed. To balance the workload of process steps;  a virtual module technology with a two-tiered architecture is implemented. Furthermore;  several sufficient and necessary conditions are derived to verify the schedulability of the system. Finally;  an efficient algorithm is presented to find the periodic steady-state schedule;  and its practicability and availability are validated by the given illustrative examples.
