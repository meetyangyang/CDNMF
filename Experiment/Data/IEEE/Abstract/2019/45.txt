This paper extends the scheduling methodology for complex stochastic networks that is based on the solution of a “fluid” relaxation (FR) at each decision point of the original scheduling problem to stochastic networks with blocking and deadlocking effects. For a clearer and more concrete treatment;  the presented results are developed in the operational context of a re-entrant line (RL) with finite buffering capacity at each workstation; these RLs are characterized as “capacitated RLs (CRLs).” From a methodological standpoint;  the paper results are enabled by a pre-established ability to control the underlying resource allocation for deadlock freedom and by the further ability to express the corresponding deadlock avoidance policy as a set of linear inequalities on the system state. Also;  the employed FR for this new regime differs from the FRs that have been employed in past implementations of the method since it must account for the blocking effects that take place in the considered CRLs. The efficacy of the presented scheduling method is assessed through numerical experimentation that compares;  for a set of “benchmark” CRLs;  the performance of the scheduling policies obtained through this method to 1) the performance of the corresponding optimal scheduling policies and also to 2) the performance of some other heuristic scheduling policies for these systems that are adapted from the relevant literature. Finally;  an additional set of experiments demonstrates and assesses the scalability of the presented method by applying it to some pretty large system configurations.
