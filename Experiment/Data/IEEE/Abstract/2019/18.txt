Formation-containment control problems for multiple multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with directed topologies are studied;  where the states of leaders form desired formation and the states of followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. First;  formation-containment protocols are constructed based on the neighboring information of UAVs. Then;  sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems to achieve formation-containment are presented. An explicit expression to describe the relationship among the states of followers;  the time-varying formation for the leaders and the formation reference is derived. It is shown that the states of followers not only converge to the convex hull formed by those of leaders but also keep certain formation specified by the convex combination of the formation for the leaders. Moreover;  an approach to determine the gain matrices of the formation-containment protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally;  a formation-containment platform with five quadrotor UAVs is introduced;  and both the simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.
