This paper considers the scheduling of stochastic customer orders to minimize expected cycle time. Customer orders dynamically arrive at a machine station;  and each order consists of multiple product types. Random workloads are required by each product type;  and the workloads are assigned to a set of unrelated parallel machines in the station to be processed. The objective is to obtain the minimal long-run expected order cycle time through proper workload assignments. In view of the difficulty in evaluating the objective function;  this paper models the targeted problem as a simulation optimization problem and proposes to solve it under the multifidelity model framework. To improve the efficiency in evaluating candidate solutions;  a low-fidelity model is constructed to select solutions with better performances for high-fidelity simulations. The effectiveness of this low-fidelity model is demonstrated through a series of theoretical evidences. A simulation optimization algorithm;  named Bound-Multi-fidelity Optimization with Ordinal Transformation and Optimal Sampling Bound-(MO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\nTOS);  is developed by taking advantage of the properties of the low-fidelity model. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against three other well-known simulation optimization algorithms in the literature. Results indicate that the Bound-MO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\nTOS outperforms all the other tested algorithms;  and its performance is robust against changes in problem scale.
