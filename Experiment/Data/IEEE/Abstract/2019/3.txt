With its aging population;  the United States is under increasing pressure to provide long-term care (LTC) coverage to its citizens and to manage their chronic health conditions. However;  the research on LTC transition and utilization modeling remains in its infancy; needless to mention LTC resource allocation and transition pathway optimization. In this paper;  we developed a parametric survival model to characterize nursing home (NH) length of stay (LOS);  which incorporates information on transition history. In addition;  the model addressed issues such as recurrent events and competing risks. To study the effect of covariates on LOS and to ensure the flexibility of the model in evaluating operational-level interventions;  we elected to develop an accelerated failure time parametric survival model. We fit the model to care transition data collected from a large cohort of older adults receiving coordinated care in a Midwestern United States urban area. Through our study;  we drew the following major conclusions: 1) transition history is a significant factor and a potential predictor of an individual's LOS in NH; 2) significance of frailty terms indicates that LOS estimates based on data with recurrent transition events can be significantly biased if not accounted for explicitly; and 3) the same clinical covariate can have opposite effects on NH LOS;  depending on the destination care setting. Finally;  we identified better-suited baseline hazard functions and frailty terms in each survival model from several representative candidates. Findings from our model can aid in operational-level NH care transition and utilization policy development. This paper also serves as the basis for extension into network-wide LTC transition models and utilization simulators.
