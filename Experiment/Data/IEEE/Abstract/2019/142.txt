Influenced by the economic globalization;  the distributed manufacturing has been a common production mode. This paper considers a multiobjective distributed no-wait flow-shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup time (MDNWFSP-SDST). This scheduling problem exists in many real productions such as baker production;  parallel computer system;  and surgery scheduling. The performance criteria are the makespan and the total weight tardiness. In the MDNWFSP-SDST;  several identical factories are considered with the related flow-shop scheduling problem with no-wait constraints. For solving the MDNWFSP-SDST;  a Pareto-based estimation of distribution algorithm (PEDA) is presented. Three probabilistic models including the probability of jobs in empty factory;  two jobs in the same factory;  and the adjacent jobs are constructed. The PWQ heuristic is extended to the distributed environment to generate initial individuals. A sampling method with the referenced template is presented to generate offspring individuals. Several multiobjective neighborhood search methods are developed to optimize the quality of solutions. The comparison results show that the PEDA obviously outperforms other considered multiobjective optimization algorithms for addressing MDNWFSP-SDST.
