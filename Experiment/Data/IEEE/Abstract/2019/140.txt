3-D printing enables the fabrication of complex architectures at multiple length scales by automating large sequences of additive steps. The increasing sophistication of printers;  materials;  and generative design promise to make geometric complexity a nonissue in manufacturing; however;  this complexity can only be realized if a design can be translated into a physically executable sequence of printing operations. We investigate this planning problem for freeform direct-write assembly;  in which filaments of material are deposited through a nozzle translating along a 3-D path to create sparse;  frame-like structures. We enumerate the process constraints for different variants of the freeform assembly process and show that;  in the case where material stiffens via a glass transition;  determining whether a feasible sequence exists is NP-complete. Nonetheless;  for topologies typically encountered in real-world applications;  finding a feasible or even optimal sequence is a tractable problem. We develop a sequencing algorithm that maximizes the fidelity of the printed part and minimizes the probability of print failure by modeling the assembly as a linear;  elastic frame. We implement the algorithm and validate our approach experimentally;  printing objects composed of thousands of large-aspect-ratio sugar alcohol filaments with diameters of 100-200 Î¼m.
