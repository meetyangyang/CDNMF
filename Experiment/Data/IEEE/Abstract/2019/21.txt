Sweep scan is an emerging five-axis inspection technology of retrieving geometric data from free-form surfaces. Compared with the traditional surface inspection by coordinate measuring machine (CMM) that works in a point-by-point manner;  sweep scan is able to make the stylus tip continuously sweep at high speed on the surface to inspect;  whilst acquiring the 3-D point data accurately and efficiently. However;  at present;  for an arbitrary free-form surface;  it still heavily depends on humans to manually generate a suitable sweep scan path. This paper presents a practical sweep scan path planning method;  which can automatically generate an efficient sweep scan path for an arbitrary free-form surface. The resultant sweep scan path is able to cater to the shape of the surface to inspect and the unique kinematic characteristics of the typical five-axis inspection machine;  so as to achieve a tremendous increase in inspection efficiency. The experiments performed by us show that when compared with some existing automatic sweep scan path generation algorithms such as the simple zigzag method;  the proposed method is able to reduce the total inspection time by as much as seven times.
