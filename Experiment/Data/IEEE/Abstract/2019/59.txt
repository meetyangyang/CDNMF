In the first part of this paper;  a free-form surface matching method called variance-minimization matching (VMM) was proposed to address uneven/open point distributions and measuring noise. The convergence property and sensitivity to measuring defects were theoretically studied. In the second part of this paper;  a series of experiments are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed method in free-form surface matching. The experiments are divided into four sets: a measuring defects experiment;  a noise experiment;  a convergence experiment;  and an artificial experiment. In the first set of experiments;  the existing methods are prone to becoming trapped in a local optimum affected by uneven/open point distributions;  which shows that measured points incline toward dense areas. However;  in VMM;  there is little inclination regardless of the increase in the number of measuring defects. In the second set of experiments;  sensitivity to varying noise is tested. The results show that VMM helps prevent unstable sliding in the presence of Gaussian noise. In the third set of experiments;  we compare convergence speed and convergence stability under different initial positions. It is verified that VMM exhibits the quadratic convergence. Finally;  a set of artificial experiments is implemented;  revealing that the proposed method is appropriate for use in automated manufacturing processes such as geometric inspection and allowance distribution.
