Rigid registration is a fundamental process in many applications that require alignment of different datasets. Iterative closest point (ICP) is a widely used algorithm that iteratively finds point correspondences and updates the rigid transformation. One of the key variants of ICP to its success is the selection of points;  which is directly related to the convergence and robustness of the ICP algorithm. Besides uniform sampling;  there are a number of normal-based and feature-based approaches that consider normal;  curvature;  and/or other signals in the point selection. Among them;  normal-space sampling (NSS) is one of the most popular techniques due to its simplicity and low computational cost. The rationale of NSS is to sample enough constraints to determine all the components of transformation;  but this paper finds that NSS actually can constrain the translational normal space only. This paper extends the fundamental idea of NSS and proposes Dual NSS (DNSS) to sample points in both translational and rotational normal spaces. Compared with NSS;  this approach has similar simplicity and efficiency without any need of additional information;  but has a much better effectiveness. Experimental results show that DNSS can outperform the normal-based and feature-based methods in terms of convergence and robustness. For example;  DNSS can achieve convergence from an orthogonal initial position while no other methods can achieve.
