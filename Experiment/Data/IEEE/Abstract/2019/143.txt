In this paper;  we focus on the formulation of a hybrid methodology that combines analytical models;  constrained optimization schemes;  and machine learning techniques to simplify the execution of dexterous;  in-hand manipulation tasks with adaptive robot hands. More precisely;  the constrained optimization scheme is used to describe the kinematics of adaptive hands during the grasping and manipulation processes;  unsupervised learning (clustering) is used to group together similar manipulation strategies;  dimensionality reduction is used to either extract a set of representative motion primitives (for the identified groups of manipulation strategies) or to solve the manipulation problem in a low-d space and finally an automated experimental setup is used for unsupervised;  automated collection of large data sets. We also assess the capabilities of the derived manipulation models and primitives for both model and everyday life objects;  and we analyze the resulting manipulation ranges of motion (e.g.;  object perturbations achieved during the dexterous;  in-hand manipulation). We show that the proposed methods facilitate the execution of fingertip-based;  within-hand manipulation tasks while requiring minimal sensory information and control effort;  and we demonstrate this experimentally on a range of adaptive hands. Finally;  we introduce DexRep;  an online repository for dexterous manipulation models that facilitate the execution of complex tasks with adaptive robot hands.
