The datagram transport layer security (DTLS) is a de facto standard for the end-to-end security of the constrained application protocol (CoAP) that defines the following three security modes: preshared key (PSK);  raw public key;  and certificate. The pros and cons of each security mode are obvious. Even though the PSK mode is the most preferable in terms of the performance of the DTLS handshake;  the in-advance distribution of a unique symmetric key for each pair of endpoints is difficult as the number of pairs increases. Alternatively;  the certificate mode provides a convenient key-management functionality but its performance is very poor. The focus of most of the previous works is the reduction of the computational load for a single DTLS handshake that is induced by the certificate mode. In this paper;  a group-oriented end-to-end security is considered;  together with the introduction of a new security mode. Namely;  a security association is established between a CoAP client and a group of CoAP servers (sensor devices); however;  a fine-grained access control can be enforced so that each CoAP client can access a limited number of CoAP servers in the group. Furthermore;  when each CoAP client performs several DTLS handshakes with the CoAP servers in the group;  the first DTLS handshake involves a single public-key operation. A public-key operation;  however;  is not required for the subsequent DTLS handshakes;  so the overall computational burden can be reduced. Also;  a testbed was established along with the implementation of the proposed security mechanism for the conduction of a performance comparison with the other security mechanisms.
