This paper is devoted to modeling and analysis of intervention process to reduce hospital readmissions of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As compliance is a major issue among COPD patients;  and economic burden and social support can be important factors affecting compliance and readmission;  we propose to hospital management to reimburse out-of-pocket and transportation costs for COPD patients visiting primary care physicians and rehab centers;  which are used as incentives to encourage them complying with patient-specific intervention plan. Then;  we introduce an optimization model to minimize COPD readmission rate under incentive budget constraint and patients' readmission risks. Solving the problem;  the minimal readmission rates are evaluated and the conditions to achieve the optimal solution are derived;  which can provide a guideline for hospital management to plan appropriate incentive budget and benchmark the desired readmission rate. A case study at a community hospital is presented to illustrate the method. Finally;  cost-effective analysis;  sensitivity studies;  and implementation discussions are carried out.
