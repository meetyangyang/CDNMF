Multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) has been widely used in modern industries and most of traditional MSPM methods are developed using uniformly sampled measurements. However;  process variables are often sampled with different rates in practical industries. On the other hand;  most of the industries are dynamic processes in which the measurements are highly autocorrelated. Thus;  it is difficult to build a dynamic process model with incomplete data sets in multirate processes. In this paper;  a multirate linear Gaussian state-space model is exploited to deal with the above issues. Both the offline model training and online process monitoring schemes are developed in the present of incomplete multirate process data sets. The proposed method is validated through a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process.
