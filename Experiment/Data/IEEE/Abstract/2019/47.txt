Most data-driven process monitoring approaches consider the fault detection as a binary classification issue: normal or abnormal. All deviations from the nominal operating condition can trigger the same alarms. They fail to distinguish different fluctuation patterns and locate the positions of anomalies;  such as the normal deviations in operating conditions;  sensors faults;  actuator faults;  and process faults. A new process monitoring strategy based on orthogonal decomposition (OD) is proposed for the concurrent detection and location of different deviation patterns. OD is performed to discriminate the dynamics of data driven by measured disturbances and unmeasured disturbances in the same control system. This way;  the original variable space is decomposed into the deterministic subspace and stochastic subspace. A dynamic principal component analysis-based subspace identification technique is used to construct the monitoring indices in the deterministic and stochastic subspaces;  respectively. Two case studies show the validity of the OD-based process monitoring approach.
