A deep belief network (DBN) is effective to create a powerful generative model by using training data. However;  it is difficult to fast determine its optimal structure given specific applications. In this paper;  a growing DBN with transfer learning (TL-GDBN) is proposed to automatically decide its structure size;  which can accelerate its learning process and improve model accuracy. First;  a basic DBN structure with single hidden layer is initialized and then pretrained;  and the learned weight parameters are frozen. Second;  TL-GDBN uses TL to transfer the knowledge from the learned weight parameters to newly added neurons and hidden layers;  which can achieve a growing structure until the stopping criterion for pretraining is satisfied. Third;  the weight parameters derived from pretraining of TL-GDBN are further fine-tuned by using layer-by-layer partial least square regression from top to bottom;  which can avoid many problems of traditional backpropagation algorithm-based fine-tuning. Moreover;  the convergence analysis of the TL-GDBN is presented. Finally;  TL-GDBN is tested on two benchmark data sets and a practical wastewater treatment system. The simulation results show that it has better modeling performance;  faster learning speed;  and more robust structure than existing models.
