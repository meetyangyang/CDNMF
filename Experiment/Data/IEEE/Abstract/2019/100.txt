This paper deals with the test of a reconfigurable hardware system (RHS). The latter is a hardware device that allows to change the hardware resources at runtime in order to modify the system functions and therefore to dynamically adapt the system to its environment. The increasing functional complexity of embedded systems and the transition to the RHS make the hardware testing a challenging task;  especially under the confine of providing a high quality with a low cost. Considering the fact that the hardware test represents a key cost factor in a production process;  an optimal test strategy can be advantageous in the competitive industrial market. Accordingly;  this paper introduces a new methodology for an efficient hardware test of RHS. For an RHS;  the number of stuck-at faults can be very large;  which leads to a significant slowdown in the testing process. Because of the redundancy of faults between the different circuits composing an RHS;  the proposed methodology aims at minimizing the number of faults using the inter-circuits relationships and consequently at providing an optimal fault set that can be effectively used for testing. Efficient techniques for test generation and test set validation are proposed to provide the test patterns for faults reduced by inter-circuits fault collapsing. The application of the generated test patterns is typically sufficient to provide an overall fault coverage. The proposed methodology is implemented in a new visual environment named TnTest. An experimental study confirms and validates the expected findings.
