We propose;  in this paper;  an observer-based nonlinear feedback controller for four degrees of freedom (4-DOF) offshore ship-mounted tower cranes;  which includes a robust-type term to address the observation uncertainty;  and a switching logic tuning mechanism to update the involved unknown parameter. As a typical nonlinear underactuated mechatronic system;  unlike the land-fixed tower cranes;  an offshore ship-mounted tower crane also suffers from persistent disturbances caused by sea waves or currents;  which leads to many difficulties and challenges in the controller design of such systems. Existing offshore crane control methods require either linearizations or approximations when performing analysis; moreover;  most of them are only applicable for simplified 2-DOF crane models;  and the ranges of system state errors cannot be guaranteed during the overall process. Motivated by these facts;  to achieve simultaneous accurate jib/trolley positioning and fast payload swings suppression against complex unknown external disturbances;  in particular;  a disturbance observer is first designed in this paper;  based on which a novel nonlinear switching logic-based control scheme for offshore cranes with jib rotation and horizontal transportation is proposed. As far as we know;  the proposed method yields the first observer-based feedback closed-loop control without simplification operations to the original 4-DOF offshore tower crane dynamics and achieves the first asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point for offshore cranes. To support the theoretical derivation;  the corresponding stability analysis of the closed-loop system's equilibrium point is implemented by Lyapunov techniques. Numerous simulation and hardware experimental results are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.
