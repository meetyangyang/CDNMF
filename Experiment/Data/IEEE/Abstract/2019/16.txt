The automated diagnosis helps us better understand the complex landscape of diseases;  leading to more effective;  early and reliable medical diagnosis and therapy. The human-machine interactions in healthcare delivery relying on automated cyber-physical systems (ACPSs) play an important role in the automated diagnosis. Currently;  the multicore accelerator used for ACPS has utilized the network-on-chip (NoC) for personalized healthcare. However;  the discrete cores based on NoC are affected by limited computation speed;  since the data have to pass through an electrical interconnect. In this paper;  we propose a novel optical NoC (ONoC) solution of designing discrete cores to quickly understand biomarkers for early detecting abnormal pathophysiology;  such as the deviation from the protein's native state. We analyze the performance of our ONoC-based ACPS accelerator for personalized healthcare by virtue of the tested proteins widely adopted in the lattice protein model. Our mathematical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the chip area becomes smaller than a traditional design;  which makes the personalized healthcare product more convenient; 2) the computation speed is promoted;  resulting in the rapid understanding of biomarkers; and 3) we improve the data transmission reliability through accurately capturing the photonic effect so that desirable human-machine interactions can be guaranteed.
