Collaborative robots are widely employed in strict hybrid assembly tasks involved in intelligent manufacturing. In this paper;  we develop a teaching-learning-collaboration (TLC) model for the collaborative robot to learn from human demonstrations and assist its human partner in shared working situations. The human could program the robot using natural language instructions according to his/her personal working preferences via this approach. Afterward;  the robot learns from human assembly demonstrations by taking advantage of the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm and updates its task-based knowledge using the optimal assembly strategy. In the collaboration process;  the robot is able to leverage its learned knowledge to actively assist the human in the collaborative assembly task. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach presents considerable robustness and applicability in human-robot collaborative tasks.
