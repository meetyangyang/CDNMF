This paper presents a joint trajectory smoothing and tracking framework for a specific class of targets with smooth motion. We model the target trajectory by a continuous function of time (FoT);  which leads to a curve fitting approach that finds a trajectory FoT fitting the sensor data in a sliding time-window. A simulation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tracking a maneuvering target;  in comparison with the conventional filters and smoothers.
