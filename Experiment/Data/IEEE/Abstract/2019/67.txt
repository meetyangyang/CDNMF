This paper constructs an integrated virtual reconfiguration model that can simultaneously group workstations;  schedule virtual cells;  and select energy consumption levels. If managers prefer the physical proximity of machines in a certain virtual cell;  the material handling cost in it can be reduced. However;  the distances among machines in other virtual cells are probably large;  which may cause greater material handling cost. If a virtual cell for a certain product type has priority to be created;  the backorder cost of that type can be decreased or even avoided. Nevertheless;  the creation of virtual cells for other product types may be delayed;  perhaps leading to the higher backorder cost of other product types. In addition;  managers can choose a high energy consumption level of a machine to expedite its production to reduce backorder cost at the expense of more energy consumption cost. To minimize the total operational cost;  we develop a novel Discrete Imperialist Competitive Algorithm with a Priority rule-based heuristic (DICAP). It includes a colony movement strategy;  a competition strategy;  a collapse mechanism;  a development strategy;  and a sufficient convergence policy. Numerical experiments and t-test are conducted to validate that the proposed DICAP outperforms genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.
