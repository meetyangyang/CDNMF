Focusing on generalized sensor combinations;  this paper deals with the attitude estimation problem using a linear complementary filter (CF). The quaternion observation model is obtained via a gradient descent algorithm. An additive measurement model is then established according to derived results. The filter is named as the generalized CF where the observation model is simplified as a linear one that is quite different from previous-reported brute-force nonlinear results. Moreover;  we prove that representative derivative-based optimization algorithms are essentially equivalent to each other. Derivations are given to establish the state model based on the quaternion kinematic equation. The proposed algorithm is validated under several experimental conditions involving the free-living environment;  harsh external field disturbances;  and aerial flight test aided by robotic vision. Using the specially designed experimental devices;  data acquisition and algorithm computations are performed to give comparisons on accuracy;  robustness;  time-consumption;  and so on with representative methods. The results show that not only the proposed filter can give fast;  accurate;  and stable estimates in terms of various sensor combinations but also produces robust attitude estimation in the scenario of harsh situations;  e.g.;  irregular magnetic distortion.
