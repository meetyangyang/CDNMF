This paper introduces a system-theoretic approach to improve inpatient discharge process at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital. The complex hospital discharge process is modeled by a stochastic process with parallel subprocesses;  splits;  merges;  and reworks. Then;  a stochastic analysis method is introduced to evaluate the performance of discharge. Specifically;  the waiting and service times are characterized by gamma distributions;  and an efficient algorithm is presented to aggregate the multiple interacting subprocesses and calculate the mean;  variability;  and discharge-time performance;  i.e.;  the probability to discharge a patient within a desired or given time interval. High accuracy in performance evaluation is obtained by using such a method. To improve the discharge process at UW Hospital;  bottleneck and what-if analyses are carried out and improvement recommendations are discussed.
