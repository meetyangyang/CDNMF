As collaborative robots begin to appear on factory floors;  there is a need to consider how these robots can best help their human partners. In this paper;  we propose an optimization framework that generates task assignments and schedules for a human-robot team with the goal of improving both time and ergonomics and demonstrate its use in six real-world manufacturing processes that are currently performed manually. Using the strain index method to quantify human physical stress;  we create a set of solutions with assigned priorities on each goal. The resulting schedules provide engineers with insight into selecting the appropriate level of compromise and integrating the robot in a way that best fits the needs of an individual process.
