This paper aims to devise efficient combination chemotherapy schedules that determine the dosages of drugs administered to cancer patients with drug resistance that;  as a Gordian knot to cancer chemotherapy;  may weaken the efficacy of chemotherapy. To characterize cell growth;  we use the existing cell cycle-specific model;  in which the mechanism of acquired drug resistance is incorporated. Subsequently;  the determination of the optimal chemotherapy schedule for the patients is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem;  with the objective of minimizing not only the quantity of tumor cells but also the posttreatment chemotherapy-induced toxicity. To overcome the difficulty in finding a satisfactory solution to the problem due to its nonlinear nature;  we develop a memetic algorithm (MA) with an advanced local search strategy. The efficiency of the proposed MA is validated by comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. In addition;  we compare the best found solution to the problem in the presence of drug resistance with that in the absence of drug resistance. The resultant findings reveal that drug resistance is a crucial factor in the determination of chemotherapy schedules.
