Chatter is a typical kind of unstable dynamics often encountered in machining processes;  which often results in overcut and rapid tool wear. Hence;  chatter phenomenon worsens the surface quality and reduces productivity in milling systems as well. Recent years have witnessed a surging industrial demand of high quality and high efficiency machining. Specifically;  for low radial immersion milling situation;  large depth of cuts is inevitably needed so as to increase the machining efficiency. To fulfill such a task;  this paper develops a robust active control method to mitigate the chatter dynamics of low radial immersion milling processes. The present approach increases the axial depth of cuts;  and the improvement is inversely proportional to the radial immersion ratio. Finally;  case studies are conducted to show the substantially enlarged stable region in the stability lobe diagram (SLD) spanned by spindle rotational speed and axial depth of cut. Thus;  the method can be expected to improve the efficiency of milling processes.
