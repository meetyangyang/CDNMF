In this paper;  a multilevel humanlike motion planning approach is proposed for indoor mobile robots. Compared with existing approaches;  the novelty of this paper is twofold: 1) the proposed path planning framework is multilevel and humanlike to ensure both foreseeability and flexibility;  wherein functions of human brain;  eyes;  and legs are corresponding to global path planning;  sensor-level path planning;  and action-level path planning;  respectively;  and 2) along the planned path;  a new velocity-adjustable trajectory planning algorithm is put forward which is provably complete and time optimal considering multiple constraints from both the robot and the environment. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a better performance in terms of efficiency;  smoothness;  foreseeability;  and flexibility;  and autonomous navigation is realized in large-scale;  dynamic;  partially unknown;  and unstructured indoor environments.
