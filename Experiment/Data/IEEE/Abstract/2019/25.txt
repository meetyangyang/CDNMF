Many operation optimization problems such as scheduling and assignment of interest to the automation community are mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. Because of their combinatorial nature;  the effort required to obtain optimal solutions increases drastically as the problem size increases. Such operation optimization problems typically need to be solved several times a day and require short solving times (e.g.;  5;  10;  or 20 min). The goal is;  therefore;  to obtain near-optimal solutions with quantifiable quality in a computationally efficient manner. Existing MILP methods;  however;  suffer from slow convergence and may not efficiently achieve this goal. In this paper;  motivated by fast convergence of augmented Lagrangian relaxation (LR);  a novel advanced price-based decomposition and coordination “surrogate absolute-value LR” (SAVLR) approach is developed. Within the method;  convergence of our recent surrogate LR (SLR);  which has overcome all major difficulties of traditional LR;  is significantly improved by penalizing constraint violations by adding “absolute-value” penalties. Moreover;  such penalties are efficiently linearized in a standard way;  thereby enabling the use of MILP solvers. By exploiting the beautiful property of exponential reduction of complexity of subproblems upon decomposition;  subproblems are efficiently solved and their solutions are efficiently coordinated by updating Lagrangian multipliers. Convergence is then proved under novel adjustment of penalty coefficients. A series of generalized assignment problems is considered;  and for these problems;  superior performance of SAVLR over other state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice methods is demonstrated. Accompanying CPLEX codes;  whereby SAVLR is implemented;  are also included.
