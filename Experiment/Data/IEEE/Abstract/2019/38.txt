This paper proposes an efficient strategy for the insertion of the partially flexible object in precision assembly. The partially flexible object refers to the component with unevenly distributed flexibilities: coupling rigidity and flexibility. This paper focuses on the insertion of one class of partially flexible objects: rigid shapes connected by a compliant mechanism. We first analyze the horizontal compliance of the compliant mechanism and build a model to relate its state and force. The insertion is separated into two stages according to the insertion type. The first stage is a compliant insertion and we estimate the insertion direction based on the built model;  horizontally compensate resorting to the horizontal compliance and the updated direction;  and efficiently plan the vertical insertion in an aggressive strategy regarding the uncertainties caused by the compliant mechanism and predicting the future insertion. The second stage is a hybrid insertion with both rigid and compliant gripping and its features include that the object states are not precisely measurable and the motion of a part of the object is not directly controllable. To solve it;  we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze all possible configurations and;  taking advantage of the insertion property;  conclude one insertion posture based on which a control strategy is proposed. Additionally;  a conservative insertion strategy is planned resorting to the past execution performance and the current state evaluation. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the validation of the proposed method.
