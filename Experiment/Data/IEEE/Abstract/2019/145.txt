A tower crane is a nonlinear mechatronic system with complicated underactuated characteristics;  which is widely used in modern construction sites. At present;  most existing methods for tower cranes are proposed by linearizing the original nonlinear dynamics near equilibrium points;  which are;  thus;  prone to suffering from unexpected steady errors due to such factors as unmodeled dynamics;  imperfect friction compensation;  etc.;  since they have not included integral terms in either controller design or stability analysis. Therefore;  in this paper;  an improved feedback controller with an elaborately constructed integral term is proposed for 3-D tower cranes without linearization;  which can achieve both antiswing and positioning control while being able to effectively reduce steady errors in the presence of;  e.g.;  inaccurate friction compensation. Furthermore;  asymptotic stability results are proven through rigorous theoretical analysis. Owing to no linearization;  the proposed controller is applicable when state variables (e.g.;  cargo swing angles) are not close enough to the equilibrium points;  which makes it suitable for complicated working conditions. Hardware experimental results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
