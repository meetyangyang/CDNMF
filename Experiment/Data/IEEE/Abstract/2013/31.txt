Conventionally;  improving production efficiency;  flexibility and responsiveness has been the primary research focus of production management;  while energy consumption has received relatively little attention. Energy consumption plays a more and more important role in the manufacturing environment. This is mainly driven by energy cost and environmental concerns. When the energy system becomes complicated and coupled with ongoing production;  it is very difficult to hunt the “hidden treasure” which affects the overall benefit of a manufacturing system. This paper provides a systematic method to search for energy saving opportunities and strategies. We start from dynamic production transient analysis and provide quantitative analysis for identifying energy saving opportunity in a system. Furthermore;  energy saving strategy is justified through cost analysis for tradeoffs between energy savings and throughput loss. A case study is conducted to demonstrate its potential on energy savings in a multistage manufacturing system.
