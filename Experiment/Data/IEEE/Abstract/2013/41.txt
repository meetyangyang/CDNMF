Flooding of alarms is a very crucial problem in process industries. An alarm flood makes an operator ineffective of taking necessary actions;  and often risking an emergency shutdown or a major upset. In this work;  the flooding of alarms is discussed based on the standards presented in ISA 18.2. A new analysis method is proposed to investigate similar alarm floods from the historic alarm data and group them on the basis of the patterns of alarm occurrences. A case study on real industrial alarm data is also presented to demonstrate the utility of the proposed analysis.
