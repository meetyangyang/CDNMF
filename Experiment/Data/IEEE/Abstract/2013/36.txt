This paper addresses the problem of online fault detection and diagnosis in discrete event systems modeled by labeled Petri nets and using Integer Linear Programming Problem (ILPP) solutions. In particular;  unobservable (silent) transitions model faults and both observable and unobservable transitions model the nominal system behavior. Furthermore;  observable transitions exhibit a kind of non determinism since several different transitions may share the same event label. This paper proposes two diagnosers that work in two different system settings. The first one is a centralized fault detection strategy: the diagnoser waits for an observable event and an algorithm defines and solves some ILPPs to decide whether the system behavior is normal or may exhibit some faults. In the second setting;  the system consists of a set of interacting PN modules and each module is monitored by a diagnoser that has local information on the module structure. Moreover;  each diagnoser observes and detects the faults of the module it is attached to and shares information in some of its places that are shared with other modules of the system. Some case studies show the two different approaches and point out the peculiarities of the proposed strategies.
