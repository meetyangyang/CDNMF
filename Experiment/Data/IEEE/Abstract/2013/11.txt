This paper explores energy efficient building design for manufacturing plants. Many efforts have been directed into the field of building design optimization concerning building energy performance;  but most of the studies focus on residential buildings or public buildings. Very limited research results studying plants buildings have been reported. However;  plants buildings have certain unique features that make the design problem more challenging. Furthermore;  the approaches presented in the current publications could not guarantee the performance of their designs if the computation capacity is limited. This paper attempts to address these two issues. First;  an EnergyPlus-integrated overall energy consumption estimation framework is developed for a class of manufacturing plants;  where the environmental conditions would not affect the energy consumption of the production processes. Based on that;  the building design problem for this type of manufacturing plants is formulated as a stochastic programming problem concerning uncertainties arising from the future weather conditions and energy prices;  where seasonal production scheduling optimizing is incorporated when estimating the performance of building designs. Second;  Ordinal Optimization (OO) method is introduced to solve the problem so as to quantitatively guarantee a high probability of finding satisfactory designs while reducing the computation burden. A numerical example is provided;  showing our solution method performs effectively in finding a satisfactory design.
