A multiobjective optimization model is presented in this paper for the Autonomous Straddle Carriers Scheduling (ASCS) problem in automated container terminals;  which is more practical than the single objective model. The model considers three objectives [i.e.;  Straddle Carriers (SCs) traveling time;  SC waiting time and finishing time of high-priority container-transferring jobs];  and their weighted sum is investigated as the representative example. The presented model is formulated as a pickup and delivery problem with time windows in the form of binary integer programming. An exact algorithm based on Branch-and-Bound with Column Generation (BBCG) is employed for solving the multiobjective ASCS problem. Based on the map of an actual fully automated container terminal;  simulation results are compared with the single-objective scheduling to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the presented multiobjective model;  as well as the efficacy of the BBCG algorithm for autonomous SC scheduling.
