Buildings account for nearly 40% of global energy consumption. About 40% and 15% of that are consumed;  respectively;  by HVAC and lighting. These energy uses can be reduced by integrated control of active and passive sources of heating;  cooling;  lighting;  shading and ventilation. However;  rigorous studies of such control strategies are lacking since computationally tractable models are not available. In this paper;  a novel formulation capturing key interactions of the above building functions is established to minimize the total daily energy cost. To obtain effective integrated strategies in a timely manner;  a methodology that combines stochastic dynamic programming (DP) and the rollout technique is developed within the price-based coordination framework. For easy implementation;  DP-derived heuristic rules are developed to coordinate shading blinds and natural ventilation;  with simplified optimization strategies for HVAC and lighting systems. Numerical simulation results show that these strategies are scalable;  and can effectively reduce energy costs and improve human comfort.
