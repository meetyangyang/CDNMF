For flexible manufacturing systems;  there are normally some durations in which a number of machines are idle and do not process any parts. Devising a control policy to turn off the idle machines and reduce their level of energy consumption is a significant contribution towards the green manufacturing paradigm. This paper addresses the design of such a control strategy for a closed-loop flow shop plant based on a one-loop pallet system. The main goal is to coordinate running of the machines and motion of pallets to gain the minimal energy consumption in idle machines;  as well as to obtain the desired throughput for the plant. To fulfill this goal;  first mathematical conditions;  which economically characterize the on-off control for machines;  are presented. Constrained to these conditions and the mathematical models describing the pallet system;  a mixed integer nonlinear minimization problem with the energy monitor as the objective function is then developed. Provided that the problem computation time can be managed;  the optimal control for the operation of the plant and the minimal energy consumption in the idle machines are computed. To deal with the time complexity;  a linearized form of the model and a heuristic approach are introduced. These methods are applied to some examples of industrial size;  and their impacts in practice are discussed and verified by using a discrete event simulation tool.
