This paper presents an automatic manipulation system consisting of microscope and pneumatic actuator. Through image captured by microscope with a CCD camera;  the position between the probe and the object can be calculated in the image plane. A visual fuzzy controller is designed to improve the precision of a nonlinear pneumatic manipulator. From the experimental results;  the position error of the system is below 1 pixel. The system can be applied to puncture fish embryo.
