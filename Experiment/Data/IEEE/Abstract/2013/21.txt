This paper presents a requirement-based bidding language for agent-based scheduling. The language allows agents to attach their valuations directly to scheduling performance requirements. Compared with general bidding languages;  the proposed one reduces agents' valuation and system's communication complexities. In addition;  it results in efficient winner determination problem models. Experimental results show that the requirement-based language exhibits superior winner determination performance in terms of problem-solving speed and scalability.
