Automatic assessment of nanostructure quality is essential for scale-up nanomanufacturing. In our previous work;  we have developed a method to quantify nanostructure growth quality and detect structural defects through interaction analysis. However;  because the method builds on complete feature measurement;  its direct application to nanomanufacturing systems is severely constrained by nanostructure metrology. For current inspection techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM);  the major difficulties of measuring nanostructures lie in two aspects: (i) taking and calibrating images for seamless coverage and (ii) extracting and matching feature information from the images. In this paper;  we develop a tailored sampling strategy to relax the metrology constraint. It not only explores the growth region with greatly reduced metrology efforts but maintains desired sampling resolution. In addition;  we customize Expectation-Maximization algorithm to optimize interaction estimation with corresponding “incomplete” measurement. Our developed approach enables nanostructure characterization within manufacturing relevant time spans and thus provides a supporting tool for nanomanufacturing.
