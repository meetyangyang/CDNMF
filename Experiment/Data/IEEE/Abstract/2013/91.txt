This paper considers minimizing makespan for a blocking flowshop scheduling problem;  which has important application in a variety of modern industries. A constructive heuristic is first presented to generate a good initial solution by combining the existing profile fitting (PF) approach and Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) heuristic in an effective way. Then;  a memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed including effective techniques like a heuristic-based initialization;  a path-relinking-based crossover operator;  a referenced local search;  and a procedure to control the diversity of the population. Afterwards;  the parameters and operators of the proposed MA are calibrated by means of a design of experiments approach. Finally;  a comparative evaluation is carried out with the best performing algorithms presented for the blocking flowshop with makespan criterion;  and with the adaptations of other state-of-the-art MAs originally designed for the regular flowshop problem. The results show that the proposed MA performs much better than the other algorithms. Ultimately;  75 out of 120 upper bounds provided by Ribas [“An iterated greedy algorithm for the flowshop scheduling with blocking”;  OMEGA;  vol. 39;  pp. 293-301;  2011.] for Taillard flowshop benchmarks that are considered as blocking flowshop instances are further improved by the presented MA.
