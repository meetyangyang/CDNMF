Ray shooting is a well-studied problem in computer graphics and also has applications in robotics such as collision detection and contact force optimization. Unfortunately;  most ray-shooting algorithms developed for graphics applications only allow 3-dimensional (3-D) objects represented as triangle meshes;  and therefore are not suited for objects with parametric surfaces or general convex sets in high-dimensional space which robotics applications often require. In contact force optimization;  for example;  the problem is in the 6-dimensional (6-D) wrench space and it is desirable to consider the nonlinear friction cone without approximating it by a pyramid. This paper discusses existing and novel geometry-based ray-shooting algorithms applicable to general convex sets;  and compares their performances in two robotics applications: computing the distance between two convex objects and optimizing contact forces in grasping.
