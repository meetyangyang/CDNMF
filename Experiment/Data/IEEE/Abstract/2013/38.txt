This paper presents the Latent Nestling Method (LNM) formalization in hybrid systems. For the proposed LNM;  it is necessary to include places of continuous or differential character;  allowing the analysis of continuous dynamical variable. This paper is a continuation of our previous papers \n<citerefgrp xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <citeref refid=\ref7\/></citerefgrp>\n;  \n<citerefgrp xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><citeref refid=\ref23\/> </citerefgrp>\n. Here;  the LNM is exploited to analyze the extension to hybrid systems. One of the contributions of this work is a practical application of the LNM in hybrid systems. The case study is the Lubrication and Cooling system of a Wind Turbine Gearbox. The model of the system is built using colored Petri nets formalism and the classic techniques of continuous and hybrid Petri nets. Simulation results are presented to validate some key concepts of the formalization in hybrid systems.
