Two types of diagnosability of stochastic discrete-event systems (DESs) were introduced by Thorsley in 2005;  where a necessary and sufficient condition for Strong Stochastic (SS)-Diagnosability (referred as A-diagnosability by Thorsley and Teneketzis;  2005);  and a sufficient condition for Stochastic (S)-Diagnosability (referred as AA-diagnosability by Thorsley and Teneketzis;  2005);  both with exponential complexity;  were reported. In this paper;  we present polynomial complexity tests for checking: (i) necessity and sufficiency of SS-Diagnosability; (ii) sufficiency of S-Diagnosability; and (iii) sufficiency as well as necessity of S-Diagnosability; the latter requires an additional notion of probabilistic equivalence. Thus;  the work presented improves the accuracy as well as the complexity of verifying stochastic diagnosability.
