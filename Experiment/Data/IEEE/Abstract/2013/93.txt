Sensors and actuators are two indispensable parts in the paradigm of feedback control. Their implementation cost should be properly evaluated and constrained. In the previous work;  a Petri net monitor with the least cost is synthesized through integer programming formulation. Despite its technical correctness;  the existing method may lead to undesirable results when the net structure contains some shared or unshared resource places of a manufacturing-oriented net model. A necessary and sufficient condition is established to show that certain structures can lead to deadlock-prone supervisors. An efficient algorithm is developed to identify such structures. Furthermore;  it is shown that if one can identify such structures at the initial stage;  it is possible to achieve desirable controllers for the original systems. The theoretical correctness of the proposed algorithm is discussed. A manufacturing example is provided to illustrate the proposed approach.
