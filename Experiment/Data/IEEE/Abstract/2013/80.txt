Disassembly planning is aimed to perform the optimal disassembly sequence given a used or obsolete product in terms of cost and environmental impact. However;  the actual disassembly process of products can experience great uncertainty due to a variety of unpredictable factors. To deal with such uncertainty;  this work presents some chance constrained programming models for disassembly cost from the perspective of stochastic planning. Moreover;  two hybrid intelligent algorithms;  namely;  one integrating stochastic simulation and neural network (NN);  and another integrating stochastic simulation;  genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network (NN);  are proposed to solve the proposed models;  respectively. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models and the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.
