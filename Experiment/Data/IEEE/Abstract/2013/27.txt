One of the major limitations for Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)-based nanomanipulation is that AFM only has one sharp tip as the end-effector;  and can only apply a point force to the nanoobject;  which makes it extremely difficult to achieve a stable manipulation. For example;  the AFM tip tends to slip-away during nanoparticle manipulation due to its small touch area;  and there is no available strategy to manipulate a nanorod in a constant posture with a single tip since the applied point force can make the nanorod rotate more easily. In this paper;  a robotic nano-hand method is proposed to solve these problems. The basic idea is using a single tip to mimic the manipulation effect that multi-AFM tip can achieve through the planned high speed sequential tip pushing. The theoretical behavior models of nanoparticle and nanorod are developed;  based on which the moving speed and trajectory of the AFM tip are planned artfully to form a nano-hand. In this way;  the slip-away problem during nanoparticle manipulation can be get rid of efficiently;  and a posture constant manipulation for nanorod can be achieved. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.
