We present a free space computation algorithm for two planar bodies bounded by line segments and circular arcs. The computational complexity is O(((mn)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n+k)log(mn)) with m and n the number of boundary curves of the two bodies;  and with k the number of configurations with three pairs of curves in contact. Although k is in O((mn)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\n);  mild input restrictions reduce it to O(mn). We develop a robust implementation that is accurate;  is fast;  and handles degenerate input.
