Assembly partitioning with an infinite translation is the application of an infinite translation to partition an assembled product into two complementing subsets of parts;  referred to as subassemblies;  each treated as a rigid body. We present an exact implementation of an efficient algorithm to obtain such a motion and subassemblies given an assembly of polyhedra in R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\n. We do not assume general position. Namely;  we handle degenerate input;  and produce exact results. As often occurs;  motions that partition a given assembly or subassembly might be isolated in the infinite space of motions. Any perturbation of the input or of intermediate results;  caused by;  for example;  imprecision;  might result with dismissal of valid partitioning-motions. In the extreme case;  where there is only a finite number of valid partitioning-motions;  no motion may be found;  even though such exists. The implementation is based on software components that have been developed and introduced only recently. They paved the way to a complete;  efficient;  and concise implementation.
