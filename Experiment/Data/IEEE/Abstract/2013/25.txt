This paper presents experimental analysis of laser interferometry-based closed-loop robust motion tracking control for flexure-based four-bar micro/nano manipulator. To enhance the accuracy of micro/nano manipulation;  laser interferometry realized robust motion tracking control is established with the experimental facility. This paper contains brief discussions about the error sources associated with the laser interferometry-based sensing and measurement technique;  along with detailed error analysis and estimation. Comparative error analysis of capacitive position sensor-based system and laser interferometry-based system is also presented. Robust control demonstrates high precision and accurate motion tracking of the four-bar flexure-based mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate precise motion tracking;  where resultant closed-loop position tracking error is of the order of ± 20 nm;  and a steady-state error of about ±10 nm. With the experimental study and error analysis;  we offer evidence that the laser interferometry-based closed-loop robust motion tracking control can minimize positioning and tracking errors during dynamic motion.
