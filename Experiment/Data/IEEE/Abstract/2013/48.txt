This paper proposes a methodology for analysis of kinematic errors in robotic manipulators. The approach is based on interval analysis and predicts end-effector pose deviation from its ideal model using the interval bounds on the errors of the individual axes. In contrast to sampling-based Monte Carlo methods;  the proposed methodology offers guaranteed bounds for the error that accumulates at the end-effector. The forward kinematics map is extended to intervals using the product of exponentials formulation with interval joint parameters. This is a convenient method that incorporates both analytical and computational techniques and can be used for error analysis;  or inversely;  for manipulator design. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the calculated interval bounds fully enclose the end-effector error distribution and provide a measure of its volumetric size. An important application of this method is in the design of modular precision manipulators that can be assembled using individual linear and rotary stages.
