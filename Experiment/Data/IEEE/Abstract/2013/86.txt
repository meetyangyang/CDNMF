Although a cellular manufacturing system can produce diversified products flexibly;  its assembly efficiency is mainly limited by the operators' assembly performance. To improve the operators' assembly performance without longtime training;  an assembly-skill-transferring method was proposed to realize the assembly skill transfer process from skilled operators to novice operators. In the cellular manufacturing system;  the assembly skills consist of cognition skills and motor skills. Taking a “Peg-in-Hole Task” as an example;  the effect of the proposed assembly transfer method was verified for motor skills. The results show that the proposed assembly-skill-transferring system can improve the novice operators' assembly performance greatly.
