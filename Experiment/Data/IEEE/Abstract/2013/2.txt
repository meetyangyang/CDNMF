Driven by wind and solar photovoltaics technology;  the power industry is shifting towards a distributed generation (DG) paradigm. A key challenge in deploying a renewable DG system is the power volatility. This study proposes a visionary energy concept and further presents a mathematical model that could help the large industry consumers adopt this new energy technology. The study seeks to design a grid-connected DG system that is capable of providing the necessary electricity for wafer fabs. Simulation-based optimization algorithm was applied to determine the equipment type and capacity aiming to minimize the DG lifecycle cost. The proposed method was demonstrated on fab facilitates located in three different regions in the US.
