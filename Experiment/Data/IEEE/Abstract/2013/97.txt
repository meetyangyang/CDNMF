In dense radio frequency identification (RFID) systems;  reader-to-reader interference may appear among readers operating nearby. When the anticollision algorithm is Frame Slotted Aloha (FSA);  a usual solution is to multiplex the frames of interfering readers by means of a central controller. The scenario studied considers RFID tags attached to objects carried by conveyor belts or vehicles so that each tag crosses;  in constant motion;  one reader's interrogation region. The problem addressed consists of determining the length of the multiplexed FSA frames such that each object is successfully identified;  with high probability;  before exiting its interrogation region. In this paper;  we develop a mathematical model;  based on dynamic system theory;  allowing us to obtain the configurations attaining the desired reliability objective;  to show that some configurations present multiple equilibrium points and should be avoided;  and to define the operating boundaries of the system. The model can also incorporate fading and capture effects.
