Due to the complexity of modern manufacturing systems and the lack of optimal management of energy consumption;  the energy efficiency of manufacturing systems in real industrial environment is much lower than designed level;  which significantly increases operation cost;  impedes company competitiveness in the global market;  leads to high carbon dioxide emission;  and results in destroyed environment and ecology. Compared with existing research efforts on energy management of single machine system in the literature;  few works have been performed to study the opportunity for energy management of typical manufacturing systems with multiple machines and buffers. From the point-of-view of sustainability;  considering stochastic factor and buffer utilization;  this paper investigates the opportunity estimation for real-time energy control of typical multi-machine manufacturing systems without sacrificing system throughput. A numerical case study based on an automotive assembly line is used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
