In this paper;  we demonstrate an underactuated finger design and grasping method for precision grasping and manipulation of small objects. Taking inspiration from the human grasping strategy for picking up objects from a flat surface;  we introduce the flip-and-pinch task;  in which the hand picks up a thin object by flipping it into a stable configuration between two fingers. Despite the fact that finger motions are not fully constrained by the hand actuators;  we demonstrate that the hand and fingers can interact with the table surface to produce a set of constraints that result in a repeatable quasi-static motion trajectory. Even when utilizing only open-loop kinematic playback;  this approach is shown to be robust to variation in object size and hand position. Variation of up to 20Â° in orientation and 10 mm in hand height still result in experimental success rates of 80% or higher. These results suggest that the advantages of underactuated;  adaptive robot hands can be carried over from basic grasping tasks to more dexterous tasks.
