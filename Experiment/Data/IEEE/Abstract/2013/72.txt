A proper control of a system to get a desired function and increase the system lifetime is a crucial step towards the sustainable paradigm. In this paper;  such a control is designed for a cyclic pallet system to achieve a minimal force on its drive unit;  meet safety conditions on the system chain tension force;  and the momentum of pallets;  and fulfill a desired production rate. The optimal values of control parameters;  namely;  number of pallets;  conveyor velocity;  and part set schedule;  are obtained through solving a mixed integer linear optimization model. The objective function in the model defines the average force on the drive unit in a cycle production. In addition;  the related constraints characterize the pallet system properties such as cyclic and dynamic behavior;  buffer size;  constant work in process;  and safety specifications. This optimization model strongly suffers from the time complexity due to the binary decision variables defining the part set schedule. To reasonably handle the computation time;  a heuristic search strategy based on a modified form of the weighted profile fitting algorithm is introduced. Furthermore;  the robustness of the optimal control and the system design is analyzed;  using worst control and worst but safe control strategies. The optimal control and the robustness analysis are applied to some case studies;  and the results are evaluated and discussed.
