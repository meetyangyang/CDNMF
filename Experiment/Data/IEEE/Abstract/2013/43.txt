Contact mode Atomic Force Microscopy (CM-AFM) is popularly used by the biophysics community to study mechanical properties of cells cultured in petri dishes;  or tissue sections fixed on microscope slides. While cells are fairly easy to locate;  sampling in spatially heterogeneous tissue specimens is laborious and time-consuming at higher magnifications. Furthermore;  tissue registration across multiple magnifications for AFM-based experiments is a challenging problem;  suggesting the need to automate the process of AFM indentation on tissue. In this work;  we have developed an image-guided micropositioning system to align the AFM probe and human breast-tissue cores in an automated manner across multiple magnifications. Our setup improves efficiency of the AFM indentation experiments considerably.
