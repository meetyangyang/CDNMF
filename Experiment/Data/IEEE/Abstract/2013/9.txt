Remanufacturing is a practice of growing importance due to increasing environmental awareness and regulations. However;  little research focuses on stochastic remanufacturing process routings (RPR). This paper presents an analytical method;  where four Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT)-based RPR models are proposed to mathematically represent and analyze the variability of remanufacturing task sequences. In particular;  with the method;  the probability of individual processes being taken in a remanufacturing system and the time associated with them can be efficiently determined. The proposed method is demonstrated through the remanufacturing of used lathe spindles and telephones;  and verified by Arena simulation. Numerical experiments that investigate the relationships between RPR dynamics and other system parameters (such as inventory control for due-time performance and time buffer size for bottleneck control) are included.
