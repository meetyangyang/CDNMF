The reduction of energy consumption is today addressed with great effort in manufacturing industry. In this paper;  we improve upon a previously presented method for robotic system scheduling. By applying dynamic programming to existing trajectories;  we generate new energy optimal trajectories that follow the same path but in a different execution time frame. With this new method;  it is possible to solve the optimization problem for a range of execution times for the individual operations;  based on one simulation only. The minimum energy trajectories can then be used to derive a globally energy optimal schedule. A case study of a cell comprised of four six-link manipulators is presented;  in which energy optimal dynamic time scaling is compared to linear time scaling. The results show that a significant decrease in energy consumption can be achieved for any given cycle time.
