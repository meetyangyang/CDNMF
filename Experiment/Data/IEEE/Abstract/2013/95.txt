The use of passive ultra high-frequency (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) integrated into plywood boards is proposed to enable the identification and tracking of individual plywood boards and end products of plywood. For the first time;  tags are embeddable inside plywood by direct inkjet-printing tag antennas on pure birch veneer. The use of passive UHF RFID technology in the applications of plywood industry is discussed;  two tag antenna designs for plywood are presented and the tag fabrication procedures are described. Furthermore;  results from tag performance measurements performed in the authentic application environment as well as in anechoic conditions are presented and discussed. Measurements show that tags printed on veneer and embedded inside 2 mm thick plywood board exhibited theoretical read ranges from 7.9 to 10.1 meters. The read ranges obtained meet the demands of the plywood industry and offer reliable identification even in challenging environments.
