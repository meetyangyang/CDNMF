Pick-place of single nanowires inside scanning electron microscopes (SEM) is useful for prototyping functional devices and characterizing nanowires's properties. Nanowire pick-place has been typically performed via teleoperation;  which is time-consuming and highly skill-dependent. This paper presents an automated approach to the pick-place of single nanowires. Through SEM visual detection and vision-based motion control;  the system automatically transferred individual silicon nanowires from their growth substrate to a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device that characterized the nanowires's electromechanical properties. The performance of the nanorobotic pick-up and placement procedures was experimentally quantified.
