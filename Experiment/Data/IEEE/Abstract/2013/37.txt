A set of metrics is proposed that evaluates speed and separation monitoring efficacy in industrial robot environments in terms of the quantification of safety and the effects on productivity. The collision potential is represented by separation metrics and sensor uncertainty based on perceived noise and bounding region radii. In the event of a bounding region collision between a robot and an obstacle during algorithm evaluation;  the severity of the separation failure is reported as a percentage of volume penetration.
