This paper studies automated tasks based on hybrid force/position control of a flexible object at the microscale. A guiding task of a flexible micropart is the case of the study and is achieved by a two-sensing-finger microgripper. An experimental model of the behavior of the microgripper is given and the interaction forces are studied. Based on grasp stability;  a guiding strategy taking into account the pull off forces is proposed. A specific control strategy using an external hybrid force/position control and taking into account microscale specificities is proposed. The experimental results of automated guiding task are presented.
