We present a study in human-centered automation that has potential to reduce patient side effects from high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT). To efficiently deliver radiation to the prostate while minimizing trauma to sensitive structures such as the penile bulb;  we modified the Acubot-RND 7-axis robot to guide insertion of diamond-tip needles into desired skew-line geometric arrangements. We extend and integrate two algorithms: Needle Planning with Integer Programming (NPIP) and Inverse Planning with Integer Programming (IPIP) to compute skew-line needle and dose plans. We performed three physical experiments with anatomically correct phantom models to study performance: two with the robot and one control experiment with an expert human physician (coauthor Hsu) without the robot. All were able to achieve needle arrangements that meet the RTOG-0321 clinical dose objectives with zero trauma to the penile bulb. We analyze systematic and random errors in needle placement; total RMS error for the robot system operating without feedback ranged from 2.6 to 4.3 mm;  which is comparable to the RMS error of 2.7 mm obtained in an earlier study for PPI-BT treatment using a robot with 3D ultrasound feedback.
