Process monitoring and fault diagnosis of the continuous annealing process lines (CAPLs) have been a primary concern in industry. Stable operation of the line is essential to final product quality and continuous processing of the upstream and downstream materials. In this paper;  a multilevel principal component analysis (MLPCA)-based fault diagnosis method is proposed to provide meaningful monitoring of the underlying process and help diagnose faults. First;  multiblock consensus principal component analysis (CPCA) is extended to MLPCA to model the large scale continuous annealing process. Secondly;  a decentralized fault diagnosis approach is designed based on the proposed MLPCA algorithm. Finally;  experiment results on an industrial CAPL are obtained to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
