In this paper;  double-clamped beam with a mass at the center has been fabricated on substrate of a Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafer. Thin layer SOI Field-Effect Transistors (SOI-FETs) have been integrated at ends of the beam on top layer of the SOI wafer;  which can be used for stress-sensing. Such a structure can be used as an accelerometer. The applied acceleration can be detected directly by the changing of the drain current. The measured sensitivity and noise floor of the device are 0.91 mV/g and 13 mg/Hz\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>-1/2</sup>\n. As expected performance of the SOI-FETs;  such an accelerometer can be used in a wide temperature range (-60°C to 200°C) in some special applications;  such as military;  automobile;  nuclear and well-logging industry application.
