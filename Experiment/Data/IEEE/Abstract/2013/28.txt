Dense passive radio frequency identification (RFID) systems are particularly susceptible to reader collision problems;  categorized by reader-to-tag and reader-to-reader collisions. Both may degrade the system performance decreasing the number of identified tags per time unit. Although many proposals have been suggested to avoid or handle these collisions;  most of them are not compatible with current standards and regulations;  require extra hardware and do not make an efficient use of the network resources. This paper proposes the Geometric Distribution Reader Anti-collision (GDRA);  a new centralized scheduler that exploits the Sift geometric probability distribution function to minimize reader collision problems. GDRA provides higher throughput than the state-of-the-art proposals for dense reader environments and;  unlike the majority of previous works;  GDRA is compliant with the EPCglobal standard and ETSI EN 302 208 regulation;  and can be implemented in real RFID systems without extra hardware.
