State estimation has always been important in discrete-event systems. There are two types of state estimation problems in discrete-event systems: one is to determine the initial state of the system and the other is to determine the current state of the system. In this paper;  we investigate the initial state estimation problem. We formulate initial state estimation problem as I-detectability. A discrete-event system is strongly I-detectable if we can determine the initial state of the system after a finite number of event observations for all trajectories of the system. It is weakly I-detectable if we can determine the initial state of the system for some trajectories of the system. We construct I-observer to analyze strong and weak I-detectability and construct I-detector to check strong I-detectability. For some applications;  strong I-detectability is required but not satisfied; hence we investigated how to control a system to achieve strong I-detectability if needed. If there exists a controllable;  observable;  and strongly I-detectable sublanguage;  then we say the system is closed-loop strongly I-detectable. We derive an effective algorithm to check whether a system is closed-loop strongly I-detectable. The algorithm can also calculate a controllable;  observable;  and strongly I-detectable sublanguage if the system is closed-loop strongly I-detectable.
