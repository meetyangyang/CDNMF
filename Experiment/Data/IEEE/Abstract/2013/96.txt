Reading ranges are being extended in the wake of recent advances in UHF radio frequency identification (RFID) systems;  and with the advent of larger reading ranges;  tag localization has moved into the spotlight. Recently;  we introduced a new UHF RFID tag localization technique. The proposed method is based on phase measurements taken along a synthetic aperture. A holographic image is calculated based on the scanned phase values. The image represents the spatial probability density function for the actual tag location. This paper presents this innovative method in detail. Simulations that illustrate the effect of the given trajectory are included. Extensive measurements obtained in a reflective lab environment are presented. We discuss the method's effectiveness with respect to measurement errors;  antenna phase center distortions;  and the available phase information. The results show the potential practical applications for the method in moving reader antennas;  such as handheld readers or readers mounted on vehicles like forklifts or mobile robotic systems.
