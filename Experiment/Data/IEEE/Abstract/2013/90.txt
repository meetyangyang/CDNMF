Due to complex dynamic characteristics of the ball mill system;  it is difficult to measure load parameters inside the ball mill. It has been noticed that the traditional single-model and ensemble-model based soft sensor approaches demonstrate weak generalization power. Also;  mill motor current;  feature subsets of the shell vibration and acoustical frequency spectra contain different useful information. To achieve better solutions and overcome these problems mentioned above;  a selective ensemble multisource information approach is proposed in this paper. Only the useful feature subsets of vibration and acoustical frequency spectra are portioned and selected. Some modeling techniques;  such as fast Fourier transform (FFT);  mutual information (MI);  kernel partial least square (KPLS);  brand and band (BB);  and adaptive weighting fusion (AWF);  are combined effectively to model the mill load parameters. The simulation is conducted using real data from a laboratory-scale ball mill. The results show that our proposed approach can effectively fusion the shell vibration;  acoustical and mill motor current signals with improved model generalization.
