The battery is one of the most important components in electric vehicles. In this paper;  a virtual battery model;  which provides a framework of battery simulation for electric vehicles;  is introduced. Using such a framework;  we can model and simulate the performance of a battery during its usage;  such as battery charge;  discharge;  and idle status;  the impacts of internal and external temperature;  the manufacturing quality on joints;  the cell capacity and balance management;  etc. Such a framework can provide a quantitative tool for design and manufacturing engineers to predict the battery performance;  investigate the impacts of manufacturing process;  and obtain feedback for improvement in battery design;  control;  and manufacturing processes.
