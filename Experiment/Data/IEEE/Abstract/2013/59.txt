Owing to their rapid development;  services are increasing rapidly in quantity. The consequence is that there are so many services that share the same or similar functions. Therefore;  it is important to select a credible and optimal service. Reputation as one of the important parameters of services plays a significant role in the decision support for service selection. This paper proposes a novel two-phase method to calculate service reputation. The first phase uses a dynamic weight formula to calculate reputation such that it can reflect the latest tendency of a service. The second one uses an olfactory response formula to mitigate the negative effect of unfair ratings. Some experiments are conducted and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
