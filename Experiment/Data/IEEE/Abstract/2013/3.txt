Control of production operations is considered as one of the most economical methods to improve energy efficiency in manufacturing systems. This paper investigates energy consumption reduction in production systems through effective scheduling of machine startup and shutdown. Specifically;  we consider serial production lines with finite buffers and machines having Bernoulli reliability model. This machine reliability model is applicable in production situations;  where the downtime is relatively short and comparable to machine cycle time (e.g.;  automotive paint shops and general assembly). In this paper;  using transient analysis of the systems at hand;  an analytical performance evaluation technique is developed for Bernoulli serial lines with time-dependent machine efficiencies. In addition;  tradeoff between productivity and energy-efficiency in production systems is discussed and the energy-efficient production problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. The effects and practical implications of operations schedule are demonstrated using a numerical study on automotive paint shop operations.
