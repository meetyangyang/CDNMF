This paper examines the problem of determining the distribution of a number of indistinguishable moving bodies located in regions separated by sensor beams that can detect whether a body moves across them. We characterize the conditions under which an exact distribution of bodies can be determined;  and compute bounds on the expected number of sensor observations required to determine this exact distribution for a certain movement model of the bodies.
