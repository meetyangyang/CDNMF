This paper addresses the kinematic calibration issues for a 7-DOF cable-driven humanoid arm in order to improve its motion control accuracy. The proposed 7-DOF humanoid arm has a hybrid parallel-serial kinematic structure;  which consists of three serially connected parallel cable-driven modules;  i.e.;  a 3-DOF shoulder module;  a 1-DOF elbow module;  and a 3-DOF wrist module. Due to the unique arm design features such as hybrid parallel-serial structure;  modular configuration;  and redundant sensors;  an integrated two-level self-calibration method is proposed in this work. The first level of self-calibration;  termed as the central linkage mechanism calibration;  is to identify the kinematics errors existed in the 7-DOF central linkage mechanism based on its self-motion capability. The second level of calibration;  termed as the cable-driven module calibration;  is to identify the kinematics errors existed in each of the parallel cable-driven modules based on its sensing redundancy. To simplify the formulation of the calibration algorithms;  the error model of the serial central linkage mechanism is derived from its forward kinematics;  in which the Products-Of-Exponential (POE) formula is employed;  while the error models of the parallel cable-driven modules are derived from their inverse kinematics. The simulation and experimental results have shown that the proposed self-calibration algorithms can effectively improve the accuracy of the 7-DOF cable-driven humanoid arm.
