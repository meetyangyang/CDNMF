In this paper;  a focused ion beam processing technique is presented that facilitates the modification of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in terms of length;  diameter;  and orientation. The CNTs are mounted onto an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe by using a nanorobotic microgripper-based pick-and-place handling strategy. Such CNT-enhanced AFM probes are needed for metrology measurements of nanostructures with critical dimensions and high aspect ratios. The complete process of assembly and processing is realized inside a nanorobotic dual beam scanning electron microscope (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) machine.
