This paper constructs the framework of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space for multiple kernel learning;  which provides clear insights into the reason that multiple kernel support vector machines (SVM) outperform single kernel SVM. These results can serve as a fundamental guide to account for the superiority of multiple kernel to single kernel learning. Subsequently;  the constructed multiple kernel learning algorithms are applied to model a nonlinear blast furnace system only based on its input-output signals. The experimental results not only confirm the superiority of multiple kernel learning algorithms;  but also indicate that multiple kernel SVM is a kind of highly competitive data-driven modeling method for the blast furnace system and can provide reliable indication for blast furnace operators to take control actions.
