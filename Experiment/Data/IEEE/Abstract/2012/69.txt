The drift distorts the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images as the time taken to acquire a complete AFM image is relatively long (a few minutes). As the AFM image is used as a reference for most manipulation mechanisms;  the image distorted by drift will cause problems for AFM-based manipulation because the displayed positions of the objects under nanomanipulation do not match their actual locations. The drift during manipulation;  similarly;  will further exacerbate the mismatch between the displayed positions and the actual locations. Such mismatch is a major hurdle to achieve automation in AFM-based nanomanipulation. Without proper compensation;  manipulation based on a wrong displayed location of the object often fails. In this paper;  we present an algorithm to identify and eliminate the drift-induced distortion in the AFM image by applying a strategic local scan method. Briefly;  after an AFM image is captured;  the entire image is divided into several parts along vertical direction. A quick local scan is performed in each part of the image to measure the drift value in that very part. In this manner;  the drift value is calculated in a small local area instead of the global image. Thus;  the drift can be more precisely estimated and the actual position of the objects can be more accurately identified. In this paper;  we also present the strategy to constantly compensate the drift during manipulation. By applying local scan on a single fixed feature in the AFM image frequently;  the most current positions of all objects can be displayed in the augmented reality for real-time visual feedback.
