A cellular manufacturing system is good at producing diversified products flexibly; however;  its assembly efficiency depends mainly on its operators' abilities. As the workforce shrinks in Japan;  cellular manufacturing systems are difficult to maintain. In this case;  a new assembly system has been developed since 2006 that combines both the dexterities of human operators and the advantages of automatic machinery. Its characteristics consist of three aspects: collaboration between an operator and twin manipulators on a mobile base;  assembly information guidance;  and safe design for collaboration. To meet the rapid changing tastes of customers;  operators have to assemble various products without longtime training. This requires an effective assembly skill transfer system to extract assembly skills from skilled operators;  and then transfer them to novice ones. Considering the characteristics of a cellular manufacturing system;  an assembly skill transfer system was proposed and used to extract and transfer assembly skills in both cognition and execution aspects. Taking a cable harness task as an example;  the proposed skill transfer system was applied in a developed assembly system. The results show that working under the developed assembly system with physical support;  informational support;  and the assembly skill transfer system;  novice operators' assembly performance was greatly improved. This verified the effect of the proposed solution to maintain the cellular manufacturing system in the aging Japanese society.
