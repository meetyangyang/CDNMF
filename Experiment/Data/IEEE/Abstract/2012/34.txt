Performance of data streaming applications is co-determined by both networking and computing resources;  and therefore they should be co-scheduled and co-allocated in an integrated and coordinated way. Dynamic control of resource scheduling and allocation is required;  because unilateral redundancy in either networking or computing resources may result in the overprovision of it and the other may become a bottleneck. To avoid resource shortage as well as overprovision;  in this paper;  a virtualized platform is utilized to implement data streaming and processing. In this platform;  fuzzy logic controllers are designed to allocate CPU resources; iterative bandwidth allocation is applied and is processing- and storage-aware to guarantee on-demand data provisioning. Experimental results show that our approach leads to higher application performance as well as higher resource utilization;  compared with other resource scheduling and allocation methods.
