The IEC 61499 Function Block architecture is considered as the next generation of programmable control technology promoting distributed control in automation. In this paper;  the redesign methodologies from the PLC control to the event-driven architecture of IEC 61499 function blocks are proposed. A general set of translation steps and mapping rules for redesigning applications from IEC 61131-3 PLC to IEC 61499 Function Blocks is provided. Three different redesign approaches are proposed: object-oriented conversion approach;  object-oriented reuse approach;  and class-oriented approach. These approaches are to be applied for different design styles of the source PLC code. The data handling efficiency of all approaches is investigated. An airport baggage handling system is chosen as the case study for the redesign process. The rules and limitations are summarized and guidelines for the redesign process are provided.
