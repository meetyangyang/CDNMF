We present a formal framework for robotic cooperation in which we use an extension to Petri nets;  known as workflow nets;  to establish a protocol among mobile agents based on the task coverage they maintain. Our choice is motivated by the fact that Petri nets handle concurrency and that goal reachability;  or soundness;  can be theoretically established. In particular;  we define a mathematical cooperation operator which turns cooperation problems expressed as workflow nets into algebraic representations. While we do not address the problem of efficiency;  we formally demonstrate that this framework guarantees soundness;  or goal reachability;  using workflow nets.
