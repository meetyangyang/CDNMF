With wafer residency time constraint of cluster tools in semiconductor manufacturing;  activity time variation can make an originally feasible schedule infeasible. Thus;  it is difficult to schedule them and schedulability is a vitally important issue. With bounded activity time variation considered;  this paper addresses their real-time scheduling issues and conducts their schedulability analysis. A Petri net (PN) model and a control policy are presented. Based on them;  this paper derives closed-form schedulability conditions. If schedulable;  an algorithm is developed to obtain an offline periodic schedule. This schedule together with the control policy forms a real-time schedule. It is optimal in terms of cycle time and can be analytically computed;  which represents significant advance in this area.
