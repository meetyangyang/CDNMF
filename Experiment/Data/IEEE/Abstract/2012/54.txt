Many automation or manufacturing systems are large;  complex;  and stochastic. Since closed-form analytical solutions generally do not exist for such systems;  simulation is the only faithful way for performance evaluation. From the practical engineering perspective;  the designs (or solution candidates) with low complexity (called simple designs) have many advantages compared with complex designs;  such as requiring less computing and memory resources;  and easier to interpret and to implement. Therefore;  they are usually more desirable than complex designs in the real world if they have good enough performance. Recently;  Jia (IEEE Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.;  vol. 8;  no. 4;  pp. 720-732;  Oct. 2010) discussed the importance of design simplicity and introduced an adaptive simulation-based sampling algorithm to sequentially screen the designs until one simplest good enough design is found. In this paper;  we consider a more generalized problem and introduce two algorithms OCBA-mSG and OCBA-bSG to identify a subset of m simplest and good enough designs among a total of K (K >; m) designs. By controlling the simulation allocation intelligently;  our approach intends to find those simplest good enough designs using a minimum simulation time. The numerical results show that both OCBA-mSG and OCBA-bSG outperform some other approaches on the test problems.
