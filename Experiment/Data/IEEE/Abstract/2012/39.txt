Kumar and Takai have proposed an architecture for the decentralized prognosis of discrete-event systems (DES);  where several local prognosers cooperate to predict failures in a DES. In this paper;  we first present the proposition (Kumar and Takai;  \Decentralized prognosis of failures in discrete event systems; \ IEEE Trans. Autom. Control;  vol. 55;  no. 1;  pp. 48-59;  Jan. 2010) as a disjunctive architecture;  and then we develop a conjunctive architecture which is dual and complementary to the disjunctive one. We also propose a mixed architecture that combines and generalizes the disjunctive and conjunctive architectures. We finally show that our work can be easily extended to predict a failure at least k steps before its occurrence;  for a given k >; 1.
