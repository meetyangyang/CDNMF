Outpatient scheduling is considered as a complex problem. Efficient solutions to this problem are required by many health care facilities. This paper proposes an efficient approach to outpatient scheduling by specifying a bidding method and converting it to a group role assignment problem. The proposed approach is validated by conducting simulations and experiments with randomly generated patient requests for available time slots. The major contribution of this paper is an efficient outpatient scheduling approach making automatic outpatient scheduling practical. The exciting result is due to the consideration of outpatient scheduling as a collaborative activity and the creation of a qualification matrix in order to apply the group role assignment algorithm.
