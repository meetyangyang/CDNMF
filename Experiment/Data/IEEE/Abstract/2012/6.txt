This paper presents new results on the formal design of distributed coordinating agents in a discrete-event framework. In this framework;  agents are modeled to be individually equipped with a coordination module;  through which they interact and communicate. In terms of existing control-theoretic concepts;  we first define the concept of a coordinable language and show that it is the necessary and sufficient existence condition of coordination modules for distributed agents to achieve conformance to a prespecified interagent constraint language. Following;  we present a synthesis algorithm to compute near-optimal coordination modules. An example is provided to illustrate the design synthesis using the proposed algorithm. Finally;  a discussion with related work distinguishes our coordination design problem from related problems in the literature.
