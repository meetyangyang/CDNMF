In this paper;  an efficient development environment for vertical integration of many tasks involved with robot programming;  called Open software Platform for Robotic Services (OPRoS);  is presented. It covers from the control of hardware (HW) devices to the execution of complicated application programs. Based on general software (SW) architecture;  standardized components with design patterns;  frameworks;  and servers are offered for developing robot SW applications easily and efficiently. Specially;  an easy and one-stop Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and simulation tools are provided to make the management and debugging easier;  and to check performance in advance. For an all-level development environment;  the IDE of OPRoS supports development from low-level device controls to high-level contents composition;  and hence;  many programs ranging from HW device programs to complicated applications can be developed and integrated in a single development environment. Additionally;  OPRoS makes all modules and components undergo the proper evaluation and test;  which avoids potential errors due to incomplete coding. As a comprehensive platform for robot SW applications;  OPRoS provides convenient environments for all development steps from editing through verification to execution.
