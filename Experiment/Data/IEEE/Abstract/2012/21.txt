Rapid response to clinical deterioration plays an important role to improve patient safety. In this paper;  we present an initial study on modeling and analysis of the rapid response process in acute care. Specifically;  such a process is modeled as a complex network with split;  merge;  and parallel structures. An analytical method is developed to evaluate the decision time (from detection of patient deteriorating to a doctor's decision for treatment) and its variability. Structural properties are discussed and continuous improvement methods for identification and mitigation of bottlenecks in the rapid response operations are provided. A case study at the acute care at the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital is introduced to validate the model;  and continuous improvement recommendations are investigated. Finally;  potential future work to extend the study is discussed.
