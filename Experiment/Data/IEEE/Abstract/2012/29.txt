The sequential behavior of a manufacturing system results from several constraints introduced during the product;  manufacturing;  and control logic development. This paper proposes methods and algorithms for automatically representing and visualizing this behavior from various perspectives throughout the development process. A new sequence planning approach is introduced that uses self-contained operations to model the activities and execution constraints. These operations can be represented and visualized from multiple perspectives using a graphical and formal language called Sequences of Operations (SOPs). The operations in a manufacturing system are related to each other in various ways;  due to execution constraints expressed by operation pre- and post-conditions. These operation relations include parallel;  sequence;  arbitrary order;  alternative;  and hierarchy relations. Based on the SOP language;  these relations are identified and visualized in various SOPs and sequences. A software tool;  Sequence Planner;  has been developed;  for organizing the operations into SOPs that visualize only relevant operations and relations.
