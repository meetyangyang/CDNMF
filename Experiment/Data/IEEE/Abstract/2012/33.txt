This paper establishes modular and hierarchical supervisory control theories of Fuzzy Discrete-Event Systems (FDES). It aims to resolve the horizontal and vertical complexities present in large-scale event-driven systems;  which are affected by uncertainties in their event and state representations. The modular supervisory control architecture composed of a set of noncommunicating local supervisors;  in which one supervisor is assigned for each module having its own sensing and acting capabilities. The notion of separability for languages in FDES is introduced and the property of a language specification of FDES;  termed as separably-controllable-observability;  is proposed to determine the existence of modular supervisors to the control problem. The hierarchical supervisory control architecture consists of multilevel supervisors assigned to detailed low-level and abstract high-level models of the plant. The notion of output-control-consistency is introduced for languages in FDES. Then;  the property called strictly-output-control-consistency is defined for FDES in order to maintain the hierarchical consistency between low-level and high-level FDES modules. The property of H-fuzzy observability is introduced to ensure the hierarchical consistency under the partial observation of low-level FDES. Finally;  using the established hierarchical supervisory control theory of FDES;  a behavior-based mobile robot navigation example is discussed.
