Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is a widely used testing approach for embedded systems;  where real components and/or controllers are tested in closed-loop with a simulation model. In this paper;  we generalize HIL by combining multiple simulations and real components into a Hybrid Process Simulation (HPS). An HPS is a test setup that contains at least one simulated and one actual component;  but may contain many of both. It is implemented such that each simulated component can be swapped out with its real counterpart without making changes to the existing system;  and vice versa. In this paper;  an ontology which provides a conceptual architecture is developed for an HPS;  such that a general interpretation of a manufacturing system's implementation is made possible. A formalized application method is then devised for replacing simulations with real processes and vice versa. A conceptual architecture is put forth that separates the effect of a component from its spatial essence (volume or mass). This separation allows workpieces in a manufacturing process;  for example;  to go from the physical world into the virtual world (computer simulation) and back again repeatedly. The conceptual architecture is applied to a small manufacturing line in the following scenarios: replacing a real robot with a simulated robot;  replacing a manufacturing cell with a simulated manufacturing cell;  and adding a new simulated manufacturing cell to the existing system. These applications successfully demonstrate how an HPS can be used to test a manufacturing system setup with multiple regions of real and simulated components.
