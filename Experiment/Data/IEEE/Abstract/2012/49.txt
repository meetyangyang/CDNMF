A framework and method is presented for developing a cyclic task schedule in a multifunction radar. Rather than assuming the task dwell time to be a fixed value when building the schedule;  the task dwell time is modeled as a fuzzy set to allow for increased radar schedule flexibility. An optimization model is developed for the scheduling problem and a heuristic method for its solution is proposed. The heuristic method exploits the fuzzy set model in order to intelligently adjust the task dwell times. This adjustment allows for accommodation of more tasks on the radar timeline;  thereby resulting in fewer dropped tasks. Computational results are presented to assess the behavior of the proposed scheduling method.
