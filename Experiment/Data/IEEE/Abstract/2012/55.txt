In this paper;  a new energy model is developed based on the kinematic and dynamic behaviors of a chosen machine tool. One significant benefit of the developed energy model is their inherited relationship to the design variables involved in the manufacturing processes. Without radical changes of the machine tool's structure;  the proposed model can be readily applied to optimize process parameters to reduce energy consumption. A new parallel kinematic machine Exechon is used as a case study to demonstrate the modeling procedure. The derived energy model is then used for simulation of drilling operations on aircraft components to verify its feasibility. Simulation results indicate that the developed energy model has led to an optimized machine setup which only consumes less than one-third of the energy of an average machine setup over the workspace. This approach can be extended and applied to other machines to establish their energy models for green and sustainable manufacturing.
