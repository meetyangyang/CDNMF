Because of residency time constraints and activity time variation of cluster tools;  it is very difficult to operate such integrated semiconductor manufacturing equipment. This paper addresses their real-time operational issues. To characterize their schedulability and achieve the minimum cycle time at their steady-state operation;  Petri net (PN) models are developed to describe them;  which are very compact;  and independent of wafer flow pattern. It is due to the proposed models that scheduling cluster tools is converted into determining robot wait times. A two-level operational architecture is proposed to include an offline periodic schedule and real-time controller. The former determines when a wafer should be placed into a process module for processing;  while the latter regulates robot wait times online in order to reduce the effect of activity time variation on wafer sojourn times in process modules. Therefore;  the system can adapt to activity time variation. A cluster tool derived as a not-always-schedulable system by the existing methods is shown to be always-schedulable by using the proposed novel method.
