In this paper;  the main purpose is to locate;  label;  and correspond multiple targets with the capability of ghost suppression over a multicamera surveillance system. In practice;  the challenges come from the unknown target number;  the interocclusion among targets;  and the ghost effect caused by geometric ambiguity. Instead of directly corresponding objects among different camera views;  the proposed framework adopts a fusion-inference strategy. In the fusion stage;  we formulate a posterior distribution to indicate the likelihood of having some moving targets at certain ground locations. Based on this distribution;  a systematic approach is proposed to construct a rough scene model of the moving targets. In the inference stage;  the scene model is inputted into a proposed Bayesian hierarchical detection framework;  where the target labeling;  target correspondence;  and ghost removal are regarded as a unified optimization problem subject to 3-D scene priors;  target priors;  and foreground detection results. Moreover;  some target priors;  such as target height;  target width;  and the labeling results are iteratively refined based on an expectation-maximization (EM) mechanism to further boost system performance. Experiments over real videos verify that the proposed system can systematically determine the target number;  efficiently label moving targets;  precisely locate their 3-D locations;  and effectively tackle the ghost problem.
