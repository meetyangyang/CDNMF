In this paper;  a neuro-optimal control scheme for a class of unknown discrete-time nonlinear systems with discount factor in the cost function is developed. The iterative adaptive dynamic programming algorithm using globalized dual heuristic programming technique is introduced to obtain the optimal controller with convergence analysis in terms of cost function and control law. In order to carry out the iterative algorithm;  a neural network is constructed first to identify the unknown controlled system. Then;  based on the learned system model;  two other neural networks are employed as parametric structures to facilitate the implementation of the iterative algorithm;  which aims at approximating at each iteration the cost function and its derivatives and the control law;  respectively. Finally;  a simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control approach.
