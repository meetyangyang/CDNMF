Dual-head placement machines;  which operate according to a highly complex logic;  are commonly used in circuit-card assembly lines to place large components with a high degree of accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to present a unique approach for optimizing the picking operations of a dual-head placement machine with the ultimate goal of improving the efficiency of assembly operations. Research objectives are a model that reflects relevant;  practical considerations; a solution method that can optimize problems effectively (i.e.;  within acceptable run times); and tests to establish computational benchmarks. We formulate a general integer;  set covering model;  and optimize it using column generation;  generating columns by solving a specially designed;  constrained shortest-path subproblems. Test results demonstrate the efficacy of our optimizing approach on problems of realistic size and scope.
