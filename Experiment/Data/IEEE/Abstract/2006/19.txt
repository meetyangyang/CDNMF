An automated carbon nanotube (CNT) microspotting system was developed for rapid and batch assembly of bulk multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)-based microelectromechanical system sensors. By using the dielectrophoretic and microspotting technique;  MWNT bundles were successfully and repeatedly manipulated between an array of microfabricated electrodes. Preliminary experimental results showed that more than 75% of CNT functional devices can be assembled successfully using our technique;  which is considered to be a good yield for nanodevice manufacturing. Besides;  the devices were demonstrated to potentially serve as novel thermal sensors for temperature and fluid-flow measurements. This feasible batch manufacturable method will dramatically reduce production costs and production time of nanosensing devices and potentially enable fully automated assembly of CNT-based devices.
