Distributed sensing;  a system-wide deployment of sensing devices;  has resulted in both temporally and spatially dense data-rich environments. This new technology provides unprecedented opportunities for quality and productivity improvement. This paper discusses the state-of-the-art practice;  research challenges;  and future directions related to distributed sensing. The discussion includes the optimal design of distributed sensor systems;  information criteria;  and processing for distributed sensing and optimal decision making in distributed sensing. The discussion also provides applications based on the authors' research experiences.
