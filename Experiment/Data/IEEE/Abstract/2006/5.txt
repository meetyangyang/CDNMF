Due to the rapid development of computer and sensing technology;  many measurements of process variables are readily available in manufacturing processes. These measurements carry a large amount of information about process conditions. It is highly desirable to develop a process monitoring and diagnosis methodology that can utilize this information. In this paper;  a statistical process control monitoring system is developed for a class of commonly available process measurements-cycle-based waveform signals. This system integrates the statistical process control technology and the Haar wavelet transform. With it;  one can not only detect a process change;  but also identify the location and estimate the magnitude of the process mean shift within the signal. A case study involving a stamping process demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology on the monitoring of the profile-type data.
