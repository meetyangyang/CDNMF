Addressing the increasing biomedical and pharmacological interest in multiparametric screening assays;  a concept has been developed;  which integrates multiparametric;  bioelectric;  and biochemical sensors for the analytical monitoring of intra- and extra cellular parameters and an automated imaging microscope for high-content screening into a single embedded platform. Utilizing a topology of distributed intelligences and hardware-based synchronization;  the platform concept allows precisely timed and synchronized operation of all integrated platform components. The concept is highly modular;  and its design-inherent versatility allows a multitude of platform configurations suiting widely differing user requirements. They include the future integration of probe-manipulation systems such as climate control;  fluidic systems;  and automated probe placement. Hardware-level synchronization is achieved with a newly developed digital signal processor based \Integration Control Unit; \ which runs a real-time environment and provides standard electrical interfaces to connect to other platform components. The platform can be operated \online\ by user-interactive control or precisely timed and completely automated within high-throughput applications by executing experiment protocols that have been composed in advance. Possible applications of the integrated platform employ a parallel optical and sensory monitoring of extra- and intracellular parameters;  yielding detailed insight into cellular functions and intercellular interrelations. Thus;  the proposed automated platform may develop into an enabling technology for future screening assays;  especially in the field of pharmacological drug screening.
