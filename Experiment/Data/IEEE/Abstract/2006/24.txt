This paper describes the design;  assembly;  fabrication;  and evaluation of artificial molecular machines with the goal of implementing their internal nanoscale movements within nanoelectromechanical systems in an efficient manner. These machines;  a unique class of switchable molecular compounds in the shape of bistable [2]rotaxanes;  exhibit internal relative mechanical motions of their ring and dumbbell components as a result of optical;  chemical;  or electrical signals. As such;  they hold promise as nanoactuation materials. Although micromechanical devices that utilize the force produced by switchable [3]rotaxane molecules have been demonstrated;  the current prototypical devices require a mechanism that minimizes the degradation associated with the molecules in order for bistable rotaxanes to become practical actuators. We propose a modified design in which electricity;  instead of chemicals;  is employed to stimulate the relative movements of the components in bistable [3]rotaxanes. As an initial step toward the assembly of a wholly electrically powered actuator based on molecular motion;  closely packed Langmuir-Blodgett films of an amphiphilic;  bistable [2]rotaxane have been characterized and an in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic technique has been developed to monitor molecular signatures in device settings.
