This paper describes the development of a real-time polymerase chain reaction testbed for the analysis of up to 48 1- to 2-/spl mu/L reactions in glass capillaries. It is suitable for high-throughput experimentation when used as a downstream module for ACAPELLA-5K;  an automated;  high-precision;  fluid-handling system developed in our laboratory over the past five years. The testbed features a laser-induced fluorescence scanner with high-sensitivity photomultiplier tubes for the detection of three spectral wavelengths. The scanner has a detection threshold of 1-nM fluorescein in a 1-/spl mu/L detection volume. Peltier-effect thermoelectric elements are used to control thermal cycles with a slew rate of 3/spl deg/C/s;  and a set point tracking accuracy of /spl plusmn/0.5/spl deg/C. Analyzer design and performance are presented. Experimental results show a successful detection of 3 copies//spl mu/L of the albumin gene in serial dilutions of human genomic deoxyribonucleic-acid. Detection levels down to 4 copies//spl mu/L of the t(14;18) translocation associated with the cancer follicular lymphoma;  was demonstrated in RL-7 cells.
