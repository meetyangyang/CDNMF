New multi-axis satellites allow camera imaging parameters to be set during each time slot based on competing demand for images;  specified as rectangular requested viewing zones over the camera's reachable field of view. The single frame selection (SFS) problem is to find the camera frame parameters that maximize reward during each time window. We formalize the SFS problem based on a new reward metric that takes into account area coverage and image resolution. For a set of n client requests and a satellite with m discrete resolution levels;  we give an algorithm that solves the SFS problem in time O(n/sup 2/m). For satellites with continuously variable resolution (m=/spl infin/);  we give an algorithm that runs in time O(n/sup 3/). We have implemented all algorithms and verify performance using random inputs.
