Oligo deoxyribonucleic-acid (DNA) microarrays are fabricated through in-situ chemical synthesis. Contact and fluid dynamics contribute to this process. To produce high-quality oligo DNA microarrays;  it is important to well understand the dynamics of the fabrication process. Much work has been done in understanding the chemistry principles. However;  few studies have been conducted from the mechanics point of view. This paper proposes a contact dynamics model of inkjet technology-based oligo DNA microarray spotting process. The proposed dynamics model can reasonably well explain the dynamics of the oligo DNA microarray spotting process.
