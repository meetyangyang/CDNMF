The first part of this paper develops a linear characterizationfor the space of the Petri net markings that are reachable from the initialmarking through bounded-length fireable transition sequences. Thesecond part discusses the practical implications of this result for the liveness and reversibility analysis of a particular class of Petri nets known asprocess-resource nets with acyclic, quasi-live, serializable, and reversibleprocess subnets.
