We report the development of a novel nanolithographic system that combines the design capabilities of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) software with the nanolithographic abilities of the atomic force microscope (AFM). The AFM is a powerful tool for research at the nanoscale and can be used to perform a variety of serial nanolithographic techniques. A custom-built three-axis AFM system;  designed to execute nanolithography;  has been constructed and interfaced with a CAD/CAM design environment. This technique utilizes the CAD/CAM software to create;  in a virtual design environment;  the desired nanoscale patterns. Then;  using a G-code interpreter and software algorithms to control the three-dimensional motion of the system;  the design is replicated automatically by using conventional nanolithographic procedures. In this report;  AFM-based anodization lithography on a silicon wafer and subsequent AFM imaging is used to confirm the successful automatic replication of the desired nanoscale patterns.
