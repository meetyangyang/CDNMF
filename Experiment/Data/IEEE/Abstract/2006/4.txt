In our earlier work;  we introduced a state-based approach for the diagnosis of repeatedly occurring failures in discrete event systems (DESs). Since temporal logic provides a simpler way of specifying system properties; in this paper;  a temporal-logic-based approach for diagnosing the occurrence of a repeated number of failures is developed. Linear-time temporal-logic (LTL) formulae are used to represent the specifications of DESs. Notions of prediagnosability for failures and diagnosability for repeated failures are introduced in the setting of temporal logic. A polynomial algorithm for the test of prediagnosability for failures is provided. The diagnosis problem for repeated failures in the temporal-logic setting is reduced to one in a state-based setting;  and so the prior results of a state-based repeated failure diagnosis can be applied. Finally;  a simple example is given for illustration.
