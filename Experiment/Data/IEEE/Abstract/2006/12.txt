This paper presents a droplet-ejection-based technique for synthesizing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences on different substrates;  such as glass;  plastic;  or silicon. Any DNA sequence can be synthesized by ejecting droplets of DNA bases by a self-focusing acoustic transducer (SFAT) that does not require any nozzles. An SFAT can eject liquid droplets around 3-5 /spl mu/m in diameter;  which is significantly smaller than those ejected by commercial ink jet printers and reduces the amount of reagents needed for the synthesis. An array of SFATs is integrated with microchannels and reservoirs for delivery of DNA bases to the SFATs. Poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide is patterned;  and is used as a target substrate for in situ synthesis of multiple T bases. The significant advantage of this scheme over some of the existing commercial solutions is that it can allow geneticists to synthesize any DNA sequence within hours using a computer program at an affordable cost in their own labs. This paper describes the concept and scheme of the on-demand DNA synthesis (with an acoustic ejector integrated with microfluidic components) along with the results of an actual DNA synthesis by an SFAT.
