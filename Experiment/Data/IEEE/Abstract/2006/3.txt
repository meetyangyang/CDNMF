Hybrid timed Petri nets (HTPNs) are derived to study random topology and complexity multioperational production systems where parts of one type follow the same route to produce a final product. Each production system is first decomposed into a fundamental multiproductive machine;  multiassembly and multidisassembly modules;  followed by derivation of their corresponding HTPN models. The overall system HTPN model is obtained via individual module synthesis;  satisfying system constraints. Individual module and overall HTPN models nodes (places and transitions) are calculated. Individual module and overall system model invariants are derived mathematically. Performance and possible tradeoffs due to varying operational constraints (buffer capacity;  work in process;  machine utilization;  backlog;  etc.) are investigated through extensive simulations. Results show the applicability of the proposed methodology and justify its modeling power and generality.
