Customer feedback in the form of warranty/field performance is an important direct indicator of quality and robustness of a product. Linking warranty information to manufacturing measurements can identify key design and process variables that are related to warranty failures. Warranty data have been traditionally used in reliability studies to determine failure distributions and warranty cost. This paper proposes a novel fault region localization methodology to link warranty failures to manufacturing measurements (hence;  to design and process parameters) for diagnosing warranty failures and to perform tolerance revaluation. The methodology consists of identifying relations between warranty failures and design/process variables using rough sets-based analysis on training data consisting of warranty information and manufacturing measurements. The methodology expands the rough set-based analysis by introducing parameters for inclusion of noise and uncertainty of warranty data classes. Based on the identified parameters related to the failure;  a revaluation of the original tolerances can be performed to improve product robustness. The proposed methodology is illustrated using case studies of two warranty failures from the electronics industry.
