Tolerance is almost ubiquitous during the whole product life. However how to effectively embody and interpret the semantics of tolerance in three-dimensional computer-aided design systems is still an open issue. Variational geometry is recognized as one of the most promising solution for it. And the methods for systematically and efficiently generating the variational geometries of all kinds of geometric entities with tolerances are imperative. In this paper;  a degree-of-freedom (DOF)-based approach is proposed for generating variational geometry of a hole with composite tolerances imposed on its centerline and surface at the same time. All possible combinations of tolerance requirements for a hole are discussed. And the mathematical models for variational geometries of the centerline and the surface of a hole are deduced. Furthermore two strategies for improving the efficiency of generating the variational geometry of a hole are presented. Finally;  the algorithm is implemented and some test results are given.
