In this paper;  we propose a modeling tool named Queueing Colored Petri nets (QCPN) for performance evaluation and scheduling for wafer fabrication. The main idea of this tool is to combine colored timed Petri nets with the queueing systems;  and it aims to make simulation over the model more efficient. Due to the wide acceptance of priority rules in the wafer manufacturing industry;  we also proposed a mechanism to realize priority rules in the QCPN models. Since it is known that no single rule can dominate in any circumstance;  we proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) to search for the optimal combination of a number of priority rules based on the status and performance measures of the fab. Our approach can be considered as taking the advantage of the lot execution sequence generated by priority rules to guide the search. This approach can reduce the solution space and help us find the good solution more quickly. In addition;  the QCPN-based GA scheduler can greatly reduce the computation time so that this GA scheduler can meet the need for a rapidly changing environment.
