A new 2-degrees of freedom compliant parallel micromanipulator (CPM) utilizing flexure joints is proposed for two-dimensional nanomanipulation in this paper. By a proper selection of actuators;  flexure hinges;  and materials;  this system is constructed and analyzed by a pseudorigid-body model;  architectural optimization;  and finite-element analysis. Both the position and velocity kinematic modelings are established;  and afterwards;  statics analysis is performed. In view of the physical constraints imposed by pizeo-actuators and flexure hinges;  the CPM's workspace area is determined. And in order to achieve a maximum workspace subjected to the given dexterity indices;  kinematic optimization of the design parameters is carried out;  which results in a manipulator satisfying the operational requirements. Furthermore;  the finite-element analysis has been undertaken to validate the analytical modeling;  and the influence of architectural parameters on CPM performance has been evaluated as well.
