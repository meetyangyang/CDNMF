This paper discusses the effect of geometric shape on the accuracy of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) prototypes. The percentage shrinkages due to different shapes are investigated and their empirical relationship is determined. A new speed-compensation (SC) method is proposed to reduce uneven shrinkage affected by the two-dimensional geometric shape at each layer. From case studies conducted;  the optimized SC method is found to be efficient in improving the accuracy of prototypes fabricated.
