Supervisory control for deadlock-free resource allocation has been an active area of manufacturing systems research. To date;  most work assumes that allocated resources do not fail. Little research has addressed allocating resources that may fail. In our previous work;  we assumed a single unreliable resource and developed supervisory controllers to ensure robust deadlock-free operation in the event of resource failure. In this paper;  we assume that several unreliable resources may fail simultaneously. In this case;  a controller must guarantee that a set of resource failures does not propagate through blocking to stall other portions of the system. That is;  the controller must ensure that every part type not requiring any of the failed resources should continue to produce smoothly without disruption. To do this;  the controller must constrain the system to states that serve as feasible initial states for: 1) a reduced system when resource failures occur and 2) an upgraded system when failed resources are repaired. We develop the properties that such a controller must possess and then develop supervisory controllers that satisfy these properties.
