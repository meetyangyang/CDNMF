We previously proposed a general algorithm for coordinatingthe motions among multiple machines in a shared assembly environmentbased on a constant-speed motion model. In this paper,we extend this workto a minimum-jerk polynomial motion model and describe a new speedplanning algorithm to plan automated assembly machinesâ€™ motions. Machines are planned sequentially,based on their priorities,by mapping themotions of higher-priority machines into forbidden regions in two-dimensional space-time graphs. Collision-free minimum-jerk motions are thenplanned between the forbidden regions in the graphs. The new speed-planning algorithm is evaluated on a dual-robot surface-mount technology assembly machine in which both robots share a common workspace.
