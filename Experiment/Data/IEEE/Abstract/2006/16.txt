This paper describes a new liquid dispensing/aspirating system that is capable of producing micron-size spots/droplets for molecular biology research and analysis. In particular;  the application is focused on deoxyribonucleic-acid microarray fabrication with the goals of uniform spot morphology;  smaller spot size;  higher yield;  more efficient use of biological materials;  and the capacity to handle high viscosity liquids. The new system is based on active sensing and control and it is part of a fully integrated robotic microarray system for genomic and proteomic applications. The prototype system handles thick liquids such as 100% glycerol as well as aqueous solutions and generates uniform spots in a contactless manner with controllable spot size ranging from 80 microns to 200 microns.
