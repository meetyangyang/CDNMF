In a haptic interface system with a nanoscale virtual environment (NVE) using an atomic force microscope;  not only is stability important;  but task-based performance (or fidelity) is crucial. In this paper;  we introduce a nanoscale virtual coupling (NSVC) concept and explicitly derive the relationship between performance;  stability;  and scaling factors of velocity (or position) and force. An available scaling factor region is represented based on Llewellyn's absolute stability criteria and the physical limitation of the haptic device. For the stable haptic interface;  the sampled time passivity controller is implemented in the NVE. Experiments have been performed for telenanomanipulation tasks;  such as positioning;  indenting;  and nanolithography with guaranteed stability in the NVE.
