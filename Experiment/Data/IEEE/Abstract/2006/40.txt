Manufacturing systems are inherently imperfect both statically and dynamically. Tolerance and maintenance design are two major tools to address the static and dynamic imperfection of manufacturing processes (i.e., inherent process imperfection and tooling deterioration, respectively). Yet, traditionally, tolerance and maintenance designs have been studied separately to address these two critical areas of manufacturing systems. This paper presents an integrated framework of tolerance and maintenance design for multistation manufacturing processes. Two nonlinear optimization problems are formulated to minimize the overall average production cost in the long run, which includes the tolerance cost of tooling fabrication, maintenance cost, and the overall loss of quality (as a part of the objective function or as a constraint function). The proposed methodology is illustrated, analyzed, and further discussed in the context of a multistation automotive body assembly process. Extensive numerical analyses are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed methodology. Given various cost components and time horizons, the integrated design scheme is compared with traditional design schemes in terms of cost efficiency, offering new insights into the interrelation between manufacturing process maintenance and tolerancing in the context of the product life cycle.
