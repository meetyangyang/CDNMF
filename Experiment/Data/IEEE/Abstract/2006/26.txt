Biological research requires new tools for cell micromanipulations. Currently;  biological cell sizes range from a few to hundreds of micrometers;  their manipulation therefore belonging to the field of microrobotics. This paper presents a new wireless micromanipulation system which allows cells placed in a droplet of liquid to be pushed on a glass slide. The cell micropusher is a ferromagnetic object which follows the movement of a permanent magnet located under the glass slide. It has been proved in previous works that two kinds of micropusher movements can induce a movement of the pushed object: turning the micropusher around the contact point (rotation);  or moving the micropusher in translation. Rotation allows an object to be placed with a precision below 1 /spl mu/m;  but acts within a narrow range. Translation allows placement of an object with lower accuracy;  but within a wide range. We propose a specific coarse-fine control strategy to push an object;  with good precision;  within a wide range. Furthermore;  experimentation on polystyrene balls of 50 /spl mu/m in diameter;  and immature human oocytes of 150 /spl mu/m in diameter are presented.
