Nanoassembly using atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a promising technique for nanomanufacturing. Most AFM-based nanoassembly schemes are implemented either manually using haptic devices or in an interactive way between the users and the atomic force microscope images. These schemes are time consuming and inefficient. Therefore;  the computer-aided design (CAD)-guided automated nanoassembly using AFM is desirable for nanomanufacturing. In this paper;  a general framework for CAD-guided automated nanoassembly using AFM is developed. Based on the CAD model of a nanostructure;  the manipulation paths for both nanoparticles and nanorods are generated automatically. A local scanning method is developed to compensate for the random drift that may cause the failure of the nanoassembly. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed general framework can be employed to manufacture nanostructures efficiently. The research work opens a door to the CAD-guided automated nanomanufacturing using AFM.
