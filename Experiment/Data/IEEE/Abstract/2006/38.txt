Today, machining systems are complex multistation manufacturing systems that involve a large number of machining operations and several locating datum changes. Dimensional errors introduced at each machining operation get transformed and cause the occurrence of new errors as the workpiece propagates through the machining system. The appropriate choice of measurements in such a complex system is crucial for the subsequent successful identification of the root causes of machining errors hidden in dimensional measurements of the workpiece. In order to facilitate this measurement selection process, methods for quantitative characterization of measurement schemes must be developed. This problem of quantitative measurement characterization referred to as the measurement scheme analysis problem is dealt with in this paper. The measurement scheme analysis is accomplished through characterization of the maximal achievable accuracy of estimation of process-level parameters based on the measurements in a given measurement scheme. The stream of variation methodology is employed to establish a connection between the process-level parameters and measured product quality. Both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian assumptions in the estimation are considered and several analytical properties are derived. The properties of the newly derived measurement scheme analysis methods are demonstrated in measurement scheme characterization in the multistation machining system used for machining of an automotive cylinder head.
