<para xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> This paper presents a decision-making approach towards adaptive setup planning that considers both the availability and capability of machines on a shop floor. It loosely integrates scheduling functions at the setup planning stage;  and utilizes a two-step decision-making strategy for generating machine-neutral and machine-specific setup plans at each stage. The objective of the research is to enable adaptive setup planning for dynamic job shop machining operations. Particularly;  this paper covers basic concepts and algorithms for one-time generic setup planning;  and run-time final setup merging for dynamic machine assignments. The decision-making algorithms validation is further demonstrated through a case study. </para>.
