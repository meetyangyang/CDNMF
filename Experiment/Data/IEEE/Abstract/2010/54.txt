For practical automated manufacturing systems (AMSs);  the time dimension is of great significance and should be integrated in their plant models. Reasonably;  many of the realistic general mutual exclusion constraints (GMECs) imposed on these discrete models should be timed rather than merely algebraic or logic. In the past;  such a problem was studied on the basis of the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control technique (SCT) and the theory of regions. It proves to be NP-hard since it necessitates the generation of reachability graphs. This paper shows that it can be solvable in polynomial time by using generalized linear constraints;  which are originally proposed to increase the expressive power of the linear marking constraints. By dividing each constraint into marking;  firing vector;  and Parikh terms;  its respective control place can be synthesized algebraically without considering the separation of dangerous states and events. Several examples are used to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
