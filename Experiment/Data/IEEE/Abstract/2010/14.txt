A framework is introduced for monitoring the interrupting faults in the timed discrete events systems. We introduce the notion of acceptable behavior of the system subjected to these faults: permanent or intermittent. The acceptable behavior of a system is modeled by a stopwatch automaton. The timed sub-spaces in the locations of the automaton delimit exactly the range of the acceptable behavior. They are synthesized using the techniques of reachability analysis of stopwatch automata in a way to detect the system faults as early as possible.
