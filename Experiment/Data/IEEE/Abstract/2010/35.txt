Airport baggage handling is a field of automation systems that is currently dependent on centralized control systems and conventional automation programming techniques. In this and other areas of manufacturing and materials handling;  these legacy automation technologies are increasingly limiting for the growing demand for systems that are reconfigurable;  fault tolerant;  and easy to maintain. IEC 61499 Function Blocks is an emerging architectural framework for the design of distributed industrial automation systems and their reusable components. A number of architectures have been suggested for multiagent and holonic control systems that incorporate function blocks. This paper presents a multiagent control approach for a baggage handling system (BHS) using IEC 61499 Function Blocks. In particular;  it focuses on demonstrating a decentralized control system that is scalable;  reconfigurable;  and fault tolerant. The design follows the automation object approach;  and produces a function block component representing a single section of conveyor. In accordance with holonic principles;  this component is autonomous and collaborative;  such that the structure and the behavior of a BHS can be entirely defined by the interconnection of these components within the function block design environment. Simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agent-based control system and a utility is presented for real-time viewing of these systems. Tests on a physical conveyor test system demonstrated deployment to embedded control hardware.
