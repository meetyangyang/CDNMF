In this paper;  we focus on a batch manufacturing system with multiple industrial robots. In this system;  material-handling robots (MHRs) and material-processing robots (MPRs) are operating. Since various operations are conducted at certain places;  one of them might include a localized bottleneck. A localized bottleneck is a constraint that dominates the maximum amount of production in a system;  that is;  the productivity. In addition;  the bottleneck induces congestion; as a result;  the productivity declines. For these issues;  there are two primary challenges: bottleneck prevention and restraint. To solve them;  suitable operational techniques with respect to the MHRs and MPRs are needed in order for them to operate appropriately while relating to each other. In this paper;  a constructive approach toward multi-robot coordination problems is taken. In this approach;  we propose applicable operational techniques for the robots. Through simulation experiments;  we examine the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and their combinations and;  finally;  show an integrated operational technique. Each of the operational techniques solves a localized bottleneck and the congestion;  and the integrated technique successfully improves the productivity and results in the most efficient system.
