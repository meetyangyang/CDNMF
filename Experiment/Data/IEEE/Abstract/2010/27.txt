<para xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> This paper deals with the generation of smooth paths planned by means of <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex Notation=\TeX\>$ { \\mmb{\\eta } }^{3}$</tex> </formula>-splines;  a recently devised planning primitive used for the automated steering of wheeled mobile robots. The shape of <formula formulatype=\inline\> <tex Notation=\TeX\>$ { \\mmb{\\eta } }^{3}$</tex></formula>-splines can be easily modified by acting on a set of free parameters. This capability can be used;  for example;  to satisfy an assigned optimality criterion. In this paper;  it will be used to minimize the curvature variability in order to reduce the lateral solicitations affecting an autonomous robot. Evidently;  curvature derivative could be minimized by means of an optimization algorithm. However;  this approach cannot be suitably used in an online application which continuously requires the curve updating. For this reason;  a heuristic method;  based on closed form expressions;  has been devised and proposed in the paper in order to efficiently generate almost optimal curves on the sole basis of the interpolating conditions. As a further characteristic;  the proposed heuristic expressions permit obtaining;  when appropriate interpolating conditions are given;  <formula formulatype=\inline\><tex Notation=\TeX\>$ { \\mmb{\\eta } }^{3}$</tex></formula>-splines which at best emulate circular arcs and clothoids. </para>.
