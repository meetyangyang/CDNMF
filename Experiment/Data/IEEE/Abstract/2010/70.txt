Performance evaluation of complex manufacturing systems is challenging due to many factors such as system complexity;  parameter uncertainties;  problem size;  just to name a few. In many cases when a system is too complex to model using mathematical formulas;  simulation is used as an effective alternative to conduct system analysis. A manufacturing system is a good example of such cases where both system performance and system complexity are greatly impacted by material handling (MH) strategy;  management;  and operational control. In this paper;  we study vehicle general assembly (GA) system with MH;  and focus on developing an efficient simulation method for modeling and analysis where traditional simulation methods may suffer from computation intensity. Making use of the partial system decomposability;  we introduce an aggregated event-scheduling simulation method with two-level framework. A dividing mechanism with boundary conditions is employed in top-level simulation to divide the global event list into small sizes. A timing-focuses strategy based on max-plus algebra is applied in bottom-level local simulation to further reduce local event lists. With this new method it is possible to mimic real production systems fast and accurately within a reasonable computational time frame. The effectiveness and efficiency of the new simulation method are validated through experimental results.
