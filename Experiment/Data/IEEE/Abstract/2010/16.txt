This paper presents a method of geo-referencing the video data acquired by a small low-cost UAV;  which is specifically designed as an economical;  moderately functional;  small airborne platform intended to meet the requirement for fast-response to time-critical events in many small private sectors or government agencies for the small areas of interest. The developed mathematical model for geo-locating video data can simultaneously solve the video camera's interior orientation parameter (IOP) (including lens distortion);  and the exterior orientation parameters (EOPs) of each video frame. With the experimental data collected by the UAV at the established control field located in Picayune;  Mississippi;  the results reveal that the boresight matrix;  describing the relationship between attitude sensor and video camera;  in a low-cost UAV system will not be able to remain a constant. This result is inconsistent with the calibrated results from the previous airborne mapping system because the boresight matrix was usually assumed to be a constant over an entire mission in a traditional airborne mapping system. Thus;  this paper suggests that the exterior orientation parameters of each video frame in a small low-cost UAV should be estimated individually. With the developed method;  each video is geo-orthorectified and then mosaicked together to produce a 2-D planimetric mapping. The accuracy of the 2-D planimetric map can achieve 1-2 pixels;  i.e.;  1-2 m;  when comparing with the 43 check points measured by differential GPS (DGPS) survey.
