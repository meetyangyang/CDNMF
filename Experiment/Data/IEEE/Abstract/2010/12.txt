<para xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> The performance of a mobile working machine is strongly dependent on the skills of the operator. It is commonly accepted that among operators;  productivity may vary tens of percents. This research considers the human skill evaluation in working machines during normal work. A general framework for skill evaluation via task sequence recognition by a hidden Markov model (HMM) is described. The definitions of skill metrics;  based on task resource consumption;  task completion frequency;  task difficulty;  and ability to plan and make decisions;  are given and justified through an example. The skill evaluation methods are illustrated by utilizing them in two industrial applications. </para>.
