This paper describes a case study of the development and testing of a prototype system to support condition-based maintenance of the door systems of airport transportation vehicles. Every door open/close cycle produces a ¿signature¿ that can indicate the current degradation level of the door system. A combined statistical and neural network approach was used. Time;  electrical current and voltage signals from the open/close cycles are processed in real-time to estimate;  using the neural network;  the condition of the door set relative to maintenance needs. Data collection hardware for the vehicle was designed;  developed and tested to monitor door characteristics to quickly predict degraded performance;  and to anticipate failures. The prototype system was installed on vehicle door sets at the Pittsburgh International Airport and tested for several months under actual operating conditions.
