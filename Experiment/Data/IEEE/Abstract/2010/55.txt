This research result consists of two parts: one is general theory on causality assignment for hybrid bond graph (HBG) and another is application of this concept to the quantitative fault diagnosis. From Low et al.;  2008;  a foundation for quantitative bond graph-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) design using HBG is laid. Useful causality properties pertaining to the HBG from FDI perspectives;  and the concept of diagnostic hybrid bond graph (DHBG) which is advantageous for efficient and effective FDI applications are proposed. This paper is a continuation of our previous paper (Low et al.;  2008). Here;  the DHBG is exploited to analyze the hybrid system's fault detectability and fault isolability. Additionally;  a quantitative FDI framework for effective fault diagnosis for hybrid systems is proposed. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate some key concepts of the quantitative hybrid bond graph-based FDI framework.
