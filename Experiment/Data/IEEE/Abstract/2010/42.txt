The need for computational resources capable of processing geospatial data has accelerated the uptake of geospatial web services. Several academic and commercial organizations now offer geospatial web services for data provision;  coordinate transformation;  geocoding and several other tasks. These web services adopt specifications developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) - the leading standardization body for Geographic Information Systems. In parallel with efforts of the OGC;  the Grid computing community has published specifications for developing Grid applications. The Open Grid Forum (OGF) is the main body that promotes interoperability between Grid computing systems. This study examines the integration of Grid services and geospatial web services into workflows for Geoscientific processing. An architecture is proposed that bridges web services based on the abstract geospatial architecture (ISO19119) and the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA). The paper presents a workflow management system;  called SAW-GEO;  that supports orchestration of Grid-enabled geospatial web services. An implementation of SAW-GEO is presented;  based on both the Simple Conceptual Unified Flow Language (SCUFL) and the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (WS-BPEL or BPEL for short).
