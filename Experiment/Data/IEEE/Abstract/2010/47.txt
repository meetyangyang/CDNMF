Tracking objects that move fast with respect to their size is challenging because it necessitates large field of views often incompatible with the required spatial and temporal resolutions. Here;  we present a novel computer vision system that overcomes this tradeoff by employing a camera with dynamic region-of-interest (ROI) capabilities;  combined with an efficient predictive approach. We apply this method to extract the wing kinematics of tethered flying fruit flies in real time. At each frame;  only the pixels immediately surrounding the wing are exposed;  and the wing position is extracted. It is then fed to an extended Kalman filter that extracts four key parameters of the measurement time-course and;  therefore;  provides real-time feedback of wing motion. Using this approach;  we are able to sample the wing position of both wings at 7 kHz in a 2500 pixel ROI. Our methods promise new applications that can be implemented in general purpose digital hardware for high performance tracking and process control in a broad range of applications in technology and science.
