The objective of our study is to develop a safety measure that ensures smooth control mode switching of an intelligent assist device (IAD)-Skill-Assist for the purpose of effective automotive manufacturing. Smooth switching;  i.e.;  switching without abrupt deceleration;  from the hands-off control mode (used for automatic travel) to the hands-on control mode (as typified by a power-assist control mode) is expected to enhance the productivity of IADs. However;  the hazardous behaviors;  i.e.;  careless behaviors that disregard an approaching IAD in hands-off control mode might cause collision and serious injuries to a human operator. For safety purposes;  we focused on the operator's gesture of reaching for the force sensor of the Skill-Assist. Laser range sensors were employed to recognize the reaching gesture during control mode switching. A reaching gesture recognition algorithm;  based on a hidden Markov model;  processes characteristic patterns acquired by the laser range sensors;  and judges the operator safety. Experimental results suggest that the Skill-Assist to which the proposed safety measure was applied could recognize the reaching gesture of an operator when the control mode was smoothly switched. In an experiment on hazardous behavior;  the Skill-Assist could predict that the operator would be unsafe.
