At the port-of-entry;  containers are inspected through a specific sequence of sensor stations to detect the presence of radioactive materials;  biological and chemical agents;  and other illegal cargo. The inspection policy;  which includes the sequence in which sensors are applied and the threshold levels used at the inspection stations;  affects the probability of misclassifying a container as well as the cost and time spent in inspection. This work is an extension of a paper by Elsayed et al.;  which considers an inspection system operating with a Boolean decision function combining station results. In this paper;  we present a multiobjective optimization approach to determine the optimal sensor arrangement and threshold levels;  while considering cost and time. The total cost includes cost incurred by misclassification errors and the total expected cost of inspection;  while the time represents the total expected time a container spends in the inspection system. Examples which apply the approach in various systems are presented.
