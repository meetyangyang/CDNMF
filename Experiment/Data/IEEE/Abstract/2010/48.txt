Given an existing stock allocation in an inventory system;  it is often necessary to perform reallocation over multiple time points to address inventory imbalance and maximize availability. In this paper;  we focus on the situation where there are two opportunities to perform reallocation within a replenishment cycle. We derive a mathematical model to determine when and how to perform reallocation. Furthermore;  we consider the extension of this model to the situation allowing an arbitrary number of reallocations. Experimental results show that the two-reallocation approach achieves better performance compared with the single-reallocation approach found in the literature. We also illustrate how to apply the proposed model to design cost-optimal periodic resupply policies.
