In many flexible manufacturing systems;  batch production is often adopted to improve product quality. For example;  in automotive paint shops;  vehicles with same colors are typically grouped into small batches to reduce quality degradation and purge cost due to color change. In this paper;  we present an analytical method to evaluate the quality performance of flexible manufacturing systems with batch operations. In addition;  we investigate the impact of product sequencing and batch policies on product quality and present some insights to achieve better quality using these policies.
