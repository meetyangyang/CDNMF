In this paper;  we focus on the opportunistic maintenance of an asset which is composed of multiple nonidentical life-limited components with both economic and structural dependence. Besides the random asset failure;  each component also has independent failure with constant rate. Both finite and infinite horizons are considered. We first prove the optimality of the Generalized Strict Shortest-Remaining-Lifetime-First (GSSRLF) rule to efficiently reduce the size of the action space from O(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>n</sup>\n) to O(II\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i=1</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>m</sup>\n= n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n);  where n is the number of components;  m is the number of modules;  and n_i is the number of components in module i . Then;  we show that the GSSRLF rule is more general than the existing SRLF rule;  and has close relationship with several other rules and properties known in literature. Finally;  we discuss the limitations of the GSSRLF rule and use numerical results to show that even when the rule is not optimal;  it helps to identify good policies.
