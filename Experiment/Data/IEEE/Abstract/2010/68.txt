Involute spline couplings are used to transmit torque from a shaft to a hub or other rotating component. In theory;  all teeth of the spline share the load equally. In practice;  due to manufacturing variations;  the teeth are unequally loaded. A new model for tooth engagement;  based on statistics;  predicts that the teeth engage in a sequence;  determined by the individual clearances. As the shaft load is applied;  the tooth pair with the smallest clearance engages first;  then deflects as the load increases;  until the second pair engage. The two engaged pairs deflect together until the third pair engage;  and so on;  until the full load is reached. The statistical model predicts the average number of teeth which will engage for a specified load;  plus or minus the expected variation. It also quantitatively predicts the load and stress in each engaged pair. Critical factors in the model are the stiffness and deflection of a single tooth pair and the characterization of the clearance. Detailed finite element analyses were conducted to verify the tooth deflections and engagement sequence. This model has led to a simple closed-form solution that has been implemented in a spreadsheet to allow designers to predict the load in spline teeth based upon the characteristics of the spline.
