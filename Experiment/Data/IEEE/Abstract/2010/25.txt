We demonstrate that flow line models with deterministic service times and an arbitrary arrival process may be exactly decomposed into segments that each exhibit similar behavior. We call the segments \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>channels</i>\n and demonstrate that this decomposition leads to a recursion for the delay experienced by customers within the system. The consequence;  in addition to clearly elucidating the manner in which customers advance;  is that the state of a flow line at any time can be completely characterized by a handful of parameters per channel. The recursions and channel decomposition allow us to model a class of state dependent failures that are common in certain cluster tools in semiconductor wafer manufacturing. Using the fact that wafers are typically grouped into batches;  we are able to reduce the computation required to simulate the wafer advancement by about 50 times. The models have been tested with data from a clustered photolithography tool in production and provide throughput and process time predictions within 0.5% and 3% of the actual performance;  respectively.
