Under Service Oriented Architecture (SOA);  service composition is used to integrate service components together to meet new business needs. In this paper;  we propose a novel data-driven method to provide service composition guidance to implement given requirements. Based on the relations between business domain data and service domain data;  we generate additional data mediations according to three composition rules. With these data relations and composition rules;  we propose a Petri-net based approach to the composition of services. In our approach;  all the in/output messages of the service operations are modeled as colored places;  and service operations themselves are modeled as transitions with input/output places. We first generate a Service Net (SN) that contains all operations in a given service portfolio;  and then use Petri-net decomposition techniques to derive a subnet of SN;  and this subnet meets the need of the business requirement. Our work can be seen as an effort to bridge the gap between business and service domains.
