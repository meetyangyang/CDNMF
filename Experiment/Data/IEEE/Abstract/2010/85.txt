This paper proposes the concept of Key-resource/operation-place Pairs (KP) of S\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\nPR (systems of simple sequential processes with resources). Based on KP;  two policies are presented to prevent deadlocks in flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) that can be modeled by S\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\nPR. The idea is to control some key resource places only to guarantee that all strict minimal siphons (SMS) never become empty;  thereby making the controlled system live. It enables one to design two easy-to-implement control policies. The first one can guarantee that the controlled system is live;  and the second one can also make the controlled system live if there is no SMS containing any control place in the controlled system. At last;  a well-known FMS example is used to illustrate the proposed concept and policies.
