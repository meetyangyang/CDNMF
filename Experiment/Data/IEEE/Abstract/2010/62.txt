Parameter prediction is an important data mining problem and has many applications. Considering the difficulty for the conventional parameter prediction methods to deal with numeric and categorical inputs;  this paper proposes a new Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based parameter prediction method that can well tackle such inputs. First;  it introduces a Firing-strength Transform Matrix (FTM) into the generation mechanism of firing strengths of fuzzy rules in standard ANFIS in order that the categorical inputs can be handled. Next;  a new training algorithm of the structural parameters in the premise/consequent parts of fuzzy rules and FTM in the new ANFIS is proposed. Moreover;  to reduce the number of structural parameters to be learned in the new ANFIS with high-dimensional inputs;  this paper presents a fuzzy c-means method based on a binary tree linear division method for identifying the structure of the new ANFIS. Then;  numerical comparisons are made;  and the results show that the performance of the new ANFIS has significant advantages over that of the Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP)-based parameter prediction method. Finally;  the proposed method is applied to predict the trim-beam numbers in an industrial textile scheduling process.
