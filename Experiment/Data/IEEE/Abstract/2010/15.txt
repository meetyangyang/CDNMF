This paper presents a dynamic routing method for supervisory control of multiple automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that are traveling within a layout of a given warehouse. In dynamic routing a calculated path particularly depends on the number of currently active AGVs' missions and their priorities. In order to solve the shortest path problem dynamically;  the proposed routing method uses time windows in a vector form. For each mission requested by the supervisor;  predefined candidate paths are checked if they are feasible. The feasibility of a particular path is evaluated by insertion of appropriate time windows and by performing the windows overlapping tests. The use of time windows makes the algorithm apt for other scheduling and routing problems. Presented simulation results demonstrate efficiency of the proposed dynamic routing. The proposed method has been successfully implemented in the industrial environment in a form of a multiple AGV control system.
