This paper presents a robust methodology for constrained motion tracking control of piezo-actuated flexure-based four-bar micro/nano manipulation mechanisms. This unique control approach is established for the tracking of desired motion trajectories in a constrained environment exhibiting some degree of uncertain stiffness. The control methodology is also formulated to accommodate not only the parametric uncertainties and unknown force conversion function;  but also nonlinearities including the hysteresis effect and external disturbances in the motion systems. In this paper;  the equations for the dynamic modelling of a flexure-hinged four-bar micro/nano manipulation mechanism operating in a constrained environment are established. A lumped parameter dynamic model that combines the piezoelectric actuator and the micro/nano manipulation mechanism is developed for the formulation of the control methodology. Stability analysis of the proposed closed-loop system is conducted;  and the convergence of the motion tracking errors is proven theoretically. Furthermore;  precise motion tracking ability in following a desired motion trajectory is demonstrated in the experimental study. This robust constrained motion tracking control methodology is very useful for the development of high performance flexure-based micro/nano manipulation applications demanding high-precision motion tracking with force sensing and feedback.
