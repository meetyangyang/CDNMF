The feedforward compensation of nonlinearities;  i.e.;  hysteresis and creep;  and unwanted vibrations in micromanipulators is presented in this paper. The aim is to improve the general performances of piezocantilevers dedicated to micromanipulation/microassembly tasks. While hysteresis is attenuated using the Prandtl-Ishlinskii inverse model;  a new method is proposed to decrease the creep phenomenon. As no model inversion is used;  the proposed method is simple and easy to implement. Finally;  we employ an input shaping technique to reduce the vibration of the piezocantilevers. The experimental results show the efficiency of the feedforward techniques and their convenience to the micromanipulation/microassembly requirements.
