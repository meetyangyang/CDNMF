This paper considers a fleet of identical units where each unit consists of the same critical components. The degradation state of each critical component is assumed to be monitored by an on-board sensor. The paper presents a methodology for identifying the top-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n (the \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n most reliable) units in a fleet using sensor-based prognostic information. Specifically;  we develop a prognostics-based ranking (PBR) algorithm that combines stochastic degradation models with computer science database ranking algorithms. The stochastic degradation modeling framework is used to compute and update;  in real-time;  residual life distributions (RLDs) of the critical components of each unit. Using a base case exponential degradation model;  we identify conditions necessary to establish stochastic ordering among the RLDs of similar components. A preference relationship;  consistent with the stochastic ordering results;  is then used to sort the units of the fleet based on the RLDs of their respective components. A database ranking algorithm;  known as the threshold algorithm (TA);  is then used to identify the top-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n units without necessarily computing all the RLDs. The paper concludes with an illustrative example.
