Reentrant lines are widely used in many manufacturing systems. In this paper;  we present an iterative method to approximate the performance of reentrant lines with Bernoulli reliability model under last buffer first serve (LBFS) scheduling policy. Recursive procedure to estimate the production rates of reentrant lines is developed. A case study of an automotive ignition component line with reentrant washing operations is introduced to illustrate the applicability of the method.
