Concurrent engineering (CE) is a methodology applied to product lifecycle development so that high quality;  well designed products can be provided at lower prices and in less time. Many research works have been proposed for efficiently modeling of different domains in CE. However;  an integration of these works with consistent data flow is absent and still in great demand in industry. In this paper;  we present a generic integration framework with a semantic feature model for knowledge representation and reasoning across domains in CE. An implementation of the proposed semantic feature model is presented to demonstrate its advantage in knowledge representation by feature transformation across domains in CE.
