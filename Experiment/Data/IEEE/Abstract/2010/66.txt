Active control for dimensional variation reduction in multistage assembly processes (MAPs) is a challenging issue for quality assurance. It is desirable to implement a system-level control strategy to minimize the end-of-line product variance;  which is propagated from upstream manufacturing stages. Research has been conducted to realize such objective;  based on the variation propagation models derived from the nominal parameters of product and process design. However;  due to the uncertainties induced by the significant changes of process parameters;  such designated model will be different from that of the actual process;  and will not precisely represent the actual physics of the process. This model discrepancy may lead to the performance deterioration of the controllers. This paper proposed a feed-forward MAP control strategy that explicitly takes into account the uncertainties of model coefficients. The case study demonstrates that;  when the model uncertainties are significant;  the controller derived from the proposed approach outperforms that derived without considering the model uncertainty.
