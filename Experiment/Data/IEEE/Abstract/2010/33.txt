This paper formulates an integer program to design a surveillance system for port and waterway security. The model represents relevant practical considerations and prescribes the types of sensors;  the number of each type;  and the location of each sensor to meet surveillance requirements while minimizing total cost. A Branch-and-Price decomposition approach is formulated to solve the problem and effective implementation techniques are identified. Data representing the Houston Ship Channel is used as a test bed to benchmark relative to a commercial solver;  analyze the influence of parameters on run time;  and explore the relevant sensitivity of system cost to parameters.
