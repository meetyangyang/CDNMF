An autonomous distributed control algorithm for multiple spacecraft performing simultaneous close proximity maneuvers has been developed. Examples of these maneuvers include automated on-orbit inspection;  assembly;  or servicing. The proposed control algorithm combines the control effort efficiency of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and the robust collision avoidance capability of the Artificial Potential Function (APF) method. The LQR control effort serves as the attractive force toward goal positions;  while APF-based repulsive functions provide collision avoidance for both fixed and moving obstacles. Comprehensive validation and performance evaluation of the control algorithm is conducted by numerical simulations. The simulation results show the developed LQR/APF algorithm to be both robust and efficient for controlling multiple spacecraft during simultaneous docking maneuvers.
