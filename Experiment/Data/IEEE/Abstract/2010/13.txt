This paper proposes a procedure for process parameters design by combining both modeling and optimization methods. The proposed procedure integrates the Taguchi method;  the artificial neural network (ANN);  and the genetic algorithm (GA). First;  the Taguchi method is applied to minimize experimental numbers and to collect experimental data representing the quality performances of a system. Next;  the ANN is used to build a system model based on the data from the Taguchi experimental method. Then;  the GA is employed to search for the optimal process parameters. A process parameters design for a titanium dioxide (TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sub>\n) thin film in the vacuum sputtering process is studied in this paper. The quality objective is to form a smaller water contact angle on the TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sub>\n thin-film surface. The water contact angle is 4째 obtained from the system model of the proposed procedure. The process parameters obtained from the proposed procedure were used to conduct the experiment in the vacuum sputtering process for the TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sub>\n thin film. The water contact angle given from the practical experiment is 3.93째. The difference percent is 1.75% between 4째 and 3.93째. The result obtained from the system model of the proposed procedure is promising. Hence;  we can conclude that the proposed procedure is a very good approach in solving the problem of the process parameters design.
