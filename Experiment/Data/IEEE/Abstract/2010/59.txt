This paper presents a novel multiagent approach to automating taxi dispatch that services current bookings in a distributed fashion. The existing system in use by a taxi operator in Singapore and elsewhere;  attempts to increase customer satisfaction locally;  by sequentially dispatching nearby taxis to service customers. The proposed dispatch system attempts to increase customer satisfaction more globally;  by concurrently dispatching multiple taxis to the same number of customers in the same geographical region;  and \n<b xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>vis-Ã -vis</b>\n human driver satisfaction. To realize the system;  a multiagent architecture is proposed;  populated with software collaborative agents that can actively negotiate on behalf of taxi drivers in groups of size N for available customer bookings. Theoretically;  an analysis of the boundary and optimal multiagent taxi-dispatch situations is presented along with a discussion of their implications. Experimentally;  the operational efficiency of the existing and proposed dispatch systems was evaluated through computer simulations. The empirical results;  obtained for a 1000-strong taxi fleet over a discrete range of N ;  show that the proposed system can dispatch taxis with reduction in customer waiting and empty taxi cruising times of up to 33.1% and 26.3%;  respectively; and up to 41.8% and 41.2% reduction when a simple negotiation speedup heuristic was applied.
