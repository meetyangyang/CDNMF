Diffractive gratings are often associated with the use of beam shaping device utilizing a monochromatic source. They could provide high flexibility in design and offer a precise control according to applications. The design of diffraction grating often makes several iterations through design and prototyping before completion. In this paper;  we demonstrate a computer-aided design method and a mechanical method of prototyping diffractive grating optics for beam shaping;  which aim at improve productivity through greater design flexibility;  rapid fabrication and cost reduction. A description of the optical design is presented along with a discussion on the integrated patterning system.
