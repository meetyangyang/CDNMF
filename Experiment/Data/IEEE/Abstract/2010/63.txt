The facility location problem has been studied in many industries including banking network;  chain stores;  and wireless network. Maximal covering location problem (MCLP) is a general model for this type of problems. Motivated by a real-world banking facility optimization project;  we propose an enhanced MCLP model which captures the important features of this practical problem;  namely;  varied costs and revenues;  multitype facilities;  and flexible coverage functions. To solve this practical problem;  we apply an existing hybrid nested partitions algorithm to the large-scale situation. We further use heuristic-based extensions to generate feasible solutions more efficiently. In addition;  the upper bound of this problem is introduced to study the quality of solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
