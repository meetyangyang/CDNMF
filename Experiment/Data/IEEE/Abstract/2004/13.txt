Planning a proper set of contact points on a given object/workpiece so as to satisfy a certain optimality criterion is a common problem in grasp synthesis for multifingered robotic hands and in fixture planning for manufacturing automation. In this paper;  we formulate the grasp planning problem as optimization problems with respect to three grasp quality functions. The physical significance and properties of each quality function are explained;  and computation of the corresponding gradient flows is provided. One noticeable property of some of these quality functions is that the optimal solutions are also force-closure grasps if they do exist for the given object. Furthermore;  when specialized to two-fingered or three-fingered grasps on a spherical object;  the optimal solutions become the familiar antipodal grasp;  or the symmetric grasp;  respectively. Thus;  by following the gradient flows with arbitrary initial conditions;  the optimal grasp synthesis problem is solved for objects with smooth geometries manipulated by hands with any number of fingers. Also;  note that our solutions do not involve linearization of the friction cones. We discuss two simplified versions of these problems when real-time solutions are needed;  e.g. coordinated manipulation of a robotic hand with contact points servoing. We give simulation and experimental results illustrating validity of the proposed approach for optimal grasp planning.
