A holonic manufacturing system;  designed to realize agile manufacturing;  must (be able to) integrate the entire range of manufacturing activities from ordering;  through design;  modeling;  production;  to delivery. These activities are performed at many distributed sites. In order to effectively integrate these distributed sites;  this work adopts distributed object and mobile object technologies;  RosettaNet implementation framework;  as well as holon and holarchy concepts derived from studying social organizations and living organisms to develop a holonic information coordination system (HICS). The generic holon is first developed by adopting the technologies of the distributed object-oriented approach with common object request broker architecture infrastructure;  n-tier client/server architecture;  a knowledge base;  and data warehousing to achieve the properties of holon;  error recovery;  and security certification. The communication holon (CH) is then generated by inheriting the generic holon. Finally;  CHs are employed to establish HICS. The CH exhibits basic holonic attributes;  such as intelligence;  autonomy;  and cooperation. Furthermore;  the CH can handle partner interface processes;  and data exchange by various data formats following the standards of RosettaNet business messages. The failure recovery mechanism of the CH causes HICS to be more reliable than legacy systems. As such;  HICS can meet the future requirements of supply-chain information integration of virtual enterprises.<br><br>
