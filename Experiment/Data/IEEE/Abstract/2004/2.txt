This paper describes the development of an intelligent energy management network (IEMN) using the concept of a surrogate object-communication model and three-layered network architecture. The proposed IEMN is characterized by its network architecture and application services. From the network architecture point of view;  the IEMN is characterized by the area control and management center;  the building control and management station;  and the BACnet facility. From the application service point of view;  the IEMN provides the intelligent energy service architecture to integrate the building management system functions and the facility management system. The IEMN offers several advantages such as the distributed intelligent management and the ability of data processing and analysis online. The hierarchical architecture makes it easy to integrate and to expand.<br><br>
