This paper presents a methodology for the optimal design of fixture layouts in multistation assembly processes. An optimal fixture layout improves the robustness of a fixture system against environmental noises;  reduces product variability;  and leads to manufacturing cost reduction. Three key aspects of the multistation fixture layout design are addressed: a multistation variation propagation model;  a quantitative measure of fixture design;  and an effective and efficient optimization algorithm. One of the challenges raised by this multistation design is that a high-dimension design space;  which usually embeds a lot of local optimums;  will have to be explored. Consequently;  it makes a global optimality more difficult and;  if an inefficient algorithm is used;  may require prohibitive computing time. In this paper;  exchange algorithms;  originally developed in the research of optimal experimental design;  are adopted and further revised to optimize fixture layouts in a multistation process. The revised exchange algorithm provides a good tradeoff between optimality and efficiency: it remarkably reduces the computing time without sacrificing the optimal value. A four-station assembly process for a sports utility vehicle sideframe is used throughout the paper to illustrate the relevant concepts and the resulting methodology.
