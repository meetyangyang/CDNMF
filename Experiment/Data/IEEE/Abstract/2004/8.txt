In this paper;  an overlapping decomposition method is used to estimate the throughput of a production system with multiple rework loops. The idea of the method is to decompose the system into a couple of serial lines and modify the parameters of overlapping machines to accommodate the effects of other lines. Using this method;  the throughput of an automotive paint shop is analyzed and continuous improvement procedures are described.<br><br>
