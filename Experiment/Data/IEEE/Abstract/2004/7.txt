We address the problem of scheduling robots' moves in a robotic cell that is used by a Dallas-area semiconductor equipment manufacturer. The cell has parallel machines;  multiple robots;  and Euclidean travel times. We describe a plan of operation that allows the robots to operate concurrently;  efficiently;  and with no risk of colliding. We propose a set of sequences of robot moves;  analytically determine this scheme's throughput;  and determine problem instances for which it is optimal. Through simulation;  we demonstrate that our scheme is superior to the heuristic dispatching rule currently in use by the manufacturer.<br><br>
