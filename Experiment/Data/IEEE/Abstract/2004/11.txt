Fixture design is an important manufacturing activity which affects the quality of parts produced. In order to develop a viable computer-aided fixturing tool;  the fixture-workpiece system has to be accurately modeled and analyzed. This paper describes the modeling;  analysis;  and verification of optimal fixturing configurations by the methods of force closure;  optimization;  and finite-element modeling (FEM). Force closure has been employed to find optimal clamping positions and sequencing;  while optimization is used for determining the minimum clamping forces required to balance the cutting forces. The developed FEM is able to determine in detail what are the reaction forces;  workpiece displacement;  deformation in the workpiece and fixtures. In order to produce a more accurate model for predicting the behavior of the fixture-workpiece system;  the developed FEM includes fixture stiffness;  which past models have assumed as rigid bodies. The reaction forces on the locators are experimentally verified. A sensor-embedded experimental fixturing setup was developed to verify the modeling and the data was used to compare with the FEM.
