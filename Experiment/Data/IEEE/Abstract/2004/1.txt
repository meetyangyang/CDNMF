A rapid prototyping (RP) machine system which combines a PC-based controller with the thermal-extrusion method is presented. The proposed RP system offers a three-axis platform;  an extrusion head;  a temperature controller;  and a PC-based control system. Low-cost acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) pellets/powder are used for thermal extrusion;  although the system is easily adapted to other not-too-dissimilar materials. In order to improve the quality of RP part;  the Taguchi method was used to analyzing the process parameters of the proposed RP system. Based on the experimental results;  the proposed RP mechatronics system can produce good quality RP parts. The RP software technique includes slicing;  support;  tool path;  and motion code generation. This paper also presents a new adaptive slicing algorithm for RP system. According to this algorithm;  the three-dimensional (3-D) computer-aided design (CAD) model can be sliced with different thickness automatically by comparing the contour circumference or the center of gravity of the contour with those of the adjacent layer. With this adaptive slicing method;  the part can be fabricated faster than it uses uniform slicing method with identical accuracy. Finally;  the intelligent web-based RP system allows remote users to upload an STL file;  to directly building up of the physical model;  and to monitor the actual fabrication process from a charged coupled devices (CCD) camera located in the RP machine itself. The user does not need to buy an expensive RP machine; instead;  he can rent time and uses the machine remotely via the Internet.
