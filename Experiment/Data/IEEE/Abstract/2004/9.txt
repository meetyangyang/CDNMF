Using parallelism in bufferless production lines can improve productivity;  with significant productivity gains achieved with crossover. However;  including crossover in the line implies additional material-handling requirements that may reduce the availability of the system. This paper examines if parallel systems with crossover between the stages are more productive than parallel systems without crossover between the stages;  when one considers the availability of the additional material handling required for the crossover. The minimum material-handling availability necessary for inclusion of crossover is determined for a given parallel line's configuration such that productivity can be maximized.<br><br>
