Variability reduction and business-process synchronization are acknowledged as keys to achieving sharp and timely deliveries in supply-chain networks. In this paper;  we introduce a new notion;  which we call six sigma supply chains to describe and quantify supply chains with sharp and timely deliveries;  and develop an innovative approach for designing such networks. The approach developed in this paper is founded on an intriguing connection between mechanical design tolerancing and supply-chain lead-time compression. We show that the design of six sigma supply chains can be formulated as a mathematical programming problem;  opening up a rich new framework for studying supply-chain design optimization problems. To show the efficacy of the notion and the design methodology;  we focus on a design optimization problem;  which we call the inventory optimization (IOPT) problem. Given a multistage supply-chain network;  the IOPT problem seeks to find optimal allocation of lead time variabilities and inventories to individual stages;  so as to achieve required levels of delivery performance in a cost-effective way. We formulate and solve the IOPT problem for a four-stage make-to-order liquid petroleum gas supply chain. The solution of the problem offers rich insights into inventory-service level tradeoffs in supply-chain networks and proves the potential of the new approach presented in this paper.<br><br>
