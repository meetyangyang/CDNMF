Root-cause identification for quality-related problems is a key issue in quality and productivity improvement for a manufacturing process. Unfortunately;  root-cause identification is also a very challenging engineering problem;  particularly for a multistage manufacturing process. In this paper;  root-cause identification is formulated as a problem of estimation and hypothesis testing of a general linear mixed model. First;  a linear mixed fault-quality model is built to describe the cause-effect relationship between the process faults and product quality. Then;  the estimation algorithms developed for a general linear mixed model are adapted to estimate the process mean and variance. Finally;  a hypothesis testing method is developed to determine if process faults exist in terms of statistical significance. A detailed experimental study illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.<br><br>
