The port yard storage optimization problem (PYSOP) originates from space allocation needs at the Port of Singapore. Space allocated to cargo is to be minimized in a designated yard within a time interval. The problem is akin to a packing problem in space and time;  but where shapes packed and constraints are particular to port operations. Further;  space requests can change within the time interval in which it is requested. This basic problem is generic to port operations and may find applications elsewhere. The PYSOP is NP-hard;  but we propose a number of metaheuristics. Extensive experiments were conducted and good results obtained.<br><br>
