In this paper;  we introduce unilateral fixtures ;  a new class of fixtures for sheet-metal parts with holes. These fixtures use cylindrical jaws with conical grooves that facilitate part alignment; each jaw provides the equivalent of four point contacts. The fixtures are unilateral in the sense that their actuating mechanisms are restricted to one side/surface of the part;  facilitating access to the other side/surface for assembly or inspection. We present a two-phase algorithm for computing unilateral fixtures. Phase I is a geometric algorithm that assumes the part is rigid and applies two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) kinematic analysis of form closure to identify all candidate locations for pairs of primary jaws. We prove three new grasp properties for 2-D and 3-D grips at concave vertices and define a scale-invariant quality metric based on the sensitivity of part orientation to infinitesimal relaxation of jaw position. Phase II uses a finite element method to compute part deformation and to arrange secondary contacts at part edges and interior surfaces. For a given sheet-metal part;  given as a 2-D surface embedded in 3-D with e edges;  n concavities and m mesh nodes;  Phase I takes O(e+n/sup 4/3/log/sup 1/3/n+glogg) time to compute a list of g pairs of primary jaws ranked by quality. Phase II computes the location of r secondary contacts in O(grm/sup 3/) time.
