This study focuses on the output feedback guaranteed cost control issue for networked control systems with random packet dropouts and time delays. The plant considered in this study is characterized by an uncertain linear discrete-time system;  wherein random packet dropouts and time delays exist in forward controller-to-actuator and feedback sensor-to-controller communication links that are modeled as unified multiple Markov chains. The resulting closed-loop system is modeled as a Markovian jump linear system. The guaranteed cost control issue is solved via Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality approach. The design of the mode-independent robust output feedback controller is derived under the Markov jump unified framework. The closed-loop system is not only stochastically stable but it also guarantees an adequate level of performance. A simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
