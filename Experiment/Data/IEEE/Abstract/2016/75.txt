This paper proposes a resource-oriented;  decentralized auction algorithm (RODAA) for multirobot task allocation considering multiple resources of the robots and limited robot communication range. The resources that this paper focuses on are the expendable supplies that a robot consumes and recharges while performing tasks;  such as energy. In the proposed algorithm;  each robot generates its cost for the task in a probabilistic manner considering multiple paths that visit none or different combinations of refill stations for performing the task based on the robot's residual resources. For robust and time-efficient task allocation with limited robot communication range in a dynamic network;  a multihop-based auction algorithm is proposed. This paper also introduces a solar panel cleaning mission as a new application for multirobot systems and the proposed algorithm is implemented in the simulation of the mission. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of completing the panel cleaning mission faster than other auction-based task allocation algorithms and has lower overall resource consumption.
