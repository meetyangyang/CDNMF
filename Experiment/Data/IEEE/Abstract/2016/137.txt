Queueing models can be used to evaluate the performance of manufacturing systems. Due to the emergence of cluster tools in contemporary production systems;  proper queueing models have to be derived to evaluate the performance of machines with complex configurations. Job cascading is a common structure among cluster tools. Because of the blocking and starvation effects among servers;  queue time analysis for a cluster tool with job cascading is difficult in general. Based on the insight from the reduction method;  we proposed the approximate model for the mean queue time of a cascading machine subject to breakdowns. The model is validated by simulation and performs well in the examined cases.
