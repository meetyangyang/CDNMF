The problem ofintercell scheduling considering transportation capacity with the objective of minimizing total weighted tardiness is addressed in this paper;  which in nature is the coordination of production and transportation. Since it is a practical decision-making problem with high complexity and large problem instances;  a hybrid evolutionary hyper-heuristic (HEH) approach;  which combines heuristic generation and heuristic selection;  is developed in this paper. In order to increase the diversity and effectiveness of heuristic rules;  genetic programming is used to automatically generate new rules based on the attributes of parts;  machines;  and vehicles. The new rules are added to the candidate rule set;  and a rule selection genetic algorithm is developed to choose appropriate rules for machines and vehicles. Finally;  scheduling solutions are obtained using the selected rules. A comparative evaluation is conducted;  with some state-of-the-art hyper-heuristic approaches which lack some of the strategies proposed in HEH;  with a meta-heuristic approach that is suitable for large scale scheduling problems;  and with adaptations of some well-known heuristic rules. Computational results show that the new rules generated in HEH have similarities to the best-performing human-made rules;  but are more effective due to the evolutionary processes in HEH. Moreover;  the HEH approach has advantages over other approaches in both computational efficiency and solution quality;  and is especially suitable for problems with large instance sizes.
