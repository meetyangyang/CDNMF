A contouring control method that integrates the equivalent errors and non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) interpolator is proposed in this study. The method of equivalent errors has been shown to possess many advantages for the contouring control of multi-axis motion systems. A key requirement of the method is that the desired path should be represented by algebraic path equations in generalized coordinates. On the other hand;  complicated curves are usually described by NURBS;  which is in a parametric form. To be integrated with the method of equivalent errors;  the parametric NURBS curve is transformed into a set of algebraic path equations by the Sylvester's implicitization method. As a result;  the proposed method is useful for the contouring control of multi-axis motion systems following free form complicated paths. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified experimentally through the application to a biaxial system following a star-like NURBS curve of degree 5.
