Serial lines and assembly systems are two of the most fundamental production system structures used in practical manufacturing environments. While serial lines have been studied extensively in production systems literature and practice;  assembly systems have received much less attention. Among existing results on assembly systems;  most are focused on steady state performance evaluation;  system properties;  and improvement. On the other hand;  transient behavior of such systems remains largely unexplored. In the framework of assembly systems with Bernoulli machines and finite buffers;  this paper develops a mathematical model for transient analysis and derives closed-form formulas to calculate the real-time production rate;  consumption rates;  work-in-process;  and probabilities of machine starvation and blockage;  during transients. Then;  an improved computationally efficient algorithm for transient performance evaluation in Bernoulli serial lines is proposed. Based on the improved algorithm;  an effective and efficient method for transient performance evaluation in Bernoulli assembly systems is derived. Finally;  the method is extended to complex assembly system structures.
