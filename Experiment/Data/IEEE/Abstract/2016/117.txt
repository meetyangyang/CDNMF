In this study;  we propose a hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm (HFOA) to solve the hybrid flowshop rescheduling problem with flexible processing time in steelmaking casting systems. First;  machine breakdown and processing variation disruptions are considered simultaneously in the rescheduling problem. Second;  each solution is represented by a fruit fly with a well-designed solution representation. Third;  two novel decoding heuristics considering the problem characteristics;  which can significantly improve the solution quality;  are developed. Several routing and scheduling neighborhood structures are proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. Finally;  we propose an effective HFOA with well-designed smell and vision search procedures. In addition;  an iterated greedy (IG) local search is embedded in the proposed algorithm to further enhance its exploitation ability. The proposed algorithm is tested on sets of instances generated from industrial data. Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analyses;  the performance of the proposed HFOA algorithm is favorably compared against several algorithms in terms of both solution quality and efficiency.
