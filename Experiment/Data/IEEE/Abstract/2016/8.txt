We consider hybrid systems with LTI continuous dynamics under collaborative control;  that is;  for which some events and inputs are controlled solely by a human operator and other events and inputs are controlled by the automation. The user-interface is a device through which the output of the system can be observed;  and inputs from the human can be initiated. We model the user as an observer with additional requirements beyond a standard (automated) observer. We state conditions for user-observability and user-predictability to evaluate whether a given user-interface provides the user with adequate information to complete a desired task. We apply these conditions to two examples in aircraft flight management systems.
