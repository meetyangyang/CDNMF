Piezo-actuated stages have become more and more promising in nanopositioning applications due to the excellent advantages of the fast response time;  large mechanical force;  and extremely fine resolution. Modeling and control are critical to achieve objectives for high-precision motion. However;  piezo-actuated stages themselves suffer from the inherent drawbacks produced by the inherent creep and hysteresis nonlinearities and vibration caused by the lightly damped resonant dynamics;  which make modeling and control of such systems challenging. To address these challenges;  various techniques have been reported in the literature. This paper surveys and discusses the progresses of different modeling and control approaches for piezo-actuated nanopositioning stages and highlights new opportunities for the extended studies.
