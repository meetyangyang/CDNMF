This research proposes a centralized method for planning and monitoring the motion of one or a few mobile robots in an environment where regions of interest appear and disappear based on exponential probability density functions. The motion task is given as a linear temporal logic formula over the set of regions of interest. The solution determines robotic trajectories and updates them whenever necessary;  such that the task is most likely to be satisfied with respect to probabilistic information on regions. The robots' movement capabilities are abstracted to finite state descriptions;  and operations as product automata and graph searches are used in the provided solution. The approach builds up on temporal logic control strategies for static environments by incorporating probabilistic information and by designing an execution monitoring strategy that reacts to actual region observations yielded by robots. Several simulations are included;  and a software implementation of the solution is available. The computational complexity of our approach increases exponentially when more robots are considered;  and we mention a possible solution to reduce the computational complexity by fusing regions with identical observations.
