In this paper;  an adaptive fast terminal sliding mode control control law (AFTSMCL) is presented to resolve attitude tracking control problem for rigid spacecraft;  which can provide finite-time convergence;  strong robustness;  and fault-tolerant control. Rigorous proof is achieved first. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of presented control law.
