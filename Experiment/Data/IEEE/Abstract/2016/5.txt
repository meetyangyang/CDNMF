In this paper;  we consider the problem of designing in-vehicle driver-assist systems that warn or override the driver to prevent collisions with a guaranteed probability. The probabilistic nature of the problem naturally arises from many sources of uncertainty;  among which the behavior of the surrounding vehicles and the response of the driver to on-board warnings. We formulate this problem as a control problem for uncertain systems under probabilistic safety specifications and leverage the structure of the application domain to reach computationally efficient implementations. Simulations using a naturalistic data set show that the empirical probability of safety is always within 5% of the theoretical value in the case of direct driver override. In the case of on-board warnings;  the empirical value is more conservative due primarily to drivers decelerating more strongly than requested. However;  the empirical value is greater than or equal to the theoretical value;  demonstrating a clear safety benefit.
