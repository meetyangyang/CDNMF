In this paper;  the model repair of timed discrete-event systems where anomalies may occur is considered. The nominal model is assumed to be known;  and a set of observed timed sequences is given. The approach works with time Petri net models and is based on the formulation of a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The repaired model is obtained from the nominal one by adding fault transitions as well as by extending the firing interval of transitions.
