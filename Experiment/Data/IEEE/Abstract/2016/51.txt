In this paper;  we propose to use the multiple ultrasonic attenuation profiles measured at different locations of a specimen to infer the microstructure of metal-matrix nanocomposites. We present a general framework to connect the profile data with both explanatory variables and product quality parameters for quality inference. In particular;  a hierarchical linear model with level-2 variance heterogeneity is proposed to model the relationship between ultrasonic attenuation profiles;  ultrasonic frequency;  and the microstructural parameters of the nanocomposites. An integrated Bayesian framework for model estimation;  model selection;  and inference of the microstructural parameters is proposed through blocked Gibbs sampling;  intrinsic Bayes factor;  and importance sampling. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through case studies.
