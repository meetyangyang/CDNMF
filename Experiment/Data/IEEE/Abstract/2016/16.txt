The block relocation problem;  which is also known as the container relocation problem;  is an optimization problem to find an optimal sequence of operations for retrieving blocks (containers) from a container yard in a given order. The objective function to be minimized is the number of necessary relocations. In this study;  we propose an efficient exact algorithm for two variants of the block relocation problem;  those with distinct and duplicate retrieval priorities. In the former problem;  the retrieval order of blocks is uniquely provided;  whereas in the latter problem;  it is given only among groups of blocks. The primary contribution of this study is a tighter lower bound of the number of relocations than existing ones. This enables us to construct a faster branch-and-bound algorithm. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments.
