Feature-based technologies are widely researched for manufacturing automation. However;  in current feature models;  features once defined remain constant throughout the whole manufacturing lifecycle. This static feature model is inflexible to support adaptive machining when facing frequent changes to manufacturing resources. This paper presents a new machining feature concept that facilitates responsive changes to the dynamics of machining features in 2.5/3D machining. Basic geometry information for feature construction of complex parts with various intersecting features is represented as a set of meta machining features (MMF). Optimum feature definition is generated adaptively by choosing optimum merging strategies of MMFs according to the capabilities of the selected machine tool;  cutter;  and cutting parameters. A composite function block for dynamic machining feature modelling is designed with Basic Machining Feature Function Block;  Meta Machining Feature Extraction Function Block and Feature Interpreter Function Block. Once changes of the selected machining resources occur;  they are informed as input events and machining features are then updated automatically and adaptively based on the event-driven model of function blocks. An example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the developed methodology.
