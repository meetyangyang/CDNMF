Cooperative localization has been proved to effectively outperform single-robot localization. While most of the state-of-the-art multi-robot localization systems either treat moving objects as outliers or accomplish moving object tracking separately from localization;  we argue that augmenting moving objects into the localization estimation can further enhance localization performance and is indeed the key to solve several localization challenges such as insufficient map features;  no map features;  and symmetric maps. In this paper;  a multi-robot simultaneous localization and tracking (MR-SLAT) algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter is proposed;  and multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) is integrated into MR-SLAT for dealing with challenging data association issues. The proposed approach is verified in two scenarios: the NAO humanoid robots equipped with cameras and WiFi are used in the RoboCup scenario and the robotic vehicles with laser scanners and dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) are used in the traffic scenario. The experiments with ground truth show that MR-SLAT;  by exploiting moving objects;  is superior to single-robot localization and cooperative localization in challenging scenarios. Ample experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting moving objects and the generality and feasibility of the proposed MR-SLAT algorithm.
