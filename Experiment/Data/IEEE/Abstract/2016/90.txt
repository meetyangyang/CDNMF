To deal with uncertainties in energy optimization of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs);  this paper presents a robust total energy optimization problem with productive and idle powers of resources being random variables (RVs). Using the weighted p-timed Petri net model of FMS;  the robust energy-optimal schedule is determined by searching the robust shortest path of reachability graph based on Renyi mean-entropy criterion. The Renyi quadratic entropy is proposed as a robustness measure which does not depend on the Gaussianity of RVs and can be computed easily from samples. Next;  Bellman's dynamic programming is applied to find the shortest path in Renyi mean-entropy criterion. The effectiveness of Renyi mean-entropy criterion is verified with mathematical rigour as well as extensive numerical results from simulations and an industrial stamping system;  in terms of computational complexity and deviation from optimality.
