We propose a synthesis method of switching control policies for a class of shared autonomy systems in which control authority is held by either a human operator or an autonomous controller based on the state of the overall system. The objective is to optimize the system performance measured by the probability of satisfying a system specification in linear temporal logic;  while ensuring a reasonable workload for the human operator. The synthesis method builds upon the construction of an abstract model for the given shared autonomy system from a set of components modeled by Markov decision processes;  which are capable of capturing the uncertainty in the operator's performance and response to switching control signals under his different cognitive and physiological states. A cost function is then introduced to quantify the human operator's workload. In order to establish quantitative trade-offs between the operator's effort and the system performance;  we propose a two-stage policy synthesis algorithm for generating Pareto-optimal switching control policies.
