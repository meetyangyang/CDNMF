This work integrates a physics-based model with a data driven time-series model to forecast and optimally manage building energy. Physical characterization of the building is partially captured by a collection of zonal energy balance equations with parameters estimated using a least squares estimation (LSE) technique and data initially generated from the EnergyPlus building model. A generalized Cochran-Orcutt estimation technique is adopted to describe the data generated from these simulations. The combined forecast model is then used in a model predictive control (MPC) framework to manage heating and cooling set points. This work is motivated by the practical limitations of simulation-based optimizations. Once the forecast model is established capturing sufficient statistical variability and physical behavior of the building;  there will be no more need to run EnergyPlus in the optimization routine. The proposed methodology lends itself for real-life implementation of building energy management systems where predictive control is desired to reduce energy use and avoid demand charges and occupant discomfort. At each time step;  it determines the optimal set point values of all building's zones and updates these values over time. In practice;  the proposed control strategy can be implemented in commercial smart energy boxes to optimally control total daily energy-use costs.
