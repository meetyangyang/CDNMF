This paper presents an urban-decision support system (U-DSS) devoted to manage;  in a unified framework;  the logistic services of the smart cities;  such as postal delivery (PD) and waste collection (WC) services. The U-DSS architecture is proposed by describing its main components. In particular;  this paper focuses on the core of the U-DSS;  i.e.;  the model component that provides the solutions of a general vehicle assignment and routing optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the length of the routes and satisfying time and capacity constraints. In order to solve the vehicle routing problems in reasonable time;  a two-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed based on a clustering strategy and a farthest insertion heuristic for the solution of a traveling salesman problem. The applicability of the proposed U-DSS is enlightened by comparing the proposed heuristic algorithm solutions with the mixed integer linear programming problem solutions of the PD and WC services. Moreover;  the discussion of the real case studies of the city of Bari (Italy) assesses the proposed approach.
