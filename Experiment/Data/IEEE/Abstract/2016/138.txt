Wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) are often used for maintenance of round pipes or ducts;  which can typically be represented as a cylindrical workspace. Working in round pipes or ducts;  kinematic models of WMRs are different from those applying on a plane and thus pose significant challenges in terms of kinematic analysis and motion control. To address these challenges;  the kinematic properties of WMRs in a cylindrical workspace are analyzed in this paper. First;  we discuss the kinematic properties of a single wheel in a cylindrical workspace. Then;  we analyze the geometric constraints of WMRs in round pipes or ducts with analytical geometry. Based on these analyses;  kinematic properties of WMRs in cylindrical workspaces are discussed with screw theory. A control law based on biaxial clinometer information is proposed;  and it enables the robot to move horizontally in round pipes or ducts. Finally;  the motion of a single wheel purely rolling in a cylindrical workspace is simulated. Experiments using a car-like mobile robot moving in round ducts are carried out to show the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.
