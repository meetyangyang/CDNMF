An experimental design utilizing artificial neural networks (ANNs);  the Taguchi method;  and the genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to obtain optimal processing parameters for cathode arc plasma deposition of ZnO thin films on a glass substrate. The Taguchi method's orthogonal array is used to minimize the number of required experiments and to gather the experimental data. An ANN is then used to construct a system model based on the experimental data. Finally;  the GA is used to determine the optimal process parameters. The average resistivity obtained from the optimal processing parameters is 3.19 × 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>-3</sup>\n Q-cm and the average transmittance obtained is 86.04%;  both of which improve on results obtained using the Taguchi method alone (3.69 × 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>-3</sup>\n Q-cm and 85.41%). This indicates that the proposed design is a viable approach for determining the optimal process parameters.
