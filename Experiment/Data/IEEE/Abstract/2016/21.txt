Sampling-based algorithms for path planning;  such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT);  have achieved great success;  thanks to their ability to efficiently solve complex high-dimensional problems. However;  standard versions of these algorithms cannot guarantee optimality or even high-quality for the produced paths. In recent years;  variants of these methods;  such as T-RRT;  have been proposed to deal with cost spaces: by taking configuration-cost functions into account during the exploration process;  they can produce high-quality (i.e.;  low-cost) paths. Other novel variants;  such as RRT*;  can deal with optimal path planning: they ensure convergence toward the optimal path;  with respect to a given path-quality criterion. In this paper;  we propose to solve a complex problem encompassing this two paradigms: optimal path planning in a cost space. For that;  we develop two efficient sampling-based approaches that combine the underlying principles of RRT* and T-RRT. These algorithms;  called T-RRT* and AT-RRT;  offer the same asymptotic optimality guarantees as RRT*. Results presented on several classes of problems show that they converge faster than RRT* toward the optimal path;  especially when the topology of the search space is complex and/or when its dimensionality is high.
