This paper deals with the novel and complex problem of scheduling the internal operations in post-distribution cross docking systems (PDCDSs);  i.e.;  a kind of cross docking terminal where the operations of good allocation are performed. More precisely;  internal operations of the PDCDS consist in deconsolidating inbound cases;  sorting products according to customer requests;  and consolidating outbound cases. The problem is determining the optimal schedule of the internal operations with the objective of minimizing the makespan. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First;  the PDCDS scheduling problem is characterized and the corresponding NP-hardness is proved. Second;  in order to address the complexity of the problem;  two mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models and a heuristic algorithm are presented. In particular;  the mathematical programming formulations are solved by using symmetry breaking constraints and objective function perturbations. Moreover;  the lower bounds of the start times of operations are evaluated in order to strengthen the formulations. A set of test results compare the formulation performances and a case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic algorithm to schedule the operations of an half work day of an Italian company of cloth retail stores.
