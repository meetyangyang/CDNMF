Wireless sensor network has emerged as a key technology for monitoring space-time dynamics of complex systems;  e.g.;  environmental sensor network;  battlefield surveillance network;  and body area sensor network. However;  sensor failures are not uncommon in traditional sensing systems. As such;  we propose the design of stochastic sensor networks to allow a subset of sensors at varying locations within the network to transmit dynamic information intermittently. Realizing the full potential of stochastic sensor network hinges on the development of novel information-processing algorithms to support the design and exploit the uncertain information for decision making. This paper presents a new approach of sparse particle filtering to model spatiotemporal dynamics of big data in the stochastic sensor network. Notably;  we developed a sparse kernel-weighted regression model to achieve a parsimonious representation of spatial patterns. Further;  the parameters of spatial model are transformed into a reduced-dimension space;  and thereby sequentially updated with the recursive Bayesian estimation when new sensor observations are available over time. Therefore;  spatial and temporal processes closely interact with each other. Experimental results on real-world data and different scenarios of stochastic sensor networks (i.e.;  spatially;  temporally;  and spatiotemporally dynamic networks) demonstrated the effectiveness of sparse particle filtering to support the stochastic design and harness the uncertain information for modeling space-time dynamics of complex systems.
