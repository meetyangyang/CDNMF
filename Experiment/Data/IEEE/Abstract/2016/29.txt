On the hospital floor;  prompt detection and appropriate treatment of clinical deterioration of ward patients are essential for successful rescue. In this paper;  a continuous time Markov chain model is presented to describe the ward patient status and analyze the patient rescue processes;  which are characterized by the transitions between different patient states;  such as risk;  non-risk;  intervention by care providers (nurse;  physician;  rapid response team);  or elevation to intensive care;  etc. Closed formulas to calculate the probability of the patient in different states are developed for single patient case. A system-theoretic method;  referred to as shared resource iteration (SRI);  is developed to study the multiple patients scenario. It is justified that such an iterative method is convergent and results in a high accuracy in estimation of patient state probabilities through numerical experiments. Moreover;  monotonic properties have been investigated to provide guidance for continuous improvement.
