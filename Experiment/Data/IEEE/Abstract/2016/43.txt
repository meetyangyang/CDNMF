An important challenge to be addressed in the domain of Internet of Things (IoT) is the development of efficient services selection algorithms for an optimal management of both energy and Quality of Service (QoS) in the context of IoT services composition. This issue becomes crucial in the case of large-scale IoT environments composed of thousands of distributed entities. In this paper;  an energy-centered and QoS-aware services selection algorithm (EQSA) is proposed for IoT services composition. The proposed selection approach consists of preselecting the services offering the QoS level required for user's satisfaction using a lexicographic optimization strategy and QoS constraints relaxation technique. In order to reduce the energy consumption of a composite service without affecting the user's satisfaction;  the most suitable services among the preselected ones are then selected using the concept of relative dominance of services in the sense of Pareto. The relative dominance of a candidate service depends on its energy profile and QoS attributes;  and user's preferences. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated through several simulation scenarios. The obtained results show clearly the good performances of the EQSA algorithm in terms of selection time;  energy efficiency;  composition lifetime;  and optimality and its added value in comparison with algorithms dealing separately with QoS and energy consumption.
