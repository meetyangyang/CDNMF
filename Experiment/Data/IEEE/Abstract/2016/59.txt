Consolidation lies at the heart of the last-mile logistics problem. Urban consolidation centers (UCCs) have been set up to facilitate such consolidation all over the world. To the best of our knowledge;  most-if not all-of the UCCs operate on volume-based fixed-rate charges. To achieve environmental sustainability while ensuring economic sustainability in urban logistics;  we propose;  in this paper;  a bicriteria auction mechanism for the automated assignment of last-mile delivery orders to transport resources. We formulate and solve the winner determination problem of the auction as a biobjective programming model. We then present a systematic way to generate the Pareto frontier to characterize the tradeoff between achieving economic and environmental sustainabilities in urban logistics. Finally;  we demonstrate that our proposed bicriteria auction produces the solutions that significantly dominate those obtained from the fixed-rate mechanisms. Our sensitivity analysis on the willingness of carriers to participate in the UCC operation reveals that higher willingness is favorable toward achieving greater good for all;  if UCC is designed to be nonprofit and self-sustaining.
