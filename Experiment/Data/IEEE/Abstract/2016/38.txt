In this paper;  we propose a coordinated localization algorithm for mobile sensor networks with camera sensors to operate under Global Positioning System (GPS) denied areas or indoor environments. Mobile robots are partitioned into two groups. One group moves within the field of views of remaining stationary robots. The moving robots are tracked by stationary robots and their trajectories are used as spatiotemporal features. From these spatiotemporal features;  relative poses of robots are computed using multiview geometry and a group of robots is localized with respect to the reference coordinate based on the proposed multirobot localization. Once poses of all robots are recovered;  a group of robots moves from one location to another while maintaining the formation of robots for coordinated localization under the proposed multirobot navigation strategy. By taking the advantage of a multiagent system;  we can reliably localize robots over time as they perform a group task. In experiment;  we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves a localization error rate of 0.37% or less for trajectories of length between 715 cm and 890 cm using an inexpensive off-the-shelf robotic platform.
