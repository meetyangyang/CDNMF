In this paper;  we present an algorithm for decentralized control of multiple automated guided vehicles performing transportation tasks within industrial and warehousing environments. By running on each vehicle in the system;  the algorithm provides vehicles with capabilities for autonomous path planning and motion co-ordination. The path planning part of the algorithm implements a free-ranging motion scheme by determining the shortest feasible paths considering nonholonomic vehicle constraints. The motion co-ordination part of the algorithm ensures safe vehicle motions by reliable detection and resolution of different conflict situations with other vehicles in the shared workspace. Conflict resolution is based on a vehicle priority scheme and results in temporary stopping or removal of the lower priority vehicles taking part in the conflict. Removal action is always performed within the vehicle's private zone;  i.e.;  the pre-allocated local region of the workspace surrounding the vehicle. By encoding information on the vehicle size and its kinematic constraints;  the introduced private zone mechanism provides the necessary physical space required for successful execution of every removal action. We also analyze the stability of the presented algorithm and discuss its deadlock-free and livelock-free properties. Algorithm performance has been validated by simulation using ten vehicles and experimentally on two different setups-a laboratory setup comprising five Pioneer 3DX vehicles and by two state-of-the-art autonomous forklifts in industrial-like operating conditions.
