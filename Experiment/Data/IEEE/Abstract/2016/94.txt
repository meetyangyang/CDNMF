Neck pain is common among occupations requiring static neck flexion. Therefore;  this project develops and tests a neck support to alleviate occupational neck pain. The design supports workers' heads during neck flexion to reduce neck muscle activity. Surface electromyography tests and workplace tests using a prototype yielded promising efficacy results. We designed and tested a new;  wearable device to support workers' heads during neck flexion. The device acts as a headrest to reduce neck pain in people like dentists who hold their heads bent forward. Lab test results showed a reduction in muscle loads while workplace testing validated market potential.
