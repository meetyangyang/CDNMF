In this paper;  we consider a joint pricing and dynamic production policy for perishable items without shortages. A unimodal time-varying demand function is assumed to be convex nonincreasing in sales price. We propose a dynamic optimization model to maximize total profit by allocating a limited production capacity and setting a suitable sales price. For a given sales price;  the optimal production rate can be obtained by solving a dynamic optimization problem with Pontryagin's maximum principle. By virtue of the relationships between price intervals and the corresponding optimal production policies;  an effective algorithm is designed to generate the joint policy for a system with a general nonlinear demand function of price. For a linear demand function;  it is shown that the objective function is concave in price and that there exists a unique optimal joint policy. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the theoretical results;  and several managerial implications in terms of the production and pricing of perishable items are provided.
