DTLS is becoming the de facto standard for communication security in the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to run the DTLS protocol;  one needs to establish keys between the communicating devices. The default method of key establishment requires X.509 certificates and a Public Key Infrastructure;  an approach which is often too resource consuming for small IoT devices. DTLS also supports the use of preshared keys and raw public keys. These modes are more lightweight;  but they are not scalable to a large number of devices.
