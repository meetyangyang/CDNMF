We propose an approach to synthesize control protocols for autonomous systems that account for uncertainties and imperfections in interactions with human operators. As an illustrative example;  we consider a scenario involving road network surveillance by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is controlled remotely by a human operator but also has a certain degree of autonomy. Depending on the type (i.e.;  probabilistic and/or nondeterministic) of knowledge about the uncertainties and imperfections in the human-automation interactions;  we use abstractions based on Markov decision processes and augment these models to stochastic two-player games. Our approach enables the synthesis of operator-dependent optimal mission plans for the UAV;  highlighting the effects of operator characteristics (e.g.;  workload;  proficiency;  and fatigue) on UAV mission performance. It can also provide informative feedback (e.g.;  Pareto curves showing the tradeoffs between multiple mission objectives);  potentially assisting the operator in decision-making. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a detailed UAV mission planning case study.
