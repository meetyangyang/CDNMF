The industrial sector is one of the largest energy consumers in the world. To alleviate the grid's burden during peak hours;  time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing has been implemented in many countries around the globe to encourage manufacturers to shift their electricity usage from peak periods to off-peak periods. In this paper;  we study the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem under a TOU pricing scheme. The objective is to minimize the total electricity cost by appropriately scheduling the jobs such that the overall completion time does not exceed a predetermined production deadline. To solve this problem;  two solution approaches are presented. The first approach models the problem with a new time-interval-based mixed integer linear programming formulation. In the second approach;  we reformulate the problem using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and propose a column generation heuristic to solve it. Computational experiments are conducted under different TOU settings and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Based on the numerical results;  we provide some practical suggestions for decision makers to help them in achieving a good balance between the productivity objective and the energy cost objective.
