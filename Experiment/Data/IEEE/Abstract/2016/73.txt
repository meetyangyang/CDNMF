For a large-scale distributed system;  distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is a method of choice because of its ability to explicitly accommodate constraints and to achieve good dynamic performance. In the design of a DMPC;  guaranteeing stability with a strong global performance is known to be a challenge. In this paper;  we consider a large-scale distributed system whose input is constrained to given sets in their respective spaces and propose a stabilizing DMPC design;  where each subsystem-based model predictive control (MPC) optimizes the cost function of the entire system over the region it directly impacts on. Consistency constraints and stability constraints;  which bound the estimation errors of the interaction sequences among subsystems;  are designed to guarantee that;  if an initially feasible solution can be found;  subsequent feasibility of the algorithm is guaranteed at every update;  and that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. A key feature of the proposed DMPC is that it coordinates the MPCs of the subsystems by redefining the impact region of a subsystem according to the coordination strategy. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed DMPC is very close to that of a centralized MPC.
