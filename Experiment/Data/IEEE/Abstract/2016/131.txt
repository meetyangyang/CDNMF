Projection to latent structures (PLS) and concurrent PLS are approaches for solving quality-relevant process monitoring. In this paper;  a new approach called concurrent kernel PLS (CKPLS) is presented to detect faults comprehensively for nonlinear processes. The new model divides the nonlinear process and quality spaces into five subspaces: the co-varying;  process-principal;  process-residual;  quality-principal;  and quality-residual subspaces. The co-varying subspace reflects nonlinear relationship between quality variables and original process variables. The process-principal and process-residual subspaces reflect the principal variations and residuals;  respectively;  in the nonlinear process space. Further;  the quality-principal and quality-residual subspaces reflect the principal variations and residuals;  respectively;  in the quality space. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical simulation and an application of the Tennessee Eastman process.
