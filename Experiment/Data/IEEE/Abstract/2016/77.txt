In this study;  a predictive-p control system is developed for the level process in an industrial coke fractionation tower. Such processes typically have integrating and nonlinear dynamics causing the performance of conventional control designs and tuning to be poor or to require significant effort in practice. The process model is derived using data of step-response test and control implementation is designed through a new state-space structure. The closed-loop control system contains both the improved predictive control and P control. The performance of the proposed control for regulatory/servo;  disturbance rejection;  and measurement noise problems are studied and the obtained results show that the control system is of simple implementation with more robustness and provides better responses than conventional predictive control.
