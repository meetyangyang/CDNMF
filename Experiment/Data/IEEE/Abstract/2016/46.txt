Location service is one of the primary services in smart automated systems of Internet of Things (IoT). For various location-based services;  accurate localization has become a key issue. Recently;  research on IoT localization systems for smart buildings has been attracting increasing attention. In this paper;  we propose a novel localization approach that utilizes the neighbor relative received signal strength to build the fingerprint database and adopts a Markov-chain prediction model to assist positioning. The approach is called the novel localization method (LNM) in short. In the proposed LNM scheme;  the history data of the pedestrian's locations are analyzed to further lower the unpredictable signal fluctuations in a smart building environment;  meanwhile enabling calibration-free positioning for various devices. The performance evaluation conducted in a realistic environment shows that the presented method demonstrates superior localization performance compared with well-known existing schemes;  especially when the problems of device heterogeneity and WiFi signals fluctuation exist.
