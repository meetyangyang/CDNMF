Production Lead Time \\mbi (LT) is the average time a part spends in the system;  being processed or waiting for processing. In systems with unlimited buffers;  \\mbi LT may be orders of magnitude larger than the total processing time;  leading to serious economic and quality problems. At present;  no systematic analytical methods for evaluation;  analysis;  and control of \\mbi LT in systems with machines having up- and downtime characterized by continuous random variables are available. This paper is intended to develop such methods. Specifically;  we address synchronous serial lines with exponential machines and derive formulas for \\mbi LT as a function of machine parameters and raw material release rate. Using these formulas;  we develop methods for open- and closed-loop raw material release;  which result in the desired \\mbi LT. For asynchronous exponential lines;  we provide an upper bound on LT. For non-exponential lines (e.g.;  Weibull;  gamma;  and log-normal);  we offer an empirical formula for \\mbi LT as an affine function of the coefficient of variation. The results reported in this paper enable a new paradigm for production systems management;  namely: manage a production system so that the desired \\mbi LT is ensured;  while the throughput is maximized. This paper analyzes production lead time in manufacturing systems with hardware-unlimited buffers. The main practical insights obtained are as follows. . The lead time as a function of the raw material release rate has a “knee-type” behavior. . Releasing raw material beyond the knee results in no noticeable increase of the throughput;  but in unlimited increase of the lead time. . To maintain the lead time close to the knee (and;  thus;  maximize the throughput);  a simple control law may be used: release raw material on;  say;  hourly or shift-type basis;  if the total work-in-process is below a certain threshold (provided in the paper) and do not release otherwise.
