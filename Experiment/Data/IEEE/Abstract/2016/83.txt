In this paper;  an adaptive iterative learning control (AILC) strategy for high-speed trains with unknown speed delays and control input saturations is designed to address speed trajectory tracking problem. The train motion dynamics containing nonlinearities and parametric uncertainties are formulated as a nonlinearly parameterized system. Instead of estimation or modeling of train delays;  an unknown time-varying delay term is integrated into the speed on delay analysis by means of Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Through rigorous analysis;  it is confirmed that the proposed AILC mechanism can guarantee L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>[0;  T]</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n convergence of train speed to the desired profile during operations repeatedly. Case studies with numerical simulations further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
