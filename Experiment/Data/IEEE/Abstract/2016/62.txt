This paper proposes a Petri net (PN) representation of the activities performed by the key human operators for unloading/loading containers in an intermodal maritime container terminal (CT) with a low level of automation. These processes are the core of the export;  import;  and transshipment cycles executed in the terminal. The aim of this paper is to consider both the human component and the material handling resources;  e.g.;  cranes and transporters;  by defining an accurate model;  which describes how to coordinate humans and use the system resources necessary for serving mother or feeder ships. The developed generalized stochastic PN-based model is of limited complexity and represents a complete;  unambiguous;  and readable model of the target process before coding it in the target simulation tool. The modular integrated model is tested and validated by the simulation of typical and perturbed scenarios of the Taranto CT;  a real terminal that is taken as a case study for its complexity and similarity to CTs with multiple transport modes.
