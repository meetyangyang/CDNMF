Currently;  most web service recommendation studies concentrate on mining association patterns among services from historical compositions and recommending proper services based on patterns derived. However;  latent negative patterns which indicate the inappropriate combinations of services;  are mostly ignored. Therefore;  by combining additional negative patterns with the already-exploited positive patterns in the large spares network of web services;  we present a more comprehensive and accurate model for service recommendation. More specifically;  we combine positive and negative composition patterns mined from service annotated tags. The extensive experiments conducted on a real-life dataset show that our method can outperform not only traditional APriori -based recommendation method but also Link Prediction-based one. The experiments on a synthetic dataset show that our method can also be effective to make recommendations in large-scale service network.
