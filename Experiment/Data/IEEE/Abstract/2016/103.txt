Solder ball height and substrate coplanarity inspection is essential to the detection of potential connectivity issues in semi-conductor units. Current ball height and substrate coplanarity inspection tools such as laser profiling;  fringe projection;  and confocal microscopy are expensive;  require complicated setup and are slow;  which makes them difficult to use in a real-time manufacturing setting. Therefore;  a reliable;  in-line ball height and substrate coplanarity measurement method is needed for inspecting units undergoing assembly.
