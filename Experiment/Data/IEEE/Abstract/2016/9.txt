The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors;  actuators;  Smartphone;  appliances;  etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided;  all the time and everywhere;  to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality;  is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper;  we propose a new service-oriented;  user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes;  and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition;  the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.
