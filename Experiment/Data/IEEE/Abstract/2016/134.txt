Cluster tools have been extensively used for many semiconductor manufacturing processes such as lithograph;  etching;  deposition;  and testing. Most previous studies on cluster tool scheduling have focused on steady cycles in which cluster tools repeat identical work cycles. However;  the proportion of noncyclic transient operation cycles such as start-up cycles and close-down cycles becomes larger as the lot size tends to be smaller. We examine optimal transient scheduling for a single-armed cluster tool;  in which there are parallel chambers and a process chamber is a bottleneck;  while minimizing the makespan of a lot. To do this;  we first identify fundamental properties of noncyclic transient cycles in a tool by analyzing resource workloads. We then propose a simple robot task sequence;  a generalized backward sequence;  which performs backward operations incrementally for start-up cycles and decrementally for close-down cycles. We also develop workload-based conditions for which the generalized backward sequence has the minimum makespan for single-armed cluster tools with parallel chambers. Finally;  we develop a linear programming model to find the minimum makespan of the generalized backward sequence for the cases in which the conditions are not met and show its effectiveness.
