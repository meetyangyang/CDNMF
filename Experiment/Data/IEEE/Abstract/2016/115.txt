A carbon nanotube (CNT) film;  which is drawn from a CNT array;  is a spatially distributed thin film with unique and appealing properties. Novel devices have been developed based on CNT films. The anisotropy of a CNT film;  which is a spatially distributed quality index;  is difficult to measure in practice due to metrology and cost constraints. As the anisotropy is highly correlated with the height of the CNT array and the height can be measured in a much easier and more cost-effective way;  we propose a spatial model for predicting the anisotropy using the height. The model takes the spatially distributed two-dimensional (2-D) height as an input and provides a predicted anisotropy distribution in a 2-D space. If the anisotropy measures are obtained;  the model can provide a more accurate prediction. The performance of the proposed model is verified by both a simulation study and real data samples.
