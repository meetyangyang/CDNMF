This paper describes hybrid model predictive controllers that switch between two predictor functions based on the uncontrollable divergence metric. The uncontrollable divergence metric relates the computational capabilities of the model predictive controller;  to the error of the system due to model mismatch of the predictor function during computation of the solution. The contribution of this paper is in its treatment of the model predictive controller to permit optimization to take multiple timesteps to occur;  but still rely on the uncontrollable divergence metric. The results demonstrate the approach for control of a vertical takeoff-and-landing aerial vehicle.
