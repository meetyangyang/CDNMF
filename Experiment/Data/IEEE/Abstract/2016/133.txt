Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are computers that are hardened for industrial environments and have I/O that are used to monitor and control a physical process. Learning automata specifications from PLCs provides an interface to verification tools that use an automata language;  such as Uppaal. This paper introduces the time delay Mealy machine and demonstrates that it is sufficiently expressive to model PLC software. Using the LearnLib library;  we implement a custom learning method to learn models from several industrial examples and analyze the efficiency. We show that the method is able to learn from simple PLC software;  but the time required to learn increases rapidly with the scale of the software.
