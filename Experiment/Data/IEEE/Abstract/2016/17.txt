In this paper;  a predicate transition model for discrete-event systems is generalized to include continuous dynamics;  and the result is a modular hybrid predicate transition model. Based on this model;  a hybrid Petri net including explicit differential equations and shared variables is also proposed. It is then shown how this hybrid Petri net model can be optimized based on a simple and robust nonlinear programming formulation. The procedure only assumes that desired sampled paths for a number of interacting moving devices are given;  while originally equidistant time instances are adjusted to minimize a given criterion. This optimization of hybrid systems is also applied to a real robot station with interacting devices;  which results in about 30% reduction in energy consumption. Moreover;  a flexible online and event-based information architecture called the Tweeting Factory is proposed. Simple messages (tweets) from all kinds of equipment are combined into high-level knowledge;  and it is demonstrated how this information architecture can be used to support optimization of robot stations.
