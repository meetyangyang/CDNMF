This paper is concerned with the problem of adaptive tracking control for a class of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty;  bounded external disturbance;  and actuator saturation. In order to achieve robust output tracking for the saturated uncertain nonlinear systems;  a combination of adaptive robust control (ARC) and a novel terminal sliding-mode-based nonlinear disturbance observer (TSDO) is proposed;  where the modeling inaccuracy and disturbance are integrated as a lumped disturbance. Specifically;  the observer errors of estimating the lump disturbances converge to zero in finite-time for improving the precision of estimation. The estimated disturbances are then used in the controller to compensate for the system's lumped disturbances. The analytical results show that the proposed scheme is stable and can guarantee the asymptotic tracking with the tracking error converging to zero even in the presence of disturbances. Finally;  the developed method is illustrated the effectiveness by the application to control of a quarter-car model with active suspension system.
