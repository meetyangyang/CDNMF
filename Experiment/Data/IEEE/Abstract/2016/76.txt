This paper presents a bio-inspired caterpillar-like climbing method. Natural caterpillars climb relatively slow;  but their multisegmented body trunk strongly enhances climbing versatility and stability;  which thus motivates us to design an imitative robot to study the caterpillar-like climbing locomotion. Based on observations from natural caterpillars;  we propose a three-stage climbing method to imitate the caterpillar-like straight line climbing on a planar wall. Due to the redundancy property of caterpillars' multisegmented body trunk;  we formulate the caterpillar-like climbing problem as an end-effector tracking problem using the redundant robotics terminology. A dual-mode optimal controller;  which effectively resolves the end-effector tracking problem even when the robot configuration is ill-conditioned;  is incorporated for realizing the caterpillar-like climbing locomotion. Both simulation and experiment results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed caterpillar-like climbing method.
