Efficient and robust identification of the left ventricular borders remains a challenging problem in cardiology. In this paper;  we proposed an automatic method to segment the left ventricles and then identify their borders robustly. The proposed method is named as “ABDC” because it utilizes the strengths of four techniques: Automatic threshold selection; Boundary extraction;  Deformation flow tracking;  and Convex shape modeling. We compared the proposed method with the PDE optical flow method on 1660 images which are obtained from ten complete short-axis cine MRI datasets (five normal subjects and five patients). As it turned out;  the proposed method is more efficient and robust than the benchmark in segmenting LV borders.
