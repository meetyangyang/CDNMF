In manufacturing systems with large variety of products;  small- to medium-size production runs are typically carried out according to the customers' orders. When the volume of a production run is small;  the production system operates partially (or entirely) in the transient regime and the traditional steady-state analysis may become inapplicable. In this paper;  under the framework of serial production lines with finite buffers and with machines having the Bernoulli reliability model;  we study the problems of performance evaluation;  system-theoretic properties;  and bottleneck of such systems. Specifically;  we study the mathematical model for the one- and two-machine cases and derive analytical formulas to evaluate the performance measures of such systems. Then;  for longer lines;  a computationally efficient algorithm based on aggregation is developed to approximate the system performance measures with high accuracy. In addition;  the monotonicity and reversibility properties and completion time bottleneck are discussed. Finally;  a case study in a lighting equipment assembly plant is described to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.
