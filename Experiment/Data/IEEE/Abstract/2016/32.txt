Research and biomedical applications in cell surgery require transportation and rotation of biological cells. In these cell manipulation tasks;  the cell of interest must be translated and oriented properly such that the desired component;  such as the polar body or other organelles;  can be imaged with optical microscopy. This paper presents a holographic optical tweezers (HOT) based system to carry out automated translational control in the plane;  and rotational control about one rotational axes of a suspended cell. Based on the proposed general equations of motion of the cell;  held in an optical trap;  two controllers;  one for cell translational and one for rotational control;  are developed to translate and orient the cells to the desired position and orientation in a sequential manner. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
