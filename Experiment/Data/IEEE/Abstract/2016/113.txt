New paradigms in industrial robotics no longer require physical separation between robotic manipulators and humans. Moreover;  in order to optimize production;  humans and robots are expected to collaborate to some extent. In this scenario;  involving a shared environment between humans and robots;  common motion generation algorithms might turn out to be inadequate for this purpose. This paper proposes a kinematic control strategy which enforces safety;  while maintaining the maximum level of productivity of the robot. The resulting motion of the (possibly redundant) robot is obtained as an output of an optimization-based real-time algorithm in which safety is regarded as a hard constraint to be satisfied. The methodology is experimentally validated on a dual-arm concept robot with 7-DOF per arm performing a manipulation task.
