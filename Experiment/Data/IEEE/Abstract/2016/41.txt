A variety of wireless networks;  including applications of Wireless Sensor Networks;  Internet of Things;  and Cyber-physical Systems;  increasingly pervade our homes;  retail;  transportation systems;  and manufacturing processes. Traditional approaches communicate data from all sensors to a central system;  and users (humans or machines) query this central point for results;  typically via the web. As the number of deployed sensors;  and thus generated data streams;  is increasing exponentially;  this traditional approach may no longer be sustainable or desirable in some application contexts. Therefore;  new approaches are required to allow users to directly interact with the network;  for example;  requesting data directly from sensor nodes. This is difficult;  as it requires every node to be capable of point-to-point routing;  in addition to identifying a subset of nodes that can fulfil a user's query. This paper presents Dragon;  a platform that allows any node in the network to identify all nodes that satisfy user queries;  i.e.;  request data from nodes;  and relay the result to the user. The Dragon platform achieves this in a fully distributed way. No central orchestration is required;  network overheads are low;  and latency is improved over existing comparable methods. Dragon is evaluated on networks of various topologies and different network densities. It is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms based on summary trees;  like Innet and SENS-Join. Dragon is shown to outperform these approaches up to 88% in terms of network traffic required;  also a proxy for energy efficiency;  and 84% in terms of processing delay.
