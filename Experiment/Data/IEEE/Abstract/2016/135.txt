Dual-armed cluster tools for semiconductor manufacturing typically have had two arms fixed in opposite directions. Recently;  new cluster tool robot systems with two independent robot arms have been introduced with the expectation that the arms' flexibility will improve the throughput. However;  the productivity gain has yet to be examined. Accordingly;  we examine under which circumstances and the extent to which productivity gains can be achieved and how the robot task sequences should be scheduled to maximize the throughput. For this purpose;  we develop a Petri net model that represents the tool behavior. We show that the well-known swap sequence;  which is known to be optimal for conventional dual-armed tools;  is not always optimal. Instead;  we identify two other sequences that are optimal under certain conditions. We define the workloads for each process step and the transport module to derive conditions for optimality of the sequences;  based on the Petri net model and the workload. We also develop a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to determine optimal sequences among one-cyclic schedules for the cases in which the proposed sequences are not optimal. Furthermore;  we analyze and demonstrate how the two independent arms can increase the throughput in comparison to a conventional dual-armed robot.
