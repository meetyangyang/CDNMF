This paper analyzes the application of machine learning techniques to the control of a soft;  peristaltic;  xy-sorting table. In particular;  we address peristaltic tables made of a soft upper silicone layer and actuated by an array of integrated air-filled chambers. The chambers are pneumatically inflated in order to deform the table and move objects on the table. To control the robot precisely;  it is necessary to model both the inverse mapping between the control signals of the actuators and the resulting surface deformation. There is currently no parametric model available. In this paper;  we;  therefore;  study if nonparametric approaches are applicable. In these approaches;  the mapping would be learned from a database of input signals and observed behaviors. From our analysis;  we conclude that the most promising research direction consists in the nonparametric modeling of a limited set of peristaltic actuation patterns. However;  the nonlinear hardware design that impedes a parametric model also affects the nonparametric optimization process. Our simulation suggests that the optimization is nonconvex;  approximately monotonous;  and feasible in terms of the number of observations of the physical robot.
