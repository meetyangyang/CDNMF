Separated collection is an important part of waste management;  because it allows material recovery. In order to organize separate collection operations;  complex decisions need to be taken on the basis of a large amount of data. In this paper;  the problem of planning the door-to-door waste collection of multiple materials for a municipality is considered. A few contributions are available in the literature for this problem. A new mixed integer linear programming model is formalized and solved. A multiobjective optimization model is proposed;  aiming at minimizing both operational costs and possible inefficiencies of the recycling logistic system causing negative environmental impacts. The model is applied to a real case study and a mixed integer programming heuristic algorithm is used for its solution. The obtained results are discussed and conclusions are drawn.
