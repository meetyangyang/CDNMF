This paper presents a general modeling framework for Intermodal Freight Transport Terminals (IFTTs). The model allows simulating and evaluating the performance of such key elements of the intermodal transportation chain. Hence;  it may be used by the decision maker to identify the IFTT bottlenecks;  as well as to test different solutions to improve the IFTT dynamics. The proposed modeling framework is modular and based on timed Petri Nets (PNs);  where places represent resources and capacities or conditions;  transitions model inputs;  flows;  and activities into the terminal and tokens are intermodal transport units or the means on which they are transported. The model is able to represent the different types of existing IFTTs. Its effectiveness is tested first on an example from the literature and then on a real case study;  the railroad inland terminal of a leading Italian intermodal logistics company;  showing its ease of application. In the real case study;  using the proposed formalism we test the as-is IFTT performance and evaluate alternative possible to-be improvements in order to identify and eliminate emerging criticalities in the terminal dynamics.
