In this paper;  we propose a sensory cues guided robotic walker for improving gaits of Parkinson Disease (PD) patients. A completely non-intrusive;  3D real-time leg pose tracking and gait analysis are proposed by using a depth camera mounted on the rear of the robotic walker. It has been studied that the sensory cues can serve as effective stimuli to the PD patients for gait improvement. In our work;  the sensory cues including visual and auditory cues are incorporated into the robotic walker. More specifically;  both sensory cues are gait-adaptive;  of which the visual cue in particular is projected onto the ground by a projector installed on the walker;  in order to stimulate patients walking gait more easily. Since the adjustable cues can improve patients gaits and reduce their uncomfortableness simultaneously;  the hereby developed robotic walker serves as a gait rehabilitation mechanism. To demonstrate the performance of the developed walker;  several real experiments have been conducted. First;  the accuracy of the proposed 3D leg pose tracking is verified by a standard motion capture system. Next;  seven participants (4PD patients and 3 healthy elders) are recruited to test the system three days for verifying the effectiveness of participants gait improvement. The experimental results confirm the potential of the walker serving as a rehabilitation device for PD patients.
