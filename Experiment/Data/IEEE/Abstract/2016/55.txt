We consider a scheduling problem of a robotized cluster tool for semiconductor manufacturing;  which should control wafer delays within a chamber so as not to exceed a specified limit under time variation. The prior research has proposed a p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>+</sup>\n-time event graph;  an extension of Petri nets;  for modeling the scheduling problem and developed a method of verifying whether a cyclic p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>+</sup>\n-time event graph or a cluster tool;  which repeats identical work cycles;  can satisfy the time constraints under time variation. In this paper;  we extend and simplify the schedulability analysis method in the prior research for a noncyclic event graph or a cluster tool which performs start-up and close-down operation for a lot or lot switching;  and obtain specialized results. We assume that a robot task sequence or firing sequence of transitions is given. Based on the schedulability analysis;  we also propose a way of modifying a not always schedulable noncyclic p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>+</sup>\n-time event graph with some qualifications to be always schedulable;  that is;  we prolong token holding times at some places or equivalently delay firings of some transitions so as to be always feasible.
