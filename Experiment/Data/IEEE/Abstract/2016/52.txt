The generalized Hough transform (GHT) is widely used for detecting or locating objects under similarity transformation. However;  a weakness of the traditional GHT is its large storage requirement and time-consuming computational complexity due to the 4-D parameter space voting strategy. In this paper;  a polygon-invariant GHT (PI-GHT) algorithm;  as a novel scale- and rotation-invariant template matching method;  is presented for high-speed object vision-based positioning. To demonstrate the performance of PI-GHT;  several experiments were carried out to compare this novel algorithm with the other five popular matching methods. Experimental results show that the computational effort required by PI-GHT is smaller than that of the common methods due to the similarity transformations applied to the scale- and rotation-invariant triangle features. Moreover;  the proposed PI-GHT maintains inherent robustness against partial occlusion;  noise;  and nonlinear illumination changes;  because the local triangle features are based on the gradient directions of edge points. Consequently;  PI-GHT is implemented in packaging equipment for radio frequency identification devices at an average time of 4.13 ms and 97.06% matching rate;  to solder paste printing at average time nearly 5 ms with 99.87%. PI-GHT is applied to LED manufacturing equipment to locate multiobjects at least five times improvement in speed with a 96% matching rate.
