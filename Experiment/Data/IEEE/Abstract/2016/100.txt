Model integration enables the automated data flow of design changes between multidisciplinary models and improves the efficiency of collaborative multidisciplinary design. In this study;  a geometry-related profile of SysML is first proposed to specify the geometric information of mechanical structure to support the generation of initial CAD models from SysML models. Second;  a model comparison-based method is introduced to obtain the model changes to facilitate the incremental update between distributed heterogeneous models. Third;  a multidisciplinary design optimization based method is introduced to deal with the design conflicts that hinder model integration during multidisciplinary design. Finally;  a five-bar robot is used as a case study to demonstrate the whole proposed method.
