A new output feedback control design for robust velocity and altitude tracking of an air-breathing hypersonic vehicle (AHSV) is presented in this paper. The control scheme is performed on the assumption that only partial states of AHSV are measurable. The key idea is to employ the immersion and invariance approach to design globally asymptotically stable observers for the unmeasurable states. For controller design;  the whole control architecture is constructed using dynamic surface control;  based on the decomposition of the longitudinal dynamics of AHSV into velocity and altitude subsystems. Stability analysis is presented using the Lyapunov theory. Representative simulations are carried out on the high-fidelity model;  which illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.
