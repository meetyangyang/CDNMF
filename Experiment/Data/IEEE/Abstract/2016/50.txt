In this paper;  a new regression and reconstruction method for process monitoring is proposed. The main contributions of the proposed approaches are as follows: 1) a new nonlinear regression algorithm is proposed to extract the output-relevant variation;  which;  compared with the conventional algorithm;  builds a more direct relationship between the input and output variables; 2) the fault direction is determined by possible fault magnitude of every possible principal component; and 3) the fault is effectively diagnosed compared with the conventional kernel partial least-squares (KPLS) method. The proposed method is applied to a continuous annealing process and is compared with the KPLS method. Experiment results show that the proposed method can more effectively detect fault compared with the KPLS method. In addition;  the selection of fault direction is more accurate using the proposed reconstruction algorithm compared with the KPLS reconstruction approach.
