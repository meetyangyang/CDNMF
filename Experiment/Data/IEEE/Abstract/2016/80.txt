Accurate evaluation of the impacts of machine downtime incidents;  especially those that cause the most production loss;  is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources in multistage manufacturing systems. In this paper;  we focus on quantitative analysis of the impacts of downtime events in terms of production loss based on available production information. A complex station concept is introduced to represent a single station or a parallel structure in a production line. The dynamics of complex stations are studied. The real-time analysis of the impact of a downtime event in a parallel production line and in a serial production line is demonstrated to be consistent. Apart from the analytic study;  a computational procedure using real-time production information is developed. A case study is conducted to demonstrate its potential on real-time production control and resource/budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.
