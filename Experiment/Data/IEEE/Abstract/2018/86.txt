This paper presents an efficient method;  which reconstructs the temperature field around the tool/chip interface from infrared (IR) thermal images;  for online monitoring the internal peak temperature of the cutting tool. The tool temperature field is divided into two regions; namely;  a far field for solving the heat-transfer coefficient between the tool and ambient temperature;  and a near field where an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to account for the unknown heat variations at the frictional contact interface. Methods to extract physics-based feature points from the IR image as ANN inputs are discussed. The effects of image resolution;  feature selection;  chip occlusion;  contact heat variation;  and measurement noises on the estimated contact temperature are analyzed numerically and experimentally. The proposed method has been verified by comparing the ANN-estimated surface temperatures against “true values” experimentally obtained using a high-resolution IR imager on a custom-designed testbed as well as numerically simulated using finite-element analysis. The concept feasibility of the temperature monitoring method is demonstrated on an industrial lathe-turning center with a commercial tool insert.
