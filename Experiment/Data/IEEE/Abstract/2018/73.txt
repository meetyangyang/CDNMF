In sharing economy;  people offer idle social resources to others in a sharing manner. Through community-based online platforms;  the people offering services can earn commission while others can enjoy a better life via renting social resources. Consequently;  the value-in-use of services is expectedly strengthened within the unit time;  although the total amount of social resources remains constant. Influenced by sharing economy;  some famous companies have developed intelligent systems to analyze the most appropriate coincidence between citizens' idle supply and renting demand from numerous data sets. However;  the big data analysis of the optimal service-demand matching usually runs on the traditional multiprocessors equipped in intelligent systems;  so-called “system-on-chip.” In this paper;  we design a novel computer architecture - the accelerator based on optical network-on-chip (ONoC) - to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. Our ONoC-based accelerator is able to quickly calculate the optimal service-demand matching by processing computation tasks on parallel cores;  i.e.;  task-core mapping. In addition;  to improve the accelerator reliability;  the assorted task-core mapping algorithm is also designed. The extensive simulation results based on real trace file demonstrate the effectiveness of our system and algorithm.
