Feature detection on smooth free-form surfaces is much more difficult than that on shapes with sharp features. In this paper;  we extract the curved reflection axes (CRAs) of an arbitrary free-form surface as features if they exist. The extraction result is robust to boundary noises and strongly sensitive to extrinsic properties of the surface such as projected normals and curvatures. Compared with the general reflection symmetry;  curved reflection symmetry is defined to be a reflection symmetry along a smooth 3D embedded curve instead of a plane;  where any point on the curve is a local reflection center for some surface points. The properties of the curved reflection symmetric axis are analyzed;  and a novel computational model for detecting and extracting CRAs on free-form surfaces is presented. The experimental results are then compared with both the medial axis and the intrinsic symmetric axis;  which are two popular feature representations of 3D shapes;  and the advantages and uniqueness of the proposed method are convincingly demonstrated. An application of the proposed method in sweep scanning is also presented. Other applications of the proposed method include feature extraction;  shape symmetrization;  segmentation;  and registration.
