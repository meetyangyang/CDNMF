This paper presents a novel multiscale neighborhood normalization-based multiple dynamic principal component analysis (MNN-MDPCA) method to detect the fault in complex batch processes with frequent operations. Since the difference between batches is larger under random frequent operations according to phase;  the corresponding monitoring model should be changed accordingly. However;  the data quantity is small under a single operation at each phase;  the data with similar operations can be clustered together. Due to frequent operations;  the data clustered follows non-Gaussian distribution. A normalization strategy called MNN is proposed to complete Gaussian distribution conversion so as to build multivariate statistical model. Subsequently;  MDPCA is used to model the multioperation industry processes. Finally;  to test the modeling and monitoring performance of the proposed method;  a numerical example and the ladle furnace (LF) steelmaking process case are provided;  where the comparison with Gaussian mixture model and MDPCA-based results is covered.
