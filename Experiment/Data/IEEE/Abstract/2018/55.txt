This paper presents a time efficient finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) scheme for the doubly fed induction generator system. In this scheme;  the switching states of the rotor side converter are directly taken as control inputs. This way;  the optimized control action can be directly applied to the converter. Compared with the existing FCS-MPC approaches;  the salient feature of the proposed scheme is the reduction of the computation time. By introducing a set of augmented decision variables;  the original intractable binary quadratic programming problem in FCS-MPC can be analytically transformed to a binary linear programming problem;  which can be solved efficiently. By this means;  the computation time of the proposed scheme is much less than that of the existing schemes. This reduction in computation time enables FCS-MPC with longer prediction horizons;  thus yielding better control performance.
