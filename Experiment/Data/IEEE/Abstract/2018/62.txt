The effective dismantling of discarded products regardless being used or not is critically important to their reuse;  recovery;  and recycling. However;  the existing product disassembly planning methods pay little or no attention to resource constraints;  e.g.;  limited numbers of disassembly operators and tools. Thus;  a resulting plan when being executed may be ineffective in practice. This paper presents a dual-objective optimization model for selective disassembly sequences by considering multiresource constraints such that disassembly profit is maximized and time is minimized. A scatter search is adopted to solve the proposed dual-objective optimization model. It embodies the generation of diverse initial solutions;  global assessment of objective functions;  a crossover combination operator;  a local search strategy for improved solutions;  and a reference set update method. To analyze the effect of different weights on its performance;  simulations are conducted on different products. Its effectiveness is verified by comparing its optimization results and those of genetic local search.
