Collisions between automated moving equipment and human workers in job sites are one of the main sources of fatalities and accidents during the execution of construction projects. In this paper;  we present a methodology to identify and assess project plans in terms of hazards before their execution. Our methodology has the following steps: 1) several potential plans are extracted from an initial activity graph; 2) plans are translated from a high-level activity graph to a discrete-event simulation model; 3) trajectories and safety policies are generated that avoid static and moving obstacles using existing motion planning algorithms; 4) safety scores and risk-based heatmaps are calculated based on the trajectories of moving equipment; and 5) managerial implications are provided to select an acceptable plan with the aid of a sensitivity analysis of different factors (cost;  resources;  and deadlines) that affect the safety of a plan. Finally;  we present illustrative case study examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our model.
