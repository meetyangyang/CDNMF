This paper discusses a new control approach for robotic-assisted tele-echography. The control architecture follows a hierarchical approach;  where explicit Cartesian force control arises as the primary task while orientation control is designed in the null space. The robot dynamics is driven by a 3-D time-of-flight camera and a force sensor. Based on depth camera and force data;  contact stiffness is anticipated;  allowing control adaptation before contact. This approach is adequate for tele-echographic tasks since it reduces robot dynamics before contact;  enabling a smooth transition from free space to contact and vice versa. In contact;  the environment stiffness is estimated online using force data and the manipulator inertial properties. A strong correlation between the stiffness perceived by the controller and the effective mass exists;  being this correlation used in the estimation algorithm to improve force control performance. A set of experiments assess the control architecture;  highlighting the relation between perceived stiffness and robot effective mass;  including also clinical validation.
