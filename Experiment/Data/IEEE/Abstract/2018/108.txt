The aim of behavioral identification of discrete-event systems is to build;  from a sequence of observed inputs/outputs events;  an understandable model that exhibits both the direct relations between inputs and outputs events (i.e.;  the observable behavior of the system) and the internal state evolutions (i.e.;  the unobservable behavior). Since parallelism hinders the construction of monolithic models;  distributed identification builds instead the models of subsystems. This paper proposes an automated partitioning of the system and optimal regarding the readability of the identified distributed models;  thus fitting reverse-engineering purposes. To solve the optimization problem;  a first solution is extracted from the observable behavior; then additional solutions are computed by agglomerative clustering. The approach is applied to a benchmark;  resulting in an adequate functional partition.
