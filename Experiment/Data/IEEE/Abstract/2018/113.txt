We present a Kalman filter-based approach for estimating external forces and torques relying on a dynamic model of a serial-chain robotic manipulator where only motor signals (currents;  joint angles;  and joint speeds) are measurable. The method does not require any additional sensing compared to standard robot control systems. The approach exploits redundancy in 7DOF arms;  but also applies to traditional 6DOF manipulators. Automatic filter calibration routines are presented minimizing the number of parameters that must be tuned in order to successfully apply the proposed scheme and to optimize estimation quality. The approach is verified by measurement data gathered from an ABB YuMi;  a dual-arm collaborative robot with 7DOF each arm. Furthermore;  measurement results are presented employing force and torque estimates in a compliance control scheme;  verifying that the estimation quality achieved is improved compared to existing approaches and is sufficient to employ the estimates in force-controlled applications.
