Autonomous and semiautonomous mobile robots play an important role in making tasks in environments considered hostile or dangerous for a human being. In order to execute many of the required tasks;  robots need;  in its architecture;  a module of navigation with an appropriate path planning algorithm. This paper presents the development and implementation of a methodology for path planning of a mobile robot using a spherical algorithm and homotopy continuation methods (HCMs). The first section is a brief introduction about HCMs. Subsequently;  the homotopy path planning method and spherical path tracking algorithm are explained;  as well as the upgraded version and its main features. Then;  the main contributions of this paper are presented and the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved. Besides;  numerical examples;  implementation results in multiple platforms including a 32b microcontroller and robot operating system;  are displayed. Finally;  some favorable results from a comparative between the proposed methodology against sampling-based planners using the open motion planning library are presented.
