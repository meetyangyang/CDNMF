In this paper;  a home Internet-of-Things system is analyzed by dividing it into four layers;  i.e.;  the node layer;  gateway layer;  service layer;  and open layer. The gateway layer;  which supports a variety of wireless technologies and is the core of home wireless networks access unit;  together with the node layer constitutes the home wireless network. A gateway prototype following the proposed architecture has been implemented. A testbed of an interference-aware wireless network which includes the gateway prototype has also been created for testing its user interaction performances. The experimental results show that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth have an impact on the ZigBee communication. Considering the complex scene of home and building;  ZigBee multihop communications are set to reduce the packet loss probability. In addition;  an event-level-based transmission control strategy is proposed;  in which the packet loss probability of wireless network is reduced by controlling the transmission priority of different levels of monitoring events;  and optimizing the ZigBee wireless network channel occupancy.
