This paper explores the execution of planned autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions where opportunities to achieve additional utility can arise during execution. The missions are represented as temporal planning problems;  with hard goals and time constraints. Opportunities are soft goals with high utility. The probability distributions for the occurrences of these opportunities are not known;  but it is known that they are unlikely;  so it is not worth trying to anticipate their occurrence prior to plan execution. However;  as they are high utility;  it is worth trying to address them dynamically when they are encountered;  as long as this can be done without sacrificing the achievement of the hard goals of the problem. We formally characterize the opportunistic planning problem;  introduce a novel approach to opportunistic planning;  and compare it with an on-board replanning approach in the domain of AUVs performing pillar expection and chain-following tasks.
