This paper presents an efficient algorithm to test whether a planar object can be caged by a formation of point agents (point fingertips or point mobile robots). The algorithm is based on a space mapping between the 2-D work space (W space) and the 3-D configuration space (C space) of the given agent formation. When performing caging test on a planar object;  the algorithm looks up the space mapping to recover the C space of the given agent formation;  labels the recovered C space;  and counts the number of labeled surfaces to judge the success of caging. The algorithm is able to work with various planar shapes;  including objects with convex boundaries;  concave boundaries;  or holes. It can also respond quickly to varying agent formations and different object shapes. Experiments and analysis on different objects and fingertip formations demonstrate the completeness;  robustness;  and efficiency of our proposal.
