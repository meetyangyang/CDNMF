A growing number of companies deploy their applications in green data centers (GDCs) and provide services to tasks of global users. Currently;  a growing number of GDC providers aim to maximize their profit by deploying green energy facilities and decreasing brown energy consumption. However;  the temporal variation in the revenue;  price of grid;  and green energy in tasks' delay bounds makes it challenging for GDC providers to achieve profit maximization while strictly guaranteeing delay constraints of all admitted tasks. Unlike existing studies;  a timeaware task scheduling (TATS) algorithm that investigates the temporal variation and schedules all admitted tasks to execute in GDC meeting their delay bounds is proposed. In addition;  this paper provides the mathematical modeling of task refusal and service rates. In each iteration;  TATS solves the formulated profit maximization problem by hybrid chaotic particle swarm optimization based on simulated annealing. Compared with several existing scheduling algorithms;  TATS can increase profit and throughput without violating delay constraints of all admitted tasks.
