Tolerance is an essential part of design and manufacturing. It plays a key role in product quality and manufacturing costs. Understanding and controlling production variations on key geometric features can provide firms with a competitive edge. A model to link production variation to tolerance is highly desirable but difficult to build;  especially for deformable parts with complex surfaces. Inspired by an innovative idea of volumetric space envelope (constructed from a base parametric curve);  this paper proposes a novel spatial tolerance model. In this proposal;  a volumetric envelope is superimposed onto the target manufacturing part;  whose deformation and deviation (during manufacturing or assembly) are viewed as spatial variation;  and this variation is modeled and linked to movements of envelope's control points. This unique model design bypasses direct modeling of complex intrapart interactions;  which is nonlinear in general and a major source of inaccuracy and low efficiency of many existing methods. The adopted indirect modeling brings many benefits. It can handle complex shapes and surfaces;  and is able to take into account form errors. Also;  it is capable of modeling both global and local variations observed in many practical cases. The new method is illustrated and verified through an example on a deformable vehicle door hinge plate. The proposed model shows application potential in every major stage of production;  and makes possible to build a coherent cross-production life-cycle tolerancing framework from the early stage design;  to manufacturing;  to postproduction quality inspection.
