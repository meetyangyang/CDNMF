Early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer are of significant importance. In this paper;  a system-theoretic method is introduced to analyze the diagnosis-to-treatment process for lung cancer patients who receive surgical resections. The complex care delivery process is decomposed into a collection of serial processes;  each consisting of combinations of various tests and procedures. Closed formulas are derived to estimate the mean and coefficient of variation of waiting time during the diagnosis-to-surgery process. Simple indicators based on the data collected on the clinic/hospital floor are derived to identify the bottlenecks;  i.e.;  the waiting times that impede the whole delivery process in the strongest manner. In addition;  by approximating waiting times using Gamma distributions;  an algorithm is introduced to evaluate the waiting-time performance;  i.e.;  the probability to finish the diagnosis-to-surgery process within a desired or given time interval. Finally;  a case study at Baptist Memorial Health System is introduced to illustrate the applicability of the method and provide recommendations for improvement.
