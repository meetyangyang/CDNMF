Series machines;  i.e.;  machines (which are usually unreliable) arranged in series with no buffering;  are pervasive in production systems. In the analysis;  design;  and optimization of the series-machine system;  the efficiency analysis is one of the most fundamental issues. There are not a lot of researches analyzing the efficiency of the series-machine system;  and almost all of them assume that the system operates under type-I failure mechanisms (i.e.;  the breakdown of a machine could make all other series machines forced down) rather than under type-II mechanisms (i.e.;  the breakdown of a machine does not make any other series machines forced down). The reason that the type-I failure mechanisms are usually assumed in the literature is that the analysis of the series-machine system under type-II mechanisms is much more complex than under type-I mechanisms;  although type-II mechanisms are more common in practice. To thoroughly and systematically estimate the efficiency of the series-machine system;  in this paper;  we propose a unified analytical approach to investigate the efficiency under both type-I and type-II failure mechanisms. Both cases of deterministic and random cycle times are considered. Different from under type-I failure mechanisms;  analytical expressions of the efficiency of series-machine systems under type-II failure mechanisms are extremely hard to obtain;  and thus;  limit bounds of the efficiency are derived and algorithms are developed to calculate its exact value. Results show that the series-machine system under type-II failure mechanisms is more efficient than under type-I mechanisms;  which;  intuitively making sense;  is the reason that type-II mechanisms are more common in the industry.
