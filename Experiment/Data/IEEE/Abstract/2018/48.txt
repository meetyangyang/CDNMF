Multifinger caging offers a robust object grasping approach. However;  while efficient computation of two-finger caging grasps is well developed;  the computation of three-finger caging grasps has remained a challenge. This paper considers the caging of polygonal objects with three-finger hands which maintain an equilateral triangle formation during the grasping process. While the c-space of such hands is 4-D;  their contact space that represents all two and three finger contacts along the grasped object's boundary forms a 2-D stratified manifold. The paper describes a caging graph that can be constructed in the hand's relatively simple contact space. Starting from a desired immobilizing grasp of the polygonal object;  the caging graph can be readily searched for the largest finger opening that maintains a three-finger cage about the object to be grasped. Any equilateral finger placement within the corresponding caging regions guarantees robust object grasping.
