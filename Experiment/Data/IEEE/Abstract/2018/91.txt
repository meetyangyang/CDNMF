The ability to calculate rigid-body transformations between arbitrary coordinate systems (i.e.;  registration) is an invaluable tool in robotics. This effort builds upon previous work by investigating strategies for improving the registration accuracy between a robotic arm and an extrinsic coordinate system with relatively inexpensive parts and minimal labor. The framework previously presented is expanded with a new test methodology to characterize the effects of strategies that improve registration performance. In addition;  statistical analyses of physical trials reveal that leveraging more data and applying machine learning are two major components for significantly reducing registration error. One-shot peg-in-hole tests are conducted to show the application-level performance gains obtained by improving registration accuracy. Trends suggest that the maximum translation positioning error (postregistration) is a good;  albeit not perfect;  indicator for peg insertion performance.
