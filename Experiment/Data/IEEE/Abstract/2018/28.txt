In this paper;  we present a methodology based on constrained optimization methods for estimating and compensating for post-contact parasitic object motions for underactuated;  compliant robot hands and for deriving stable;  minimal effort grasps to try to minimize these movements. To do so;  we compute the object motions for different hand designs;  object shapes;  and object sizes and we synthesize appropriate robot arm trajectories that eliminate them;  even in hands with complex flexure-based compliant members. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated using a seven DOF robot arm (Barrett WAM) and a range of compliant underactuated robot hands (Yale OpenHand models T42PP;  T42PF;  and T42FF).
