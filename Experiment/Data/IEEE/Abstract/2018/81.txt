Controlling the gripping force on fragile objects has been a challenging task for industrial grippers. The solution often requires an electric gripper with embedded force sensors and control feedback. This approach is costly and leads to extra gripper complexity. To avoid damage while handling fragile objects;  this paper presents a novel force regulation mechanism (FRM) to be installed on pneumatic grippers. Without using additional sensors and control;  the FRM can passively produce an adjustable contact force between the gripper jaws and objects of various sizes. Together with pneumatic grippers that have a higher gripping speed;  lower cost;  and simpler structure;  this approach offers a more attractive solution than the use of electric grippers. In this paper;  the design and analysis of the FRM are presented. A prototype of the FRM is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of force regulation. This novel mechanism is expected to serve as a reliable alternative for fragile object manipulation.
