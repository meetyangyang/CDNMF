This paper addresses the fault detection and isolation (FDI) problem for robotic assembly of electrical connectors in the framework of set-membership. Both the fault-free and faulty cases of assembly are modeled by different switched linear models with known switching sequences;  bounded parameters;  and external disturbances. The locations of switching points of each model are assumed to be inside some areas but the accurate positions are not clear. Given current input/output data;  the feasible parameter set of fault-free switched linear model is obtained by sequentially calculating an optimal ellipsoid. If the pair of data is not consistent with any possible submodel;  a fault is then detected. The isolation of fault is realized by checking the consistency between the data sequence and each possible fault model one by one. The robustness of the proposed FDI algorithms is proved. The effectiveness of these algorithms is verified by the robotic assembly experiments of mating electrical connectors.
