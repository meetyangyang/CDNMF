In this paper;  we have designed the vector fields (VFs) for all the six joints (hip;  knee;  and ankle) of a bipedal walking model. The bipedal gait is the manifestation of temporal changes in the six joints angles;  two each for hip;  knee;  and ankle values and it is a combination of seven different discrete subphases. Developing the correct joint trajectories for all the six joints was difficult from a purely mechanics-based model due to its inherent complexities. To get the correct and exact joint trajectories;  it is very essential for a modern bipedal robot to walk stably. By designing the VF correctly;  we are able to get the stable joint trajectory ranges and able to reproduce angle ranges from theses designed VFs. This is purely a data driven computational modeling approach;  which is based on the hypothesis that morphologically similar structure (human-robot) can adopt similar gait patterns. To validate the correctness of the design;  we have applied all the possible combination of joint trajectories to HOAP-2 bipedal robot;  which could walk successfully maintaining its stability. The VF provides joint trajectories for a particular joint. The results show that our data driven computational model is able to provide the correct joints angle ranges;  which are stable.
