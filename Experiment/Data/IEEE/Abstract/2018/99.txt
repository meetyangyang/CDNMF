As wafer circuit widths shrink down;  wafer fabrication processes require stringent quality control. Therefore;  fabs recently tend to clean a chamber after processing each wafer;  in order to remove chemical residuals within the chamber. Such chamber cleaning;  called purge operation;  increases scheduling complexity in robotized cluster tools. In this paper;  we examine scheduling problems of single-armed cluster tools with purge operations for series-parallel chambers. By extending the wellknown backward sequence;  we propose a backward(z) sequence that allows partial loading for parallel chambers;  where vector z specifies how many chambers zi of each process step i are kept empty for cleaning. We then propose a way of finding optimal vector z* and identify when backward(z*) achieves the minimum cycle time among all possible sequences. We present experimental results on the accuracy of backward(z*).
