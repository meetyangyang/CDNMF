It becomes more and more critical for manufacturing enterprises to improve energy efficiency because of the escalating energy prices;  increasing global competitions;  and more rigorous government regulations. In this paper;  a systematic method is developed to improve the energy efficiency of a multistage manufacturing system through production control. The method aims at reducing energy consumption with minimal negative impact on production. We start from the analysis of system dynamics and develop quantitative methods to estimate energy saving opportunities. A supervisory control algorithm is developed to improve system energy efficiency by periodically taking the saving opportunities. Simulation case studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of the control algorithm.
