This paper presents an overview of the inaugural Amazon Picking Challenge along with a summary of a survey conducted among the 26 participating teams. The challenge goal was to design an autonomous robot to pick items from a warehouse shelf. This task is currently performed by human workers;  and there is hope that robots can someday help increase efficiency and throughput while lowering cost. We report on a 28-question survey posed to the teams to learn about each team's background;  mechanism design;  perception apparatus;  planning;  and control approach. We identify trends in this data;  correlate it with each team's success in the competition;  and discuss observations and lessons learned based on survey results and the authors' personal experiences during the challenge.
