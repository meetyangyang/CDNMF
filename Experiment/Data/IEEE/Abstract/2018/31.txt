This paper addresses the leader-follower consensus problem of multivehicle wirelessly networked uncertain systems with nonlinear dynamics and actuator fault and proposes a class of distributed discontinuous communication protocols based only on the relative states among neighboring vehicles. By introducing a novel fault model for multivehicle wirelessly networked uncertain systems;  fault tolerant consensus can be achieved with different fault modes of the actuators. It is proved in the sense of Lyapunov that;  if the conditions of dwell time and the intermittent communication rate are satisfied;  the leader-follower consensus can be achieved for closed-loop multivehicle wirelessly networked uncertain systems with nonlinear dynamics and actuator fault under the topology that frequently but not always contains a spanning tree rooted at the leader. Furthermore;  the results are extended to the collision avoidance and formulation control problems. Four examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
