Crop cultivar identification is an important aspect in agricultural systems. Traditional solutions involve excessive human interventions;  which is labor-intensive and timeconsuming. In addition;  cultivar identification is a typical task of fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC). Compared with other common topics in FGVC;  studies of this problem are somewhat lagging and limited. In this paper;  targeting four Chinese maize cultivars of Jundan No.20;  Wuyue No.3;  Nongda No.108;  and Zhengdan No.958;  we first consider the problem of identifying the maize cultivar based on its tassel characteristics by computer vision. In particular;  a novel fine-grained maize cultivar identification data set termed HUST-FG-MCI that contains 5000 images is first constructed. To better capture the textual differences in a weakly supervised manner;  we proposed an effective deep convolutional neural network and Fisher vector (FV)based feature encoding mechanism. The mechanism tends to highlight subtle object patterns via filter-specific convolutional representations and thus provides strong discrimination for cultivar identification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. We show also that FV encoding can weaken the linear dependency between convolutional activations;  redundant filters exist in the convolutional layer;  and high accuracy can be maintained with relatively low-dimensional convolutional features and one or two Gaussian components in FV.
