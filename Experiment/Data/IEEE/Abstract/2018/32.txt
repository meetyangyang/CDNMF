The emitting distributions of a hidden Markov model (HMM) are normally constructed using the cross moments of the process variables. Similar to the mean of a univariate probability distribution;  the cross moment is the most fundamental statistic of a multivariate probability distribution;  which is not capable of capturing the high-order statistical features of process data. To alleviate this limitation;  the high-order equivalence of the cross moment demonstrated in this paper;  as the complete dependence structure;  is used to construct the emitting distribution for HMM. The complete dependence structure among the process variables is modeled in a Gaussian copula. A semiparametric data transformation is also proposed to ensure the necessary conditions for using a Gaussian copula are met. The final emitting distribution is constructed as a finite mixture of the copula models. The proposed HMM is tested on two industrial studies for performance validation.
