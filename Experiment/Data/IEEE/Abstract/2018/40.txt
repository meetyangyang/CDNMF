We discuss state-of-the-art intelligent robotic aircraft with the special focus on evolutionary autopilots for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Under the umbrella of adaptive autopilots;  we highlight the pros and cons of the most widely implemented intelligent algorithms against the navigational and maneuvering capabilities of small UAVs. We present several cutting-edge applications of bioinspired flight control systems that have the capability of self-learning. We also highlight several research opportunities and challenges associated with each technique.
