The quay crane scheduling problem (QCSP) is one of the most important problems for the operations at container ports. The QCSP aims to decide a QC schedule for loading and unloading containers so as to minimize the vessel turnaround time. The QCSP is subject to various kinds of constraints;  e.g.;  task precedence constraints and QC noninterference constraints. This paper extends the QCSP by taking into consideration the stability constraints;  which are crucial for the safety reason but often omitted in the existing literature. We provide a mathematical model for the QCSP with stability constraints (QCSPSCs). A bicriteria evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve the QCSPSC. The algorithm consists of a sliding-window heuristic to fix the schedule;  which violates the stability constraints. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The computational results of the traditional QCSP and the QCSPSC are also compared and analyzed.
