In current practice;  product developers with customized small batch production needs come across the problem of finding capable and flexible manufacturers;  whereas manufacturers face underutilization due to inconsistent demand. This paper presents a Production as a Service (PaaS) framework to connect users (consumers or product developers) who have customized small batch manufacturing needs with manufacturers who have existing underutilized resources. PaaS is a cloud-based;  centralized framework based on a service-oriented architecture that abstracts the manufacturing steps of a product as individual (production) service requests. Using PaaS;  the user is able to reach many capable manufacturers at once and receive quotations for the production request. On the other end;  PaaS reduces the effort required to find new customers and enables the manufacturers to easily submit quotations to increase the utilization of their resources. The functionalities and concepts defined in this paper are illustrated through case studies.
