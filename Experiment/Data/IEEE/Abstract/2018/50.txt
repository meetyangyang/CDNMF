This paper considers an assembly problem. Let there be two interlocking parts;  only one of which may be cut into pieces. How many pieces should we cut the divisible part into to separate the parts using a sequence of rigid-body motions? In this initial exploration;  we primarily consider 2-D polygonal parts. This paper presents an algorithm that computes a lower bound on the number of pieces that the divisible part must be cut into. This paper also presents a complete algorithm that constructs a set of cuts and a motion plan for disassembly;  yielding an upper bound on the required number of pieces. Applications of the future extension of this paper to 3-D may include robot self-assembly;  interlocking 3-D model design;  search-and-rescue;  packaging;  and robotic surgery.
