Emerging applications of robots with direct physical interactions with humans have led to the development of a variety of series elastic actuators (SEAs) which are compliant;  force controllable;  and back drivable. The performance of current SEAs is mainly dependent on the specific stiffness of the spring. In our previous work;  a compliant actuator with two-stage stiffness has been designed to overcome the performance limitations in current SEAs. The key novelty is that a low-stiffness spring and a high-stiffness spring are employed instead of a single spring in current SEAs;  which has the advantages of high fidelity;  low output impedance;  and also large force range and bandwidth. In this paper;  a tracking control scheme is proposed for the compliant actuator with two-stage stiffness. Although the overall stiffness is discontinuous;  the proposed controller is continuous by integrating different control modes for two springs into a single one. The transition between control modes is smooth and embedded inside the controller;  and it is also automatically realized by monitoring the output force of the actuator. The stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are analyzed;  and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.\n<p xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><i>
