In order to realize many of the potential benefits associated with robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery;  the robot must be more than a remote controlled device. Currently;  using a surgical robot can be challenging;  fatiguing;  and time-consuming. Teaching the robot to actively assist surgical tasks;  such as suturing;  has the potential to vastly improve both the patient's outlook and the surgeon's efficiency. One obstacle to completing surgical sutures autonomously is the difficulty in tracking surgical suture threads. This paper presents novel stereo image processing algorithms for the detection;  initialization;  and tracking of a surgical suture thread. A nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curve is used to model a thin;  deformable;  and dynamic length thread. The NURBS model is initialized and grown from a single selected point located on the thread. The NURBS curve is optimized by minimizing the image matching energy between the projected stereo NURBS image and the segmented thread image. The algorithms are evaluated using suture threads;  a calibrated test pattern;  and a simulated thread image. In addition;  the accuracies of the algorithms presented are validated as they track a suture thread undergoing translation;  deformation;  and apparent length changes. All of the tracking is in real time.
