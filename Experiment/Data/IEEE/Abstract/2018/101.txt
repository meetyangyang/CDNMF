Disassembly planning aims to search the best disassembly sequences of a given obsolete/used product in terms of economic and environmental performances. A practical disassembly process may face great uncertainty owing to various unpredictable factors. To handle it;  researchers have addressed the stochastic cost and time problems of product disassembly. In reality;  the uncertain environment of product disassembly is associated with both randomness and fuzziness. Besides uncertain disassembly cost and time;  the quality of disassembled components/parts in a process has uncertainty and thus needs to be assessed via expert opinions/subjects. To do so;  this paper presents a new AND/OR-graph-based disassembly sequence planning problem by considering uncertain component quality and varying disassembly operational cost. Important disassembly planning models are built on the basis of different disassembly criteria. A novel hybrid intelligent algorithm integrating fuzzy simulation and artificial bee colony is proposed to solve them. Its effectiveness is well illustrated through several numerical cases and comparison with a prior method;  i.e.;  fuzzy-simulation-based genetic algorithm.
