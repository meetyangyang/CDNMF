Recent emergence of safe;  lightweight;  and flexible robots has opened a new realm for human-robot collaboration in manufacturing. Utilizing such robots with the new human-robot interaction (HRI) functionality to interact closely and effectively with a human co-worker;  we propose a novel framework for integrating HRI factors (both physical and social interactions) into the robot motion controller for human-robot collaborative assembly tasks in a manufacturing hybrid cell. To meet human physical demands in such assembly tasks;  an optimal control problem is formulated for physical HRI (pHRI)-based robot motion control to keep pace with human motion progress. We further augment social HRI (sHRI) into the framework by considering a computational model of the human worker's trust in his/her robot partner as well as robot facial expressions. The human worker's trust in robot is computed and used as a metric for path selection as well as a constraint in the optimal control problem. Robot facial expression is displayed for providing additional visual feedbacks to the human worker. We evaluate the proposed framework by designing a robotic experimental testbed and conducting a comprehensive study with a human-in-the-loop. Results of this paper show that compared to the manual adjustments of robot velocity;  an autonomous controller based on pHRI;  pHRI and sHRI with trust;  or pHRI and sHRI with trust;  and emotion result in 34%;  39%;  and 44% decrease in human workload and 21%;  32%;  and 60% increase in robot's usability;  respectively. Compared to the manual framework;  human trust in robot increases by 38% and 42%;  respectively;  in the latter two autonomous frameworks. Moreover;  the overall efficiency in terms of assembly time remains the same.
