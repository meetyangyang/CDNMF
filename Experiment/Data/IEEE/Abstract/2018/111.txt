This paper proposes a robust fault detection and isolation (FDI) approach that combines active and passive robust FDI approaches. Standard active FDI approaches obtain robustness by using the unknown input observer (UIO) to decouple unknown inputs from residuals. Differently;  standard passive FDI approaches achieve robustness by using the set theory to bound the effect of uncertain factors (disturbances and noises). In this paper;  we combine the UIO-based and the set-based approaches to produce a mixed robust FDI;  which can mitigate the disadvantages and exert the advantages of the two robust FDI approaches. In order to emphasize the role of set theory;  the UIO design based on the set theory is named as the set-theoretic UIO (SUIO). A quadrotor subsystem is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDI approach.
