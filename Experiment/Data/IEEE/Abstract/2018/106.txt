An uncalibrated visual servo method based on projective homography;  denoted as Projective Homography based Uncalibrated Visual Servoing (PHUVS);  is proposed in this paper;  in which a novel task function based on the element of projective homography is devised to realize visual servo without a prior knowledge of the camera intrinsic parameters and hand-eye relationships. The main advantage of this method is that it is not only suitable for totally uncalibrated scenarios but also cheap in computation costs when compared with classical image-based uncalibrated visual servoing methods. Numerical experiments are performed and the results confirm that the new approach is capable of both static positioning and dynamic tracking tasks;  and presents competitive computational efficiency and accuracy performance.
