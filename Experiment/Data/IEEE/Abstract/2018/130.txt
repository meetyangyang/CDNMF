In recent days;  many interacted shape products have been developed by manufacturing industries for different applications in various fields such as defense;  aerospace;  and space centers. In manufacturing;  30% of time consumption is due to assembly operation compared with the remaining processes in manufacturing. It is very difficult to get optimal sequence because assembly sequence planning is a multimodel optimization problem. As the number of parts in the assembly increases;  the possible number of sequences increases exponentially therefore obtaining the optimal assembly sequence becomes more difficult and time consuming. There exist many mathematical algorithms to obtain optimal assembly sequences. But;  recent studies state that they perform poorly when it comes to multiobjective optimal assembly sequence. In recent years;  researchers have developed several soft computing-based algorithms for solving assembly sequence problems. In this paper;  assembly subset detection method has been introduced. The proposed method is applied for the first time to solve assembly sequence problems. This method eliminates those assembly sets that have more directional changes and require more energy. The method is compared with other algorithms;  namely;  genetic algorithm (GA);  enhanced GA;  ant colony optimization (ACO);  memetic algorithm;  imperialistic harmonic search algorithm;  and flower pollination algorithm (FPA);  and is found to be successful in achieving the optimal assembly sequence for an industrial product with smaller number of iterations.
