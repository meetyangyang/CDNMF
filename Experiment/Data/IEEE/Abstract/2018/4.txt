Positioning of micro-nanoobjects inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for manipulation is a key and challenging task to perform. Often it is performed by skilled operators via teleoperation;  which is tedious and lacks repeatability. In this paper;  rendering this task as an image-guided problem;  we present a frequency domain scheme for automatic control of positioning platform movements. The designed controller uses the relative global image motion computed using the frequency spectral information of the images as visual signal and can provide control up to five degrees of freedom. The proposed approach is validated in simulations as well as experimentally using a high-resolution piezo-positioning platform mounted inside a SEM vacuum chamber. The obtained results quantify the performance of the proposed nanopositioning scheme.
