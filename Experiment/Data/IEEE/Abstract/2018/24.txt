The demand of indoor localization has recently grown quickly in industries. In general;  a localization system is required to be reliable;  fast;  and have high accuracy. In this paper;  the ultrawideband (UWB) technique is combined with the inertial navigation sensor (INS) to form a coupled UWB/INS localization framework;  which inherits the advantages from both components. A minimum variance unbiased finite impulse response (MVU FIR) method is then applied to obtain accurate position and velocity estimations from noisy measurements. Two experiments and several simulations are conducted. Compared with the traditional Kalman filter (KF) and particle filter;  the MVU FIR filter exhibits better immunity to the errors about a priori knowledge of noise variances. It can handle the kidnapped problem;  and recover from some extreme failures satisfactorily. Moreover;  the MVU FIR filtering algorithm is fast and easily implementable. Its online computational time is even lower than that of the KF;  which is favorable in localization applications.
