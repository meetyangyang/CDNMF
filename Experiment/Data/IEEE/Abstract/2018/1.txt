A fundamental requirement of the supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete-event systems is a finite automaton model of the plant. The requirement does not hold for black-box systems whose source code and logical model are not accessible. To apply SCT to black-box systems;  we integrate automaton learning technology with SCT and apply the new method to improve the requirements conformance of software reuse. If the reused software component does not satisfy a requirement;  the method adds a supervisor component to prevent the black-box system from reaching “faulty sections.” The method employs learning-based testing (LBT) to verify whether the reused software meets all requirements in the new context. LBT generates a large number of test cases and iteratively constructs an automaton model of the system under test. If the system fails the test;  the learned model is applied as the plant model for control synthesis using SCT. Then;  the supervisor is implemented as an executable program to monitor and control the system to follow the requirement. Finally;  the integrated system;  including the supervisory program and the reused component;  is tested by LBT to assure the satisfiability of the requirement. This paper makes two contributions. First;  we innovatively integrate LBT and SCT for the control synthesis of black-box reactive systems. Second;  software component reuse is still possible even if it does not satisfy user requirements at the outset.
