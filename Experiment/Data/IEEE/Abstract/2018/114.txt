This brief investigates the performance of an automated robotic system;  which uses a combination of vision and force sensing to remove screws from the back of laptops. This robotic system uses two webcams;  one that is fixed over the robot and the other mounted on the robot;  as well as a sensorequipped (SE) screwdriver. Experimental studies were conducted to test the performance of the SE screwdriver and vision system. The parameters that were varied included the internal brightness settings on the webcams;  the method in which the workspace was illuminated;  and color of the laptop case. A localized light source and higher brightness setting as the laptop's case became darker produced the best results. In this brief;  the SE screwdriver was able to successfully remove 96.5% of the screws.
