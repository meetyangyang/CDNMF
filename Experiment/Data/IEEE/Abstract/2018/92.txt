It has been established that the transfer of human adaptive impedance is of great significance for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). By processing the electromyography (EMG) signals collected from human muscles;  the limb impedance could be extracted and transferred to robots. The existing impedance transfer interfaces rely only on visual feedback and;  thus;  may be insufficient for skill transfer in a sophisticated environment. In this paper;  physical haptic feedback mechanism is introduced to result in muscle activity that would generate EMG signals in a natural manner;  in order to achieve intuitive human impedance transfer through a designed coupling interface. Relevant processing methods are integrated into the system;  including the spectral collaborative representation-based classifications method used for hand motion recognition; fast smooth envelop and dimensionality reduction algorithm for arm endpoint stiffness estimation. The tutor's arm endpoint motion trajectory is directly transferred to the robot by the designed coupling module without the restriction of hands. Haptic feedback is provided to the human tutor according to skill learning performance to enhance the teaching experience. The interface has been experimentally tested by a plugging-in task and a cutting task. Compared with the existing interfaces;  the developed one has shown a better performance.
