Noncontact assessment of heart rate (HR) in Zebrafish larvae;  based on a video record of the organism;  acquired using a camera mounted on a microscope;  has gained enormous significance. Completely automatic and robust estimation of HR from videos of non-transgenic larvae requires the determination of an appropriate region of interest (ROI);  followed by suitable signal processing steps. Toward such a goal;  we develop a fully automatic and adaptive ROI enclosing a predominant portion of the beating heart;  irrespective of the image resolution and zoom. The information within the ROI is used to get one or more time series;  to be processed for extracting the signal containing information about the beating heart. Among the various possibilities;  we show that the multichannel approach exploiting color information and based on independent component analysis to extract the cardiac signal-is desirable;  due to several reasons;  including its ability to handle noise;  minor movements of the larvae or of the platform;  and statistical performance. The proposed sequence of algorithms is validated on videos of 41 larvae (2 days and 4 days postfertilization). The computer estimated values of HR compared well with the ground truth obtained by visual-counting. We have also devised a method of tracking the ROI associated with drifting larvae and tested it on real data. In addition;  an example of handling a type of arrhythmia is given.
