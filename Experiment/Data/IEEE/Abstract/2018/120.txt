In this paper;  the performance of a typical composite work cell structure that includes multiple machines and a material handling gantry is studied. A mathematic model is established to analyze the performance of such gantry systems. Due to the unique features of the gantry system;  cycle time and waiting time of the gantry and machines are discussed and formulated based on two basic scenarios. To measure the impact of disruption events;  permanent production loss is evaluated by using the sensor data collected from plant floors. Data-driven diagnostic methods are developed to identify the bottleneck machine and to evaluate permanent production loss attribution of each machine. The results provide a solid base to efficiently and effectively improve the performance of a composite work system. Performance diagnostics of gantry systems provides a theoretical and practical basis for production improvement. A gantry system for composite lay-up processes is used for numerical simulation case studies;  by which the performance diagnostic methodologies and improvements are demonstrated.
