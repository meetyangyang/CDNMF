In practical applications;  industrial cranes may exhibit double-pendulum swing effects;  due to many factors;  such as large payload scales and non-negligible hook masses. Currently;  for double-pendulum cranes;  most available methods are open-loop controllers designed based on linearized crane dynamics; even for existing closed-loop approaches;  they are also mostly developed using linearized dynamics and require the exact knowledge of system parameters;  which makes them sensitive to parametric uncertainties. To handle these issues;  we present an adaptive antiswing control strategy for crane systems with double-pendulum swing effects and uncertain/unknown parameters;  which can make the trolley accurately reach the target position with reduced overshoots and effectively eliminate the double-pendulum swing angles at the same time. A complete stability analysis;  based upon the full nonlinear dynamics (i.e.;  without linearizing the dynamics);  is included to support the theoretical derivations. We present hardware experimental results to demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves better performance than existing ones and exhibits good robustness.
