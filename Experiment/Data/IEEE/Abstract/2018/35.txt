Posture analysis in quiet standing is an essential element in evaluating human balance control. Many factors enhance the human control system's ability to maintain stability;  such as the visual system and base of support (feet) placement. In contrast;  many neural pathologies;  such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and cerebellar disorder;  disturb human stability. This paper addresses the problem of the automatic segmentation of stabilometric signals recorded under four different conditions related to vision and foot position. This is achieved for both control subjects and PD subjects. A hidden Markov model (HMM)regression-based approach is used to carry out the segmentation between the different conditions using simple and multiple regression processes. Twenty-eight control subjects and thirty-two PD subjects participated in this study. They were asked to stand upright while recording stabilometric signals in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions under two permutations: feet apart and together with eyes open or closed. The results show high values for the correct segmentation rates;  up to 98%;  for the separation between the different conditions. The present findings could help clinicians better understand the motor strategies used by the patients during their orthostatic postures and may guide the rehabilitation process. The proposed method compares favorably with standard segmentation approaches.
