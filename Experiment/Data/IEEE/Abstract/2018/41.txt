In this paper;  an active control approach using two piezoelectric actuators (PZTAs) and an adaptive controller is investigated for suppressing the two-DOF regenerative chatter in micromilling. The PZTAs are utilized as active control elements to provide force compensation for chatter suppression. First;  the dynamical model of micromilling process is demonstrated. Then;  an adaptive controller is developed by employing neural networks to approximate the unknown dynamics of the cutting system and the unknown bounding functions related to the time-delayed tool vibrations;  and applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional to aid in treating the time-delayed effect of the regenerative mechanism of chatter. By employing the developed control approach;  the tool vibrations in two directions vertical to each other are successfully suppressed. Finally;  simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the developed control approach.
