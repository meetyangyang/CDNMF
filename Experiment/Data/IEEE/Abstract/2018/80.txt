This paper develops a structural diagnosis approach for fault detection and isolation in hybrid systems. Hybrid systems are characterized by continuous behaviors that are interspersed with discrete mode changes in the system;  making the analysis of behaviors quite complex. In this paper;  we address the mode detection problem in hybrid systems as the first step in diagnoser design. The proposed method uses analytic redundancy methods to detect the operating mode of the system even in the presence of system faults. We define hybrid minimal structurally overdetermined (HMSO) sets for hybrid systems. For residual generation;  we develop the HMSO selection problem;  formulated as a binary integer linear programming optimization problem to minimize the number of selected HMSOs and reduce online computational costs of the diagnosis algorithm. The proposed structural approach does not require preenumeration of all possible modes in the diagnoser design step. Therefore;  our approach is feasible for hybrid systems with a large number of switching elements;  implying that the system can have a large number of operating modes. The case study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. We discuss the results of our case study;  and present directions for future work.
