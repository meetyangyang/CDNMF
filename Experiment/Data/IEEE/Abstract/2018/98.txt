This paper provides revisions to the algorithms presented by Chen et al.;  2013 for testing diagnosability of stochastic discrete-event systems. Additional new contributions include PSPACE-hardness of verifying strong stochastic diagnosability (referred as A-Diagnosability in Thorsley et al.;  2005) and a necessary and sufficient condition for testing stochastic diagnosability (referred as AA-Diagnosability in Thorsley et al.;  2005) that involves a new notion of probabilistic equivalence.
