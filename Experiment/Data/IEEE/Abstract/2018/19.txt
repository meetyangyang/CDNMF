In this paper;  we present a novel high-throughput anti-collision algorithm for passive ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Our algorithm utilizes signal recovery techniques of collided tag signals to both recover tag communications and obtain an accurate count of all tags in the field. Passive UHF RFID systems are used for long-range passive communications for applications including supply chain management and electronic tolling. Anti-collision algorithms are used to ensure successful RFID tag communications due to the likelihood of multiple tags being in the field and attempting to communicate simultaneously. The limited on-tag functionality necessitates the use of simple anti-collision algorithms such as a dynamic frame slotted Aloha (DFSA) algorithm. With our novel collision detection and signal recovery anti-collision algorithm;  the RFID reader can retrieve multiple valid communications from each collided slot in a DFSA-based anti-collision protocol;  while our algorithm allocates an optimal number of slots resulting in more collided but recoverable slots and fewer empty slots. Our algorithm achieves a nearly 100% throughput improvement with an expected throughput of 0.85 compared with an expected throughput of 0.426 for a standard DFSA algorithm. The reader receiver with the proposed algorithm is implemented in a field-programmable gate array and the whole reader system is verified using the communication tests with commercial tags.
