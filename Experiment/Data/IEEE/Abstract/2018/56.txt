We propose a learning-based approach for automatic detection of fabric defects. Our approach is based on a statistical representation of fabric patterns using the redundant contourlet transform (RCT). The distribution of the RCT coefficients are modeled using a finite mixture of generalized Gaussians (MoGG);  which constitute statistical signatures distinguishing between defective and defect-free fabrics. In addition to being compact and fast to compute;  these signatures enable accurate localization of defects. Our defect detection system is based on three main steps. In the first step;  a preprocessing is applied for detecting basic pattern size for image decomposition and signature calculation. In the second step;  labeled fabric samples are used to train a Bayes classifier (BC) to discriminate between defect-free and defective fabrics. Finally;  defects are detected during image inspection by testing local patches using the learned BC. Our approach can deal with multiple types of textile fabrics;  from simple to more complex ones. Experiments on the TILDA database have demonstrated that our method yields better results compared with recent state-of-the-art methods.
