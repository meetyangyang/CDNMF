Modeling and analysis of profiles;  especially high-dimensional nonlinear profiles;  is an important and challenging topic in statistical process control. Conventional mixed-effects models have several limitations in solving the multichannel profile detection problems for in-line Raman spectroscopy;  such as the inability to separate defective information from random effects;  computational inefficiency;  and inability to handle high-dimensional extracted coefficients. In this paper;  a new wavelet-based penalized mixed-effects decomposition (PMD) method is proposed to solve the multichannel profile detection problem in Raman spectroscopy. The proposed PMD exploits a regularized high-dimensional regression with linear constraints to decompose the profiles into four parts: fixed effects;  normal effects;  defective effects;  and signal-dependent noise. An optimization algorithm based on the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is developed to do parameter estimation efficiently for the proposed model. Finally;  the separated fixed effects coefficients;  normal effects coefficients;  and defective effects coefficients can be used to extract the quality features of fabrication consistency;  with in sample uniformity;  and defect information;  respectively. Using a surrogated data analysis and a case study;  we evaluated the performance of the proposed PMD method and demonstrated a better detection power with less computational time.
