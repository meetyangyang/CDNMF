Accurate digital maps play a crucial role in various location-based services and applications. However;  store information is usually missing or outdated in current maps. In this paper;  we propose CrowdGIS;  an automatic store selfupdating system for digital maps that leverages street views and sensing data crowdsourced from mobile users. We first develop a new weighted artificial neural network to learn the underlying relationship between estimated positions and real positions to localize user's shooting positions. Then;  a novel text detection method is designed by considering two valuable features;  including the color and texture information of letters. In this way;  we can recognize complete store name instead of individual letters as in the previous study. Furthermore;  we transfer the shooting position to the location of recognized stores in the map. Finally;  CrowdGIS considers three updating categories (replacing;  adding;  and deleting) to update changed stores in the map based on the kernel density estimate model. We implement CrowdGIS and conduct extensive experiments in a real outdoor region for 1 month. The evaluation results demonstrate that CrowdGIS effectively accommodates store variations and updates stores to maintain an up-to-date map with high accuracy.
