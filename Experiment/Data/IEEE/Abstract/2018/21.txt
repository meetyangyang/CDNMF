In this paper;  we define a novel census signal temporal logic (CensusSTL) that focuses on the number of agents in different subsets of a group that complete a certain task specified by the STL. CensusSTL consists of an “inner logic” STL formula and an “outer logic” STL formula. We present a new inference algorithm to infer CensusSTL formulas from the trajectory data of a group of agents. We first identify the “inner logic” STL formula and then infer the subgroups based on whether the agents' behaviors satisfy the “inner logic” formula at each time point. We use two different approaches to infer the subgroups based on similarity and complementarity;  respectively. The “outer logic” CensusSTL formula is inferred from the census trajectories of different subgroups. We apply the algorithm in analyzing data from a soccer match by inferring the CensusSTL formula for different subgroups of a soccer team.
