Bayesian network (BN) has been a popular tool for gaining mechanistic understanding of variables by revealing how the variables influence each other. It has been found very effective in a few studies in quality control and process monitoring. However;  for complex problems where the structure of a BN is unknown;  a common approach is to learn the BN structure from observational data. A fundamental bottleneck of this approach is that observational data can only be used to discover part of the influential relationships among variables. To overcome this problem;  we propose to combine observational data and expert knowledge. To the best of the author's knowledge;  our approach is the first of its kind that formulates an experimental design framework to automate the expert elicitation process and collect the most informative expert knowledge;  optimally matched to the observational data;  to learn the BN structure.
