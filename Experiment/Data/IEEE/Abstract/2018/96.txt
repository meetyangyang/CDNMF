An autonomous framework to evaluate layout of a piping design in the form of piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) according to a set of standards of marine and offshore industry is proposed. The method starts with transforming a P&ID into a vector x in Rd. Transformation is done based on a concept introduced for piping known as Histogram of Connectivity. The proposed descriptor captures two essential properties of P&ID: attributes of each component and connectivity among the components. Next;  linear support vector machine (SVM) is used to learn a classifier from existing compliant and noncompliant designs. Subsequently;  the linear classifier can be used to check if an unseen design complies with the standards. In addition;  to enable follow up on noncompliant design including correction or modification;  a method to analyze the reason of noncompliance prediction by the learned SVM model is introduced. The method has demonstrated encouraging performance in two challenging data sets of designs created with advice from experienced engineers in the industry;  based on International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and Rules for Classification of Ships of Lloyd's Register.
