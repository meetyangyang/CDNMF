This paper presents the design of a novel flexure-based precision positioning stage with constant output force for biological cell micromanipulation. One uniqueness of the proposed design is that it produces a constant force without using a force controller. Only a motion control is needed to produce a constant output force;  which significantly simplifies the system design process. The stage is driven by a piezoelectric actuator through a displacement amplifier. Analytical models of the displacement amplifier and the zero-stiffness structure are established and verified by conducting finite-element analysis simulations. The structure parameters are optimally designed to guarantee the requirement on output force;  motion range;  and physical size. A prototype stage is fabricated by 3-D printing process and a series of experiments is carried out. Experimental results show that the developed positioning stage delivers a near constant output force with slight fluctuation in the reachable constant-force motion range of 138 Î¼m. The applications of the developed constant-force stage in biological cell manipulation have been demonstrated through experimental investigations.
