Local modular control (LMC) is an approach to the supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete-event systems that exploits the modularity of plant and specifications. Recently;  distinguishers and approximations have been associated with SCT to simplify modeling and reduce synthesis effort. This paper shows how advantages from LMC;  distinguishers;  and approximations can be combined. Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee that local supervisors computed by our approach lead to the same global closed-loop behavior as the solution obtained with the original LMC;  in which the modeling is entirely handled without distinguishers. A further contribution presents a modular way to design distinguishers and a straightforward way to construct approximations to be used in local synthesis. An example of manufacturing system illustrates our approach.
