Robotic manipulation of deformable objects is a difficult problem especially because of the complexity of the many different ways an object can deform. Searching such a high-dimensional state space makes it difficult to recognize;  track;  and manipulate deformable objects. In this paper;  we introduce a predictive;  model-driven approach to address this challenge;  using a precomputed;  simulated database of deformable object models. Mesh models of common deformable garments are simulated with the garments picked up in multiple different poses under gravity;  and stored in a database for fast and efficient retrieval. To validate this approach;  we developed a comprehensive pipeline for manipulating clothing as in a typical laundry task. First;  the database is used for category and the pose estimation is used for a garment in an arbitrary position. A fully featured 3-D model of the garment is constructed in real time;  and volumetric features are then used to obtain the most similar model in the database to predict the object category and pose. Second;  the database can significantly benefit the manipulation of deformable objects via nonrigid registration;  providing accurate correspondences between the reconstructed object model and the database models. Third;  the accurate model simulation can also be used to optimize the trajectories for the manipulation of deformable objects;  such as the folding of garments. Extensive experimental results are shown for the above tasks using a variety of different clothings.
