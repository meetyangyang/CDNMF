Planning motions for two robot arms to move an object collaboratively is a difficult problem;  mainly because of the closed-chain constraint;  which arises whenever two robot hands simultaneously grasp a single rigid object. In this paper;  we propose a manipulation planning algorithm to bring an object from an initial stable placement (position and orientation of the object on a support surface) toward a goal stable placement. The key specificity of our algorithm is that it is certified-complete: for a given object and a given environment;  we provide a certificate that the algorithm will find a solution to any bimanual manipulation query in that environment whenever one exists. Moreover;  the certificate is constructive: at run-time;  it can be used to quickly find a solution to a given query. The algorithm is tested in software and hardware on a number of large pieces of furniture.
