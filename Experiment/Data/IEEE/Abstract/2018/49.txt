This paper presents a novel approach to kinematic redundancy resolution for redundant robots;  which have more degrees of freedom than workspace dimensions. It introduces the concept of a global redundancy resolution;  which has the convenient property that whenever the robot returns to the same workspace point;  it uses the same joint-space pose. The problem is cast;  as a continuous pseudoinversion of the forward kinematic map. Continuity and smoothness should be attained if possible;  but otherwise the volume of the discontinuity boundary should be minimized. A sampling-based approximation technique is presented that constructs roadmaps of both the domain and image;  and minimizes discontinuities of the inverse function using a maximum satisfiability problem. Applications of this map include teleoperation;  dimensionality reduction in motion planning;  and workspace visualization. Results are demonstrated on toy problems with up to 20 DOF and on several robot arms.
