This paper addresses the problem of discovering a Petri Net (PN) from a long event sequence representing the behavior of discrete-event processes. A method for building a 1-bounded PN able to execute the events sequence S is presented; it is based on determining causality and concurrence relations between events and computing the t-invariants. This novel method determines the structure and the initial marking of an ordinary PN;  which reproduces the behavior in S. The algorithms derived from the method are efficient and have been implemented and tested on numerous examples of diverse complexity.
