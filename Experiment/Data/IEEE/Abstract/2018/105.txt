When a single service on its own cannot fulfill a sophisticated application;  a composition of services is required. Existing methods mostly use a fixed-price scheme for service pricing and determine service allocation for composition based on a first-price auction. However;  in a dynamic service market;  it is difficult for service providers to determine a fixed price that is profitable while attractive to customers. Meanwhile;  this mechanism cannot ensure that the providers who require the least cost to provide services would win the auction;  because the pricing strategy of service providers is unpredictable. To address such issues;  in this paper;  we propose Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction-based dynamic pricing for a generalized service composition. We consider fine-grained services as candidates for composition as well as coarse-grained ones. In our approach;  service providers bid for services of different granularities in the composite service and based on received bids;  a user decides a composition that minimizes the social cost while meeting quality constraints. Experimental results at last verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
