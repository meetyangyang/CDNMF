Cluster tools are automated robotic manufacturing systems containing multiple computer-controlled process modules. They have been increasingly used for wafer fabrication. This paper reviews the modeling and scheduling methods for cluster tools with both nonrevisiting and revisiting processes. For nonrevisiting processes;  we focus on the modeling and scheduling problems of cluster tools with different constraints. Then;  their solution methods are reviewed and compared. For revisiting processes;  this paper first discusses the scheduling problem of some general manufacturing systems with revisiting. Then;  the modeling and scheduling methodologies used to solve the scheduling problems of cluster tools with revisiting processes are reviewed. Future research directions and conclusions are finally discussed.
