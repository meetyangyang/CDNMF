The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in the field of maintenance. For this purpose;  the robot system must be able to plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths. Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In this paper;  an approach is presented;  which is especially suited to solve the problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose;  offline data from CAD is combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic filter;  to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the different tasks;  a method is explained;  which uses a symbolic description;  founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For path planning;  we use global state-of-the-art algorithms with a method that allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.
