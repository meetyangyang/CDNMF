This paper presents planning and control synthesis for multiple aerial manipulators to transport a common object. Each aerial manipulator that consists of a hexacopter and a two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm is controlled by an augmented adaptive sliding mode controller based on a closed-chain robot dynamics. We propose a motion planning algorithm by exploiting rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*) and dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). The desired path for each aerial manipulator is obtained by using RRT* with Bezier curve;  which is designed to handle environmental obstacles;  such as buildings or equipments. During aerial transportation;  to avoid unknown obstacle;  DMPs modify the trajectory based on the virtual leader- follower structure. By the combination of RRT* and DMPs;  the cooperative aerial manipulators can carry a common object to keep reducing the interaction force between multiple robots while avoiding an obstacle in the unstructured environment. To validate the proposed planning and control synthesis;  two experiments with multiple custom-made aerial manipulators are presented;  which involve user-guided trajectory and RRT*-planned trajectory tracking in unstructured environments.
