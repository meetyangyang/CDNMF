In a 3-D scanning task;  a robot-sensor system controls a robotic arm to move a laser sensor. In order to align the coordinate system of the robotic arm and laser sensor;  prior calibration is required to derive the transformation between both coordinate systems. This paper proposes a new calibration method in three steps: manual data collection;  sensing data calculation;  and transformation solution. First;  at least four data are required to be collected by the user. The sensing data are then calculated from the collected data and adopted to provide the desired transformation. The proposed algorithm has two features: arbitrary placement of planar disk and noise tolerant. Using a planar disk;  the algorithm will automatically derive the angular relationship between the disk and the sensor plane;  enabling arbitrary orientation placement. Noise tolerant is guaranteed by fitting ellipses during the sensing data calculation and using a single set of sensing data in transformation solution. Experiments and comparisons are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed calibration algorithm.
