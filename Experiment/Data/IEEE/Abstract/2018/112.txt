This brief develops a degradation-based imperfect maintenance policy considering both positive effect and negative effect for a deteriorating system with variations of operating conditions. The proposed method improves the positive effect on the imperfect maintenance;  which further considers the impact of resource on the distribution function of the positive effect after each maintenance process. The positive effect induces the system state into a random interval which is related to maintenance resource applied into each preventive maintenance action and actual maintenance times. Meanwhile;  a new negative deteriorating effect model for describing the impacts of imperfect maintenance actions is established. The new model considers that the degradation rate increases after each imperfect maintenance process; meanwhile;  it includes the impacts of variations of operating condition bringing to the degradation rate which is described as a distribution subjected to stress as well. Therefore;  a condition-based adaptive maintenance policy is applied for a deteriorating system. The optimal maintenance cost allocation and maintenance threshold are determined by maximizing an availability function. Finally;  a numerical example is illustrated to demonstrate the application of our maintenance model and policy.
