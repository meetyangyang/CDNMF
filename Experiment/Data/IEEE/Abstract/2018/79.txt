Sensor-based online process monitoring has extensive applications;  such as in manufacturing and service industries. In real environments;  though;  sensor data are often contaminated with noise;  leading to severe challenges in accurate data analysis. In the existing literature;  noise is generally modeled as Gaussian to analyze sensor data for various applications;  for example in fault detection and diagnostics. However;  in some applications;  such as due to challenging field conditions;  sensor data may be disturbed by high levels of outliers such that the Gaussian assumption of sensor noise is inadequate;  thus leading to large estimation errors. This paper focuses on online classification applications. A robust sparse representation classification method is proposed;  which considers non-Gaussian noise;  and thus can effectively analyze sensor data with higher levels of outliers. Case studies were completed;  based on both numerically simulated sensor data and actual wearable sensor data from occupational manual material handling process monitoring. The proposed classification method could effectively analyze sensor data with non-Gaussian noise;  and outperformed commonly used methods in the literature. Thus;  this new method may be advantageous for solving classification problems in challenging field conditions;  to address the difficulties of high levels of sensor outliers.
