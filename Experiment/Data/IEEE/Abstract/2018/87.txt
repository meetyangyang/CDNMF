Scheduling of multicluster tools has received much attention due to its complexity of interaction among cluster tools. A cluster tool comprises several modules such as processing modules;  a transfer module with a single or dual-armed handling robot;  and loadlock modules. A multicluster tool comprises two;  three;  or more cluster tools that are interconnected with each other. In this paper;  we propose a deadlock prevention policy for noncyclic scheduling of dual-armed multicluster tools. The proposed deadlock prevention policy is effective for generating an efficient schedule for two or three-connected multicluster tools with a single or a dual-path flow. This is proven by analyzing the strict minimal siphon of the Petri net model. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of a maximal permissible deadlock prevention policy. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally efficient for larger state spaces and more suitable than conventional deadlock prevention policies for generating effective schedules for noncyclic scheduling of multicluster tools.
