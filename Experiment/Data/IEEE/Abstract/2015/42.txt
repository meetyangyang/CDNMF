This work addresses the problem of localizing a ground target observed by multiple heterogeneous unmanned vehicles. Specifically;  the case of a team of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles is analyzed. Effective collaboration between unmanned aerial and ground vehicles can utilize the strengths of both platforms while mediating their individual weaknesses. In this research;  a probabilistic framework is proposed to improve target localization accuracy by utilizing the epipolar geometry and inter-robot localization measurements. A virtual simulation environment is implemented to fully test the proposed methods. Hardware experiments are carried out to validate the proposed methods.
