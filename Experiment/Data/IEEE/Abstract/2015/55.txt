This paper addresses the problem of time-coordination of a team of cooperating multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles that exchange information over a supporting time-varying network. A distributed control law is developed to ensure that the vehicles meet the desired temporal assignments of the mission;  while flying along predefined collision-free paths;  even in the presence of faulty communication networks;  temporary link losses;  and switching topologies. In this paper;  the coordination task is solved by reaching consensus on a suitably defined coordination state. Conditions are derived under which the coordination errors converge to a neighborhood of zero. Simulation and flight test results are presented to validate the theoretical findings.
