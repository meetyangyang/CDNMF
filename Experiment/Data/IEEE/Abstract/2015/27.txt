This paper considers grasp planning in the presence of shape uncertainty and explores how cloud computing can facilitate parallel Monte Carlo sampling of combination actions and shape perturbations to estimate a lower bound on the probability of achieving force closure. We focus on parallel-jaw push grasping for the class of parts that can be modeled as extruded 2-D polygons with statistical tolerancing. We describe an extension to model part slip and experimental results with an adaptive sampling algorithm that can reduce sample size by 90%. We show how the algorithm can also bound part tolerance for a given grasp quality level and report a sensitivity analysis on algorithm parameters. We test a cloud-based implementation with varying numbers of nodes;  obtaining a 515 Ã— speedup with 500 nodes in one case;  suggesting the algorithm can scale linearly when all nodes are reliable.
