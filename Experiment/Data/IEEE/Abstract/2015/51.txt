This paper considers multirobot task allocation problems where the estimated costs for performing tasks are interrelated;  and the overall team objective need not be a standard sum-of-costs (or utilities) model;  enabling straightforward treatment of the additional costs incurred by resource contention. In the model we introduce;  a team may choose one of a set of shared resources to perform a task (e.g.;  several routes to reach a destination);  and interference is modeled when multiple robots use the same resource. We show that the general problem is NP-hard;  and investigate specialized subinstances with particular cost structures. For the general problem;  we describe an exact algorithm which finds an optimal assignment in a reasonable time on small instances. Aiming at larger problems;  we turn two particular subinstances;  introducing an two algorithms that find assignments quickly even for problems of considerable size;  the first being optimal;  the second being an approximation algorithm but also producing high-quality solutions with bounded suboptimality.
