Improving the efficacy of rapid response operations in acute care delivery to ensure patient safety and care quality is of significant importance. In this paper;  we study the response time performance (RTP) in rapid response operations. Such performance is defined as the probability that an appropriate decision responding to patient deterioration can be made within a desired time period. First;  we derive a closed formula to evaluate the RTP by assuming exponential response time;  and investigate the system-theoretic properties. Next;  we introduce a bottleneck indicator to identify the response whose improvement will lead to the largest improvement in RTP. Then;  we extend the study to non-exponential response time scenario. An approximation formula is proposed to evaluate RTP. Finally;  a case study at the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital is introduced to illustrate the applicability of the method.
