Buildings with shared spaces such as corporate office buildings;  university dorms;  etc.;  are occupied by multiple occupants who typically have different temperature preferences. Attaining a common temperature set-point that is agreeable to all users (occupants) in such a multi-occupant space is a challenging problem. Furthermore;  the ideal temperature set-point should optimally trade off the building energy cost with the aggregate discomfort of all the occupants. However;  the information on the comfort range (function) is held privately by each occupant. Using occupant-differentiated dynamically-adjusted penalty factor as feedback signals;  we propose a distributed solution which ensures that a consensus is attained among all occupants upon convergence;  irrespective of their ideal temperature preferences being in coherence or conflicting. Occupants are only assumed to be rational;  in that they choose their own temperature set-points so as to minimize their individual energy cost plus discomfort. We establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm to the optimal temperature set-point vector that minimizes the sum of the energy cost and the aggregate discomfort of all occupants in a multizone building. Simulations with realistic parameter settings illustrate validation of our theoretical claims and provide insights on the dynamics of the system with a mobile user population.
