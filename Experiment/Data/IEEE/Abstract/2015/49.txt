The task of locating a source based on the measurements of the signal emitted/emanating from it is called the source-seeking problem. In the past few years;  there has been a lot of interest in deploying autonomous platforms for source-seeking. Some of the challenging issues with implementing autonomous source-seeking are the lack of a priori knowledge about the distribution of the emitted signal and presence of noise in both the environment and on-board sensor measurements. This paper proposes a planner for a swarm of robots engaged in seeking an electromagnetic source. The navigation strategy for the planner is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is a population-based stochastic optimization technique. An equivalence is established between particles generated in the traditional PSO technique;  and the mobile agents in the swarm. Since the positions of the robots are updated using the PSO algorithm;  modifications are required to implement the PSO algorithm on real robots to incorporate collision avoidance strategies. The modifications necessary to implement PSO on mobile robots;  and strategies to adapt to real environments are presented in this paper. Our results are also validated on an experimental testbed.
