In this paper;  a novel backtracking scheme is investigated to shorten the time of the attitude determination-based initial alignment. Based on the investigated backtracking scheme;  the recorded data during the forward process is reversed and connected with the forward data;  which is further used to construct the vector observations for the attitude determination based initial alignment. The investigated method can improve the accuracy and robustness of the initial alignment within only a very short period of time. The car-mounted experiment demonstrates the validity of the investigated method.
