In this paper;  we propose new memetic algorithms (MAs) for the multiobjective flexible job shop scheduling problem (MO-FJSP) with the objectives to minimize the makespan;  total workload;  and critical workload. The problem is addressed in a Pareto manner;  which aims to search for a set of Pareto optimal solutions. First;  by using well-designed chromosome encoding/decoding scheme and genetic operators;  the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is adapted for the MO-FJSP. Then;  our MAs are developed by incorporating a novel local search algorithm into the adapted NSGA-II;  where some good individuals are chosen from the offspring population for local search using a selection mechanism. Furthermore;  in the proposed local search;  a hierarchical strategy is adopted to handle the three objectives;  which mainly considers the minimization of makespan;  while the concern of the other two objectives is reflected in the order of trying all the possible actions that could generate the acceptable neighbor. In the experimental studies;  the influence of two alternative acceptance rules on the performance of the proposed MAs is first examined. Afterwards;  the effectiveness of key components in our MAs is verified;  including genetic search;  local search;  and the hierarchical strategy in local search. Finally;  extensive comparisons are carried out with the state-of-the-art methods specially presented for the MO-FJSP on well-known benchmark instances. The results show that the proposed MAs perform much better than all the other algorithms.
