The steelmaking-continuous-casting (SCC) process;  which includes steelmaking;  refining and continuous casting;  is one of the major bottlenecks of iron and steel production. Efficient and effective scheduling of this process is essential to improve the productivity and reduce the production costs of the entire production system. We present a time-index formulation for this scheduling problem and a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) approach based on the relaxation of the machine capacity constraints. The relaxed problem is solved using an efficient polynomial dynamic programming algorithm. The corresponding Lagrangian dual (LD) problem is solved using a deflected conditional subgradient level method. Unlike the conventional subgradient algorithms for the LD problem;  our method guarantees convergence using the Brannlund's level control strategy to replace the strict convergence condition that the optimum of the dual problem is known a priori. Furthermore;  our method enhances the efficiency by introducing a deflected conditional subgradient to weaken the zigzagging phenomena that slows the convergence of conventional subgradient algorithms. The computational results demonstrate that the approaches can quickly obtain high-quality solutions and are notably promising for the SCC scheduling.
