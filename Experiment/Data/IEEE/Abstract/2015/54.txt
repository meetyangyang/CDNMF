This paper considers the fusion of carrier-phase differential GPS (CP-DGPS);  peer-to-peer ranging radios;  and low-cost inertial navigation systems (INS) for the application of relative navigation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in close formation-flight. A novel sensor fusion algorithm is presented that incorporates locally processed tightly coupled GPS/INS-based absolute navigation solutions from each UAV in a relative navigation filter that estimates the baseline separation using integer-fixed relative CP-DGPS and a set of peer-to-peer ranging radios. The robustness of the dynamic baseline estimation performance under conditions that are typically challenging for CP-DGPS alone;  such as a high occurrence of phase breaks;  poor satellite visibility/geometry due to extreme UAV attitude;  and heightened multipath intensity;  amongst others;  is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation trials. The simulation environment developed for this work combines a UAV formation flight control simulator with a GPS constellation simulator;  stochastic models of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor errors;  and measurement noise of the ranging radios. The sensor fusion is shown to offer improved robustness for 3-D relative positioning in terms of 3-D residual sum of squares (RSS) accuracy and increased percentage of correctly fixed phase ambiguities. Moreover;  baseline estimation performance is significantly improved during periods in which differential carrier phase ambiguities are unsuccessfully fixed.
