Metrology;  the theoretical and practical study of measurement;  has applications in automated manufacturing;  inspection;  robotics;  surveying;  and healthcare. The geometric probing problem considers how to optimally use a probe to measure geometric properties. In this paper;  we consider a proximity probe which;  given a point;  returns the distance to the boundary of the nearest object. When there is an unknown convex polygon P in the plane;  the goal is to minimize the number of probe measurement needed to exactly determine the shape and location of P. We present an algorithm with upper bound of 3.5n + k + 2 probes;  where n is the number of vertices and k ≤ 3 is the number of acute angles of P. The algorithm requires constant time per probe;  and hence;  O(n) time to determine P. We also address the related problem where the unknown polygon is a member of a known finite set Γ and the goal is to efficiently determine which polygon is present. When m is the size of Γ and n' is the maximum number of vertices of any member of Γ;  we present an algorithm with an upper bound of 2n + 2 probes with O(1) computations per probe and a O(n'm) preprocessing phase (depending only on Γ).
