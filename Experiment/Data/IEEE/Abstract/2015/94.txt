Semiconductor cluster tools are the integrated equipment to process a variety of silicon wafers for the fabrication of microelectronic components. The cluster tool system consists of several loadlock modules;  processing chambers;  and material handling armed robots for transferring wafers between them. Most scheduling problems for dual-armed cluster tools adopt cyclic scheduling with the assumption of swap sequence of the robot arm. A deadlock-free and non-cyclic scheduling is highly required to improve total throughput of cluster tools for various types of wafer flow patterns and various changes of equipment configurations. In this paper;  we propose a Petri net decomposition approach to derive a near-optimal solution of deadlock-free and non-cyclic scheduling of dual-armed cluster tools to reduce the computational complexity. A timed Petri net model is introduced to represent a non-cyclic scheduling model for dual-armed cluster tools. In order to obtain a deadlock-free and non-cyclic schedule efficiently;  we propose a deadlock avoidance control policy that restricts the markings to prevent unmarked siphons. Deadlock condition for the dual-armed cluster tools is characterized by the structure of Petri net model. The performance of the non-cyclic scheduling model by the proposed method is compared with that of the cyclic scheduling model. Computational results show the effectiveness of the non-cyclic scheduling model compared with the cyclic scheduling model for multiple wafer flow patterns.
