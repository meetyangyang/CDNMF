This paper investigates the cooperative control problem of uncertain high-order nonlinear multi-agent systems on directed graph with a fixed topology. Each follower is assumed to have an unknown controlling effect which depends on its own state. By the Nussbaum-type gain technique and the function approximation capability of neural networks;  a distributed adaptive neural networks-based controller is designed for each follower in the graph such that all followers can asymptotically synchronize the leader with tracking errors being semi-globally uniform ultimate bounded. Analysis of stability and parameter convergence of the proposed algorithm are conducted based on algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov theory. Finally;  a example is provided to validate the theoretical results.
