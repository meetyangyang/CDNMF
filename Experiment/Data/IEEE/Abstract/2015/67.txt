In this paper;  a machine learning (ML) approach is presented that exploits accelerometers data to deal with gesture recognition (GR) problems. The proposed methodology aims at providing high accuracy classification for home automation systems;  which are generally user independent;  device independent;  and device orientation independent;  an heterogeneous scenario that has not been fully investigated in previous GR literature. The approach illustrated in this paper is composed of three main steps: event identification; feature extraction; and ML-based classification. The elements of the novelty of the proposed approach are 1) a preprocessing phase based on principal component analysis to increase the performance in real-world scenario conditions and 2) the development of parsimonious novel classification techniques based on sparse Bayesian learning. This methodology is tested on two datasets of four gesture classes (horizontal;  vertical;  circles;  and eight-shaped movements) and on a further dataset with eight classes. In order to authentically describe a real-world home automation environment;  the gesture movements are collected from more than 30 people who freely perform any gesture. It results in a dictionary of 12 and 20 different movements;  respectively;  in the case of the four-class and the eight-class databases.
