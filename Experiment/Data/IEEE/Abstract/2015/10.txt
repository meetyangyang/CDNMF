Traditional approaches for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis are apt to using multiple channels of physiological signals to detect apnea events by dividing the signals into equal-length segments;  which may lead to incorrect apnea event detection and weaken the performance of OSA diagnosis. This paper proposes an automatic-segmentation-based screening approach with the single channel of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for OSA subject diagnosis;  and the main work of the proposed approach lies in three aspects: (i) an automatic signal segmentation algorithm is adopted for signal segmentation instead of the equal-length segmentation rule; (ii) a local median filter is improved for reduction of the unexpected RR intervals before signal segmentation; (iii) the designed OSA severity index and additional admission information of OSA suspects are plugged into support vector machine (SVM) for OSA subject diagnosis. A real clinical example from PhysioNet database is provided to validate the proposed approach and an average accuracy of 97.41% for subject diagnosis is obtained which demonstrates the effectiveness for OSA diagnosis.
