In semiconductor manufacturing;  metrology operations are expensive and time-consuming;  for this reason only a certain sample of wafers is measured. With the need of highly reliable processes;  the semiconductor industry aims at developing methodologies covering the gap of missing metrology information. Virtual Metrology turns out to be a promising method; it aims at predicting wafer and/or site fine metrology results in real time and free of costs. In this paper;  we present a sampling decision system that relies on virtual measurements suggesting an efficient strategy for measuring productive wafers. Several methods for evaluating when a real measurement is needed (including the expected utility of measurement information;  a two-stage sampling decision model and wafer quality risk values) are proposed. We further provide ideas on how to assess and update the reliability of the virtual measurements in a sampling decision system (whenever real measurements become available). In this context;  we introduce equipment health factors and virtual trust factors for improving the reliability of the sampling decision system. Finally;  the performance of the sampling decision system is demonstrated on a set of virtual and real metrology data from the semiconductor industry. It is shown that wafer measurements are efficiently performed when really needed.
