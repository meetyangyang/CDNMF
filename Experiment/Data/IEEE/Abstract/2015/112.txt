This paper proposes an algorithm for robotic kinematic calibration based on a minimal product of exponentials (POE)-based model for the applications where only position measurements are required. Both joint zero-offset errors and initial frame twist error can be involved in this model. Analysis of the identifiability of these errors shows that at most six elements of these parameters can be identified. It also suggests that at least three noncollinear points on the end-effector should be measured to maximize the identifiability. Compared with the traditional POE-based model with full pose (position and orientation) measurements;  the minimal model with only position measurements outperforms in terms of convenience;  efficiency;  and accuracy.
