This paper explores the idea of manipulation-aided perception and grasping in the context of sorting small objects on a cluttered tabletop. We present a robust pipeline that combines perception and manipulation to accurately sort objects by some property (e.g.;  color;  size;  shape;  etc.). The pipeline uses two motion primitives to manipulate the scene in ways that help the robot to improve its perception and grasps. This results in the ability to sort cluttered object piles accurately. We also present an implementation on the PR2 robot that applies our algorithm to sort Duplo bricks by color and size;  and compare our method to brick sorting without the aid of manipulation. The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach;  particularly in environments with a high degree of clutter.
