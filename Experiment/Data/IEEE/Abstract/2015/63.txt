To solve the problem of generating segmentations of meaningful parts from scanned models with freeform surfaces;  we explore a compact shape prior-based segmentation approach in this paper. Our approach is inspired by an observation that a variety of natural objects consist of meaningful components in the form of compact shape and these components with compact shape are usually separated with each other by salient features. The segmentation for multiregions is performed in two phases in our framework. First;  the segmentation is taken in low-level with the help of discrete Morse complex enhanced by anisotropic filtering. Second;  we extract components with compact shape by using agglomerative clustering to optimize the normalized cut metric;  in which the affinities of boundary compatibility;  2D shape compactness and 3D shape compactness are incorporated. The practical functionality of our approach is proved by applying it to the application of customized dental treatment.
