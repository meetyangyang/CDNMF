This paper presents a remotely controlled welding scheme that enables transformation of human welder knowledge into a welding robot. In particular;  a 6-DOF UR-5 industrial robot arm is equipped with sensors to observe the welding process;  including a compact 3D weld pool surface sensing system and an additional camera to provide direct view of the work-piece. Human welder operates a virtual welding torch;  whose motion is tracked by a Leap sensor. To remotely operate the robot based on the motion information from the Leap sensor;  a predictive control approach is proposed to accurately track the human motion by controlling the speed of the robot arm movement. Tracking experiments are conducted to track both simulated movement with varying speed and actual human hand movement. It is found that the proposed predictive controller is able to track human hand movement with satisfactory accuracy. A welding experiment has also been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed remotely-controlled welding system. A foundation is thus established to realize teleoperation and help transfer human knowledge to the welding robot.
