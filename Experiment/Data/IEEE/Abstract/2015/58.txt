This paper presents the experimental validation of a multiple mobile robot system with human-in-the-loop coordination. It has been proposed that the control framework for networked autonomous robots can be augmented by artificial functions for task abstraction;  so that a human operator is able to operate a group of robots remotely. By utilizing the redundancy of a multirobot system with task-space control;  the group of mobile robots;  in addition to achieving the missions tele-controlled by the human;  can perform added tasks simultaneously. In this paper;  the human-robot cooperative control system was validated experimentally through a robotic manipulator and a group of mobile robots by taking into account communication delays. Multirobot coverage control;  formation control;  and cooperative transportation were demonstrated;  to validate the performance and efficiency of the robotic control system with human-in-the-loop coordination.
