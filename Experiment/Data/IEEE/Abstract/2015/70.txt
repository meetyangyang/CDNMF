This paper proposes a robust environmental sound recognition system using a fast noise suppression approach for home automation applications. The system comprises a fast subspace-based noise suppression module and a sound classification module. For the noise suppression module;  we propose a noise suppression method that applies fast subspace approximations in the wavelet domain. We show that this method offers a lower computational cost than conventional methods. In the sound classification module;  we use a feature extraction method that is also based on the wavelet subspace;  derived from seventeen critical bands in a signal's wavelet packet transform. Furthermore;  we create a multiclass support vector machine by employing probability product kernels. The experimental results for ten classes of various environmental sounds show that the proposed system offers robust performance in environmental sound recognition tasks.
