A recent paper titled “On the Problem of the Automated Design of Large-Scaled Robot Skin” (Anghinolfi et al.;  2013) published in the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering addressed the problem of covering the surface of a humanoid robot with the largest number of nonoverlapping equilateral triangular sensor modules. The problem is eventually approximated by a simpler one: how to find the placement of a given polygon P on an equilateral triangular grid G that contains the largest number of the grid triangles. In this paper;  we show how to improve the efficiency of the algorithm presented in that paper. Further;  we show that the general problem of filling P with the largest number of disjoint equilateral triangles (all entirely contained in P and all of the same size) is not equivalent to that of finding an optimal placement of P on G. Using this result;  we propose an improved heuristic for the original problem of covering the skin of a robot with the largest number of triangular sensor modules.
