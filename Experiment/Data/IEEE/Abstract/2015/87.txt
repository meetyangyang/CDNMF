We examine a non-cyclic scheduling problem of a wet station that performs cleaning processes for removing residual contaminants on wafer surfaces. Several chemical and rinse baths;  and multiple robots for transporting jobs are linearly combined in a wet station. A wet station in a fab tends to have different types of jobs. Therefore;  it is realistic to consider non-cyclic release of jobs into a wet station. We therefore examine a non-cyclic scheduling problem of a wet station that determines the task sequence of each robot so as to minimize the makespan of a given sequence of different jobs. We develop an efficient branch and bound procedure by examining the scheduling problem. To do this;  we first develop a Petri net model for the scheduling problem. By identifying deadlock prevention conditions from the Petri net model;  we eliminate partial solutions in advance that eventually will lead to a deadlock. By examining the feasible transition firings or state transition behavior of the Petri net model;  we branch only feasible partial solutions or nodes that correspond to feasible state transitions or transition firings. We also develop a tight lower bound based on the bottleneck workload of the baths. We prove computational efficiency of the branch and bound procedure for practical problems.
