Mobile robot typically has limited on-board resources and may be applied in different indoor environment. Thus;  it is necessary that they can learn a map and navigate themselves autonomously with lightweight algorithms. A novel topological map-building-based localization and navigation method is proposed in this paper. Based on the depth curve provided by a 3D sensor;  a progressive Bayesian classifier is developed to realize direct corridor type identification. Instead of extracting features from single observation;  information from multi-observations are fused to achieve a more robust performance. A topological map generation and loop closing method are proposed to build the environment map through autonomous exploration. Based on the derived map and the Markov localization method;  the robot can then localize itself and navigate freely in the indoor environment. Experiments are performed on a recently built mobile robot system;  and the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
