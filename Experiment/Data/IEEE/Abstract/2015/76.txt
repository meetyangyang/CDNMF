We consider the following motion-planning problem: we are given \\mbim unit discs in a simple polygon with \\mbin vertices;  each at their own start position;  and we want to move the discs to a given set of \\mbim target positions. Contrary to the standard (labeled) version of the problem;  each disc is allowed to be moved to any target position;  as long as in the end every target position is occupied. We show that this unlabeled version of the problem can be solved in \\mbiO(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n+mn) time;  assuming that the start and target positions are at least some minimal distance from each other. This is in sharp contrast to the standard (labeled) and more general multi-robot motion planning problem for discs moving in a simple polygon;  which is known to be strongly NP-hard.
