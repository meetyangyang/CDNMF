We present a high-performance and real-time production scheduling algorithm for digital print production based on a dynamic incremental evolutionary algorithm. The optimization objective is to prioritize the dispatching sequence of orders and balance resource utilization. The scheduler is scalable for realistic problem instances and it provides solutions quickly for diverse print products that require complex fulfillment procedures. Furthermore;  it dynamically ingests the transient state of the factory;  such as process information and resource failure probability in print production; therefore;  it minimizes the management-production mismatch. Discrete-event simulation results show that the production scheduler leads to a higher and more stable order on-time delivery ratio compared to a rule-based heuristic. Its beneficial attributes collectively contribute to the reduction or elimination of the shortcomings that are inherent in today's digital printing environment and help to enhance a print factory's productivity and profitability.
