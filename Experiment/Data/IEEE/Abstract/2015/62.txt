Development of a flexible low-cost robotic system to grasp various 3D workpieces is of practical important. Traditional approaches on 3D grasping usually need to compute the effective contact positions based on sufficient conditions;  such as “force-closure” or “form-closure; ” to prevent all the motions of the grasped objects. Compared with the previous work motivated by high-precision applications;  caging provides a way to manipulate an object without needing to immobilize it. However;  most caging conditions consider only 2D motions of the object in grasping. In some cases;  other motions in 3D space;  e.g.;  the pitch and roll rotations of the objects;  would also possibly change a caging configuration to an uncaging configuration. This paper aims to discuss caging with frictionless contact;  by taking into consideration of all the motions of the object. We first discuss the relationship between the gripper configuration and the state of the grasped object in grasping;  where all the motions of the object are taken into account. We then establish the sufficient conditions to find a set of 3D caging configurations in terms of the width of the object's projection and the gap of the gripper;  such that we can utilize the projection to find the feasible placements of the pins to determine the caging configuration. Furthermore;  we discuss how to find the caging configuration that is capable of leading to a form-closure based on attractive region formed in the configuration space.
