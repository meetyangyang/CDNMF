We extend our study of Motion Planning via Manifold Samples (MMS);  a general algorithmic framework that combines geometric methods for the exact and complete analysis of low-dimensional configuration spaces with sampling-based approaches that are appropriate for higher dimensions. The framework explores the configuration space by taking samples that are low-dimensional manifolds of the configuration space capturing its connectivity much better than isolated point samples. The scheme is particularly suitable for applications in manufacturing;  such as assembly planning;  where typically motion planning needs to be carried out in very tight quarters. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) We present a recursive application of MMS in a six-dimensional configuration space;  enabling the coordination of two polygonal robots translating and rotating amidst polygonal obstacles. In the adduced experiments for the more demanding test cases MMS clearly outperforms Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM);  with over 40-fold speedup in a six-dimensional coordination-tight setting. (ii) A probabilistic completeness proof for the case of MMS with samples that are affine subspaces. (iii) A closer examination of the test cases reveals that MMS has;  in comparison to standard sampling-based algorithms;  a significant advantage in scenarios containing high-dimensional narrow passages. This provokes a novel characterization of narrow passages;  which attempts to capture their dimensionality;  an attribute that had been (to a large extent) unattended in previous definitions.
