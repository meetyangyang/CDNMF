In semiconductor manufacturing;  wafer residency time constraints make the scheduling problem of cluster tools complicated. A process module (PM) in cluster tools is prone to failure. It is crucial to deal with any such failure in a proper and timely manner. If there are feasible periodic schedules in operating a cluster tool before and after a PM failure;  it is desired to make it operate continuously when such a failure occurs. However;  due to wafer residency time constraints;  it is highly challenging to control a tool such that it can be correctly transferred from a feasible schedule before failure to another after it. To solve this problem;  a Petri net model is developed to describe the dynamic behavior of a single-arm cluster tool and failure response policies are proposed. The proposed policies are formulated via simple control laws for their easy implementation. Examples are given to show them.
