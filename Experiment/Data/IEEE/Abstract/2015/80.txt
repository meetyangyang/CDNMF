This paper presents a novel high-bandwidth control approach for piezo-actuated nanopositioning stages. A delayed position feedback (DPF) controller is first developed in the inner loop to damp the resonant mode of piezo-actuated stages. A generalized Runge-Kutta method (GRKM) is proposed to determine the parameters of the DPF controller with pole placement. The benefit of the DPF for active damping is its simple structure and ease of implementation. Then;  a high-gain proportional-integral (PI) controller is designed in the outer loop to deal with the hysteresis nonlinearity;  disturbance and modeling errors. The stability of the control system is analyzed via a graphical method. Finally;  experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach in terms of tracking accuracy at high speed as compared to the PI controller.
