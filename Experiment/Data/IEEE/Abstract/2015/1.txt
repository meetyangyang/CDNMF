We present a novel system to achieve coordinated task-based control on a dual-arm industrial robot for the general tasks of visual servoing and bimanual hybrid motion/force control. The industrial robot;  consisting of a rotating torso and two seven degree-of-freedom arms;  performs autonomous vision-based target alignment of both arms with the aid of fiducial markers;  two-handed grasping and force control;  and robust object manipulation in a tele-robotic framework. The operator uses hand motions to command the desired position for the object via Microsoft Kinect while the autonomous force controller maintains a stable grasp. Gestures detected by the Kinect are also used to dictate different operation modes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a variety of common objects with different sizes;  shapes;  weights;  and surface compliances.
