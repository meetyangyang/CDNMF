In this paper;  a new method is proposed to evaluate the performance of concurrent systems. A concurrent system consisting of multiple processes that communicate via message passing mechanisms is modeled by a Petri net;  which is in turn represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a restricted type. The equations describe the system state changes;  and the solutions;  also called state measures;  can be used for the performance analysis such as estimating response time;  throughput and efficiency. This method can avoid a state explosion problem encountered by the conventional methods based on Continuous-Time Markov Chains. Its application to an IBM business system is given as an example.
