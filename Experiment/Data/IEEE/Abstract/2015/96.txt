A timed Petri net (TPN) has been widely used for modeling;  scheduling;  and analyzing discrete event dynamic systems. This study examines cyclic scheduling problems of a TPN to minimize the cycle time especially for automated manufacturing systems. Appropriate token routing at each conflict place can make a TPN repeat an identical firing sequence. We propose a systematic procedure to transform a TPN with such cyclic token routing into an equivalent timed event graph (TEG) for which the cycle time and firing schedules can be evaluated by a linear programming (LP). Based on the transformation procedure;  we develop an efficient branch and bound algorithm to solve the scheduling problem. A partial solution is defined as a partial token route that has only a subset of token routes for determining the complete schedule. The lower bound of a partial solution is determined by the cycle time of a TEG that has the partial token route. The cycle time of a TEG with an additional token route for a new partial solution is computed by a dual-simplex algorithm which avoids solving the LP completely again. A dynamic branching strategy that prevents unnecessary branching for the scheduling decision is also proposed. We demonstrate the computational efficiency through intensive experiments of cluster tools and robotic flow shops.
