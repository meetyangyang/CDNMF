This paper presents a controlled tying approach for knots using fixtures and simple pulling motions applied to the ends of string. Each fixture is specific to a particular knot; the paper gives a design process that allows a suitable fixture to be designed for an input knot. Knot tying is separated into two phases. In the first phase;  a fixture is used to loosely arrange the string around a set of rods;  with the required topology of the given knot. In the second phase;  the string is pulled taut around the tightening fixtures. Two tightening fixture designs are presented. The first design is a fixture with no moving parts; tilted rods whose cross-sections get closer near the tips;  guiding string in a controlled fashion as string slides up the rods during tightening. The second design is a collection of straight rods that can move passively along predefined paths during tightening. Successful tying is shown for three interesting cases: a “cloverleaf knot” design;  a “double coin” knot design;  and the top of a shoelace knot.
