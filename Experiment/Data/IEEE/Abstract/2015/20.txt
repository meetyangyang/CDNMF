Image and video sensors are increasingly being deployed in complex systems due to the rich process information that these sensors can capture. As a result;  image data play an important role in process monitoring and control in different application domains such as manufacturing processes;  food industries;  medical decision-making;  and structural health monitoring. Existing process monitoring techniques fail to fully utilize the information of color images due to their complex data characteristics including the high-dimensionality and correlation structure (i.e.;  temporal;  spatial and spectral correlation). This paper proposes a new image-based process monitoring approach that is capable of handling both grayscale and color images. The proposed approach models the high-dimensional structure of the image data with tensors and employs low-rank tensor decomposition techniques to extract important monitoring features monitored using multivariate control charts. In addition;  this paper shows the analytical relationships between different low-rank tensor decomposition methods. The performance of the proposed method in quick detection of process changes is evaluated and compared with existing methods through extensive simulations and a case study in a steel tube manufacturing process.
