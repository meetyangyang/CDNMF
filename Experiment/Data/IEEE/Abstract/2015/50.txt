We present distributed algorithms for multirobot task assignment where the tasks have to be completed within given deadlines. Each robot has a limited battery life and thus there is an upper limit on the amount of time that it has to perform tasks. Performing each task requires certain amount of time (called the task duration) and each robot can have different payoffs for the tasks. Our problem is to assign the tasks to the robots such that the total payoff is maximized while respecting the task deadline constraints and the robot's battery life constraints. Our problem is NP-hard since a special case of our problem is the classical generalized assignment problem (which is NP-hard). There are no known algorithms (distributed or centralized) for this problem with provably good guarantees of performance. We present a distributed algorithm for solving this problem and prove that our algorithm has an approximation ratio of 2. For the special case of constant task duration we present a distributed algorithm that is provably almost optimal. Our distributed algorithms are polynomial in the number of robots and the number of tasks. We also present simulation results to depict the performance of our algorithms.
