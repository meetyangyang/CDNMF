In this paper;  operator-based robust control for nonlinear uncertain system is considered by using robust right coprime factorization approach. In details;  the effects from uncertainties for nonlinear uncertain systems are analyzed through internally stable control design. For the stabilizing system;  an internal model control (IMC) like operator-based control design is proposed. Based on the proposed design scheme;  the effect from uncertainties is eliminated. By using operator theory-based approach;  the system is robustly stable and the desired tracking performance can be realized. Finally;  the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme is demonstrated by a simulation example.
