In scaling-up Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) array manufacturing;  the uniformity of CNTs' height;  or flatness of array;  is critical for the yield of nanodevices fabricated from CNTs;  and thus needs to be properly controlled. However;  since the flatness of the CNTs array is better characterized by a profile;  the conventional run-to-run (R2R) controllers that are designed for a single or multiple quality indicators are not effective in controlling the CNTs array manufacturing process. Therefore;  in this work;  we first develop a statistical model to characterize the variation of the flatness profile;  and then derive a novel R2R profile controller based on a state-space model and Kalman filter to improve the flatness of CNTs array. The performance of the proposed R2R control algorithm is studied and compared with existing controller via simulation studies.
