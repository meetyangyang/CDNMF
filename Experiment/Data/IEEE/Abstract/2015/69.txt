Detecting behavioral anomalies in human daily life is important to developing smart assisted-living systems for elderly care. Based on data collected from wearable motion sensors and the associated locational context;  this paper presents a coherent anomaly detection framework to effectively detect different behavioral anomalies in human daily life. Four types of anomalies;  including spatial anomaly;  timing anomaly;  duration anomaly;  and sequence anomaly;  are detected using a probabilistic theoretical framework. This framework is based on complex activity recognition using dynamic Bayesian network modeling. The maximum-likelihood estimation algorithm and Laplace smoothing are used in learning the parameters in the anomaly detection model. We conducted experimental evaluation in a mock apartment environment;  and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We expect that this behavioral anomaly detection system can be integrated into future smart homes for elderly care.
