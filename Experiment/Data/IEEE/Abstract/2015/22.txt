Transportation facility or automotive service enterprise location is an interesting and important issue. To improve transportation efficiency;  many researchers have addressed the traditional facility location allocation (FLA) problem;  e.g.;  the FLA problem with the minimum transportation cost or the maximum obtained profit. However;  with the improvement of saving energy awareness and the enhancement of environmental concerns;  energy efficient and low carbon emission should be considered as key factors influencing the FLA problem. To handle this issue via a more practical method;  this work proposes a sustainable location issue for an automotive service enterprise. That is;  by taking the vehicle inspection station as a typical automotive service enterprise and an example;  this work presents new energy-efficient models of its sustainable location with carbon constraints. An artificial fish swarm algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed models. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed models and testify the effectiveness of the algorithm.
