In this paper;  we present the design and implementation of Rapyuta;  an open-source cloud robotics platform. Rapyuta helps robots to offload heavy computation by providing secured customizable computing environments in the cloud. The computing environments also allow the robots to easily access the RoboEarth knowledge repository. Furthermore;  these computing environments are tightly interconnected;  paving the way for deployment of robotic teams. We also describe three typical use cases;  some benchmarking and performance results;  and two proof-of-concept demonstrations.
