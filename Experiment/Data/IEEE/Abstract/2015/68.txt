The aim of this paper is to improve the autonomy of medically monitored patients in a smart home instrumented only with binary sensors; overwatching the disease evolution;  that can be characterized by behavior changes;  is helped by detecting the activities the inhabitant performs. Two contributions are presented. On one hand;  using sequence mining methods in the flow of sensor events;  the most frequent patterns mirroring activities of the inhabitant are discovered; these activities are then modeled by an extended finite automaton;  which can then be used for activity recognition and generate activity events. On the other hand;  given the set of activities that can be recognized;  another automaton is built to model requirements from the medical staff supervising the inhabitant; it accepts activity events;  and residuals are defined to detect any behavior deviation. The whole method is applied to the dataset of Domus;  an instrumented smart home.
