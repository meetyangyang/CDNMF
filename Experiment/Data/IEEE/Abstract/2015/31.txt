The flexibility demands in manufacturing are severe;  e.g.;  for rapid-change-over to new product variants;  while robots are flexible machines that potentially can be adapted to a large variety of production tasks. Task definitions such as explicit robot programs are hardly reusable from an application point-of-view. To improve the situation;  a knowledge-based approach exploiting distributed declarative information and cloud computing offers many possibilities for knowledge exchange and reuse;  and it has the potential to facilitate new business models for industrial solutions. However;  there are many unresolved questions yet;  e.g.;  those related to reliability;  consistency;  or legal responsibility. To investigate some of these issues;  different knowledge-based architectures have been prototyped and evaluated by confronting the solution candidates with key application demands. The conclusion is that distributed cloud-based approaches offer many possibilities;  but there is still a need for further research and better infrastructure before this approach can become industrially attractive.
