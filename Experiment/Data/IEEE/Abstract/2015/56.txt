We present the methodology;  algorithms;  system design;  and experiments addressing the self-assembly of large teams of autonomous robotic boats into floating platforms. Identical self-propelled robotic boats autonomously dock together and form connected structures with controllable variable stiffness. These structures can self-reconfigure into arbitrary shapes limited only by the number of rectangular elements assembled in brick-like patterns. An O(m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n) complexity algorithm automatically generates assembly plans which maximize opportunities for parallelism while constructing operator-specified target configurations with m components. The system further features an O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\n) complexity algorithm for the concurrent assignment and planning of trajectories from n free robots to the growing structure. Such peer-to-peer assembly among modular robots compares favorably to a single active element assembling passive components in terms of both construction rate and potential robustness through redundancy. We describe hardware and software techniques to facilitate reliable docking of elements in the presence of estimation and actuation errors;  and we consider how these local variable stiffness connections may be used to control the structural properties of the larger assembly. Assembly experiments validate these ideas in a fleet of 0.5 m long modular robotic boats with onboard thrusters;  active connectors;  and embedded computers.
