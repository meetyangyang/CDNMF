Human welder's experiences and skills are critical for producing quality welds in manual gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process. In this paper;  a neuro-fuzzy-based human intelligence model is constructed and implemented as an intelligent controller in automated GTAW process to maintain a consistent desired full penetration. An innovative vision system is utilized to real-time measure the specular 3D weld pool surface under strong arc light interference. Experiments are designed to produce random changes in the welding speed and voltage resulting in fluctuations in the weld pool surface. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed to correlate the human welder's response to the 3D weld pool surface as characterized by its width;  length and convexity. Closed-loop control experiments are conducted to verify the robustness of the proposed controller. It is found that the human intelligence model can adjust the current to robustly control the process to a desired penetration state despite different initial conditions and various disturbances. A foundation is thus established to explore the mechanism and transformation of human welder's intelligence into robotic welding systems.
