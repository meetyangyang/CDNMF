In this paper;  the problems of state estimation are investigated for switched linear systems with average dwell time (ADT) switching in both continuous-time and discrete-time contexts. First;  a set of mode-dependent Luenberger-type observers is designed subject to the ADT switching that is synchronous with the switching of the estimated systems. Then;  a more practical case of the delayed observers is also considered;  which implies that the switching of the multiple-mode observer to be designed has a lag to the switching of the estimated systems. In this case;  the asynchronous switching signals are combined as a preliminary attempt;  upon which sufficient conditions for the existence of the Luenberger-type observers and the corresponding ADT switching are formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally;  the proposed approaches are applied to the state estimation of electronic circuits to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability.
