Automated manipulation of nanowires and nanotubes would enable the scalable manufacturing of nanodevices for a variety of applications;  including nanoelectronics and biological applications. In this paper;  we present an electric-field-based method for motion control;  planning;  and manipulation of nanowires in liquid suspension with a simple;  generic set of electrodes. We first present a dynamic model and a vision-based motion control of the nanowire motion in dilute suspension with a set of \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><tex Notation=\TeX\>$N\\times N$</tex> </formula>\n controllable electrodes. Since the motion planning of a nanowire from one position to the target location is NP-hard;  two heuristic algorithms are presented to generate near-optimal motion trajectories. We compare the heuristic motion planning algorithms with other existing algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) and \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex Notation=\TeX\>$A^{\\ast}$</tex></formula>\n algorithms. The comparisons show that the proposed heuristic algorithms obtain near-optimal minimum time trajectories. Finally;  we demonstrate a single;  integrated process to position;  orient;  and deposit multiple nanowires onto the substrate. Extensive experimental and numerical results are presented to confirm the motion control and planning algorithms.
