Optimizing HVAC operation becomes increasingly important because of the rising energy cost and comfort requirements. In this paper;  an innovative event-based approach is developed within the Lagrangian relaxation framework to minimize an HVAC's day-ahead energy cost. To solve the HVAC optimization problem based on events is challenging since with time-dependent uncertainties in weather;  cooling load;  etc.;  the optimal policy is not stationary. The nonstationary policy space is extremely large;  and it is time consuming to find the optimal policy. To overcome the challenge;  we develop an event-based approach to make the nonstationary optimal policy stationary in the planning horizon. The key idea is to augment state variables to include the time-dependent variables that make the optimal policy nonstationary and then define events based on the extended state variables. In addition;  we develop within the Lagrangian relaxation framework a Q-learning method where Q-factors are used to evaluate event-action pairs and to obtain the optimal policy. Numerical results demonstrate that;  as compared with time-based approaches;  the event-based approach maintains similar levels of energy costs and human comfort;  but reduces computational efforts significantly and has a much faster response to events.
