This paper proposes a novel scheme of nonuniform discretizetion-based control vector parameterization (ndCVP;  for short) for dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) of industrial processes. In our ndCVP scheme;  the time span is partitioned into a multitude of uneven intervals;  and incremental time parameters are encoded;  along with the control parameters;  into the individual to be optimized. Our coding method can avoid handling complex ordinal constraints. It is proved that ndCVP is a natural generalization of uniform discretization-based control vector parameterization (udCVP). By integrating ndCVP into hybrid gradient particle swarm optimization (HGPSO);  a new optimization method;  named ndCVP-HGPSO for short;  is formed. By application in four classic DOPs;  simulation results show that ndCVP-HGPSO is able to achieve similar or even better performances with a small number of control intervals; while the computational overheads are acceptable. Furthermore;  ndCVP and udCVP are compared in terms of two situations: given the same number of control intervals and given the same number of optimization variables. The results show that ndCVP can achieve better performance in most cases.
