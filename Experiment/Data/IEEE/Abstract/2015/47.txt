In autonomous multirobot systems one of the concerns is how to prevent collisions between the individual robots. One approach to this problem involves finding coordinated trajectories from start to destination for all the robots and then letting the robots follow the preplanned coordinated trajectories. A widely used practical method for finding such coordinated trajectories is “classical” prioritized planning;  where robots plan sequentially one after another. This method has been shown to be effective in practice;  but it is incomplete (i.e.;  there are solvable problem instances that the algorithm fails to solve) and it has not yet been formally analyzed under what circumstances is the method guaranteed to succeed. Further;  prioritized planning is a centralized algorithm;  which makes the method unsuitable for decentralized multirobot systems.
