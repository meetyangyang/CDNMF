Opacity is important in investigating secrecy;  privacy;  and other properties in general systems that can be modeled as discrete event systems. To ensure opacity;  a controller may be used to control information released to the public. For transparency and other reasons;  it is often desired that the information released to the public be maximum;  as long as opacity is not violated. In this paper;  we investigate how to release the maximum information while ensuring opacity. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for an information release policy to ensure opacity. We also develop methods and algorithms to design a controller that releases maximum information. We consider both strong opacity and weak opacity. We apply the results to the dining cryptographers problem.
