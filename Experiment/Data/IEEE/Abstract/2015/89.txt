This paper presents direct methods for vision-based control for the application of industrial inkjet printing. In this;  visual control is designed with a direct coupling between camera measurements and joint motion. Traditional visual servoing commonly has a slow visual update rate and needs an additional local joint controller to guarantee stability. By only using the product as reference and sampling with a high update rate;  direct visual measurements are sufficient for controlled positioning. The proposed method is simpler and more reliable than standard motor encoders;  despite the tight real-time constraints. This direct visual control method is experimentally verified with a 2D planar motion stage for micrometer positioning. To achieve accurate and fast motion;  a balance is found between frame rate and image size. With a frame rate of 1600 fps and an image size of 160 Ã— 100 pixels we show the effectiveness of the approach.
