This paper deals with the dynamic low-power reconfiguration of a real-time system. It processes periodic and probabilistic tasks that have hard/soft deadlines corresponding to internal/external events. A runtime event-based reconfiguration scenario is a dynamic operation allowing the addition/removal of the assumed periodic/probabilistic tasks. Thereafter;  some tasks may miss their hard deadlines and the power consumption may increase. In order to reconfigure the system to be feasible;  i.e.;  satisfying its real-time constraints with low-power consumption;  this research presents a software-agent-based architecture. An intelligent agent is developed;  which provides four solutions to reconfigure the system at runtime. For these solutions;  in order to reconfigure the probabilistic tasks to be feasible;  the agent modifies their temporal parameters dynamically; moreover;  in order to feasibly serve the probabilistic tasks and reduce the system's power consumption;  the agent provides three virtual processors by dynamically extending the periods of the periodic tasks. A simulation study verifies the effectiveness of the agent.
