This paper addresses the problem of mental fatigue caused by prolonged use of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) Systems. We propose a system that gradually becomes autonomous by learning user preferences and by considering error perception feedback. As a particular application;  we show that our system allows patients to control electronic appliances in a hospital room;  and learns the correlation of room sensor data;  brain states;  and user control commands. Moreover;  error perception feedback based on a brain potential called error related negativity (ERN) - that spontaneously occurs when the user perceives an error made by the system - was used to correct system's mistakes and improve its learning performance. Experimental results with volunteers demonstrate that our system reduces the level of mental fatigue;  and achieves over 90% overall learning performance when error perception feedback is considered.
