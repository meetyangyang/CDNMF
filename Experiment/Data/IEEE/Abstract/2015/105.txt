Web service composition is a challenging research issue. This paper presents an automatic Web service composition method that deals with both input/output compatibility and behavioral constraint compatibility of fuzzy semantic services. First;  user input and output requirements are modeled as a set of facts and a goal statement in the Horn clauses;  respectively. A service composition problem is transformed into a Horn clause logic reasoning problem. Next;  a Fuzzy Predicate Petri Net (FPPN) is applied to model the Horn clause set;  and T-invariant technique is used to determine the existence of composite services fulfilling the user input/output requirements. Then;  two algorithms are presented to obtain the composite service satisfying behavioral constraints;  as well as to construct an FPPN model that shows the calling order of the selected services.
