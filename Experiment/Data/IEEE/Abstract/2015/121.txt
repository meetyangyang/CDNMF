Chatting with nearby interested strangers instantly in location-based mobile social network (LMSN) has become increasingly popular. Currently;  friend recommendation relies only on the simple and limited user profiles;  and is agnostic to users' offline behaviors in the real world. For the first time;  we focus on utilizing the user's check-in behaviors in the real world;  instead of the general acquaintance-based social circles;  to instantly recommend nearby strangers to make friends. However;  bridging nearby strangers with similar check-in behaviors instantly has some new characteristics;  such as lack of common friends and interaction histories;  temporal;  spatial and user three-dimensional correlation;  and sparseness of check-ins. Most existing work about friend recommendations mainly focuses on making friends within the acquaintance-based social circles;  and has not fully considered these new characteristics mentioned above. Therefore;  how to catch the ephemeral opportunity to recommend nearby interested strangers instantly remains a challenge. In this paper;  we present to use “Encounter” probability to measure the behavior similarity of two strangers in the real world based on their check-in histories. To address the sparseness challenge of check-in data;  a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)-based user check-in probability estimation method considering the spatiotemporal dimensions is proposed to estimate each user's check-in probability distribution with time at each spot. Finally;  we use a large-scale user check-in dataset of Gowalla to validate the effectiveness of this approach. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms other commonly used similarity computation methods.
