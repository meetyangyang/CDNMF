While flow line models have been studied for decades;  excepting some cases with three servers or less;  their equilibrium probabilities remain elusive. As such;  approximations based on aggregation or decomposition methods are generally employed. In this paper;  by focusing on flow lines with deterministic service durations and a renewal arrival process;  we develop exact methods for steady-state analysis. Our starting point is the investigation of recursions for customer delay based on exact decomposition methods. We demonstrate that the delay a customer faces in each server possesses a Markovian property. For discrete-time flow lines;  we obtain a multidimensional discrete-time time-homogeneous Markov chain for the delays; there are an infinite number of balance equations for the equilibrium probabilities. Exploiting a similarity between our system and the GI/D/1 queue allows us to reduce these to a finite number of balance equations that can be solved numerically. We also investigate the implications for continuous-time flow lines and consider an example inspired by production time windows in semiconductor manufacturing. To our knowledge;  these are the first results that allow one to exactly obtain the equilibrium probabilities in flow lines consisting of more than three servers.
