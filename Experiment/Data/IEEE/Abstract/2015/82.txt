Public Bicycle-Sharing Systems (PBSS) have been appearing in more and more cities around the world in the last few years. Although their apparent success as an alternative form of public transportation mode;  there are major challenges confronting the operators while few scientific works are available to support such complex dynamical systems to influence their economic viability and operational efficiency. One of the most crucial factors for the success of a PBS system is its ability to ensure that bicycles are available for pick up and vacant berths available for bicycle drop off at every station. In this paper;  we develop an original discrete event approach for modelling and performance evaluation of public bicycle-sharing systems by using Petri nets with time;  inhibitor arcs and variable arc weights.
