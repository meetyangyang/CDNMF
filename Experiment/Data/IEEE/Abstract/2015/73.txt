This paper presents a district energy management strategy devoted to monitor and control the district power consumption in a twofold human-centered perspective: the respect of user's comfort preferences and the minimization of the power consumption and costs. The presented district energy management system forwards the power profile determined the day ahead to each building energy management system that;  in turn;  minimizes its real-time power consumption and costs (based on rewards and penalties);  respecting the comfort preferences. Successively;  the power is redistributed among the district buildings in order to minimize the penalties by applying two approaches: a centralized approach for public buildings and a distributed methodology for private buildings. Such optimization problems are formalized by defining some linear programming problems: two case studies are solved to show the applicability of the proposed management strategies.
