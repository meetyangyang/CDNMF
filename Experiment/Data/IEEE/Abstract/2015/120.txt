Video may pass through various types of heterogeneous networks during the process of transmission;  which has adverse impacts on the real-time video quality. Traditional methods focus on how to compress videos based on the video flow without considering the real-time network information. This paper presents an adaptive method that combines video encoding and the video transmission control system over heterogeneous networks. This method includes the following steps: first;  to collect and standardize the real-time information describing the network and the video;  then to assess the video quality and calculate the video coding rate based on the standardized information;  and then to process the encoded compression of the video according to the calculated coding rate and transfer the compressed video. The experiments show that there is a significant improvement for the quality of real-time videos transmission without changing the existing network;  particularly the core equipment. Our solution is easy to deploy and implement quickly and may help to extensively ensure video quality for normal users.
