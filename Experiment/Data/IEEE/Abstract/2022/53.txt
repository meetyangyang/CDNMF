Microfluidic devices for cell immobilization have significantly advanced the biological analysis at the single-cell level. However;  the previous research on immobilization of multiple single cells;  especially with deterministic quantities;  is insufficient. In this paper;  we proposed a novel microfluidic device based on the passive hydrodynamics and the uniform geometric design principle;  which can array different numbers of cells in every capture cavity. The capture cavities could be stretched to accommodate more cells;  and the trapping force was adjusted by modifying the related geometric parameters of the inside channel. The whole procedure was monitored and further automatized by integrating computer vision technology under a microscope. On the proposed integrated on-chip platform;  we realized full-automated arraying of a single cell;  two cells;  and three cells on a single chip;  achieving success rates up to 95%;  75%;  and 72%;  respectively. As a primary experimental demonstration;  the cell viability test of arraying multiple cells with different quantities showed excellent biocompatibility and no significant association between trapping quantity and cell survivability. We envision that the proposed quantity-controllable;  high-efficiency microfluidic devices for multiple cell arraying could be a powerful platform for an in-depth study of cell heterogeneity and cell communication between multiple cells. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
