Missing data is quite common in the industrial field;  resulting in problems in downstream applications;  as most data driven methods used in these applications rely on complete and high-quality dataset to build a high-quality model. Existing methods deal with missing data individually regardless of its downstream application;  treating all variables equally without considering their different roles in the downstream application. This would affect imputation performance for key variables;  thus deteriorating the accuracy of the downstream model. A considerable challenge is how to refine the missing data imputation task. In this paper;  a new method termed fine-tuned imputation GAN (FIGAN) is designed to achieve customized data imputation for industrial soft sensor. The major contribution of the paper lies in two aspects: 1) different from the original imputation GAN (GAIN) which treats all variables equally;  FIGAN is guided by a soft sensor module so as to achieve customized data imputation by performing improved data imputation on quality-related variables. Enhanced accuracy for the final industrial soft sensor would be possible; 2) in addition;  since labels of the soft sensor might also have missing data;  a soft sensor with pseudo labeling is designed to conquer the problem with data imputation and label prediction being optimized interactively. Case studies on a converter steelmaking process and a penicillin fermentation process show the feasibility of the proposed FIGAN. It is noted that such customized imputation could be readily transferred to other downstream applications with missing data.
