With an increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage systems (BSSs);  there are major challenges in the distribution grid to maintain a scaling control structure. Also;  with the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology;  EVs can now inject power into the grid for voltage regulation. This article proposes a new distributed real-time alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to control EVs and BSSs for voltage regulation while maximizing their utility function. More specifically;  a continuous-domain real-time optimization and control algorithm is developed in closed form;  which exchanges relevant information among the neighboring nodes through the communication network and optimizes a combined convex objective of EVs and BSSs welfare and voltage regulation with power flow equations as constraints. Convergence analysis is provided using the Lyapunov direct approach;  and simulation results are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
