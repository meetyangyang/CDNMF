Human-machine interactive systems show increasing demand for analysing fast moving objects in high-frame-rate videos. Robust foreground detection;  which is able to reduce large amount of redundant background data from high-frame-rate video;  becomes the essence to achieve ultra-high-speed human-machine interactions. This paper proposes a local spatial propagation based background model generation;  a local linear illumination correction based background model update;  and a regional central coordinates and edge keypoints constrained foreground region reselection. The three proposals make up a robust and hardware-friendly foreground detection method. Experimental results prove that the proposed hardware-friendly algorithm achieves high accuracy and robustness on various kinds of challenging cases. Meanwhile;  the hardware implementation utilizes little hardware resources and achieves realtime processing of high-frame-rate (784 frame/second) video with the delay less than 1 ms/frame in image processing core. In addition;  a practical system is implemented by combing a PC;  a high-speed camera and a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for realworld applications. This work will significatively promote the development and application of high-speed human machine interaction.
