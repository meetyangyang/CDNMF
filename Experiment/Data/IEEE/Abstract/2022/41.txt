We describe a method for decentralized control of route-based material handling systems in which devices have no central controller (by definition);  no common source of information;  and no synchronized or common clocks with which to plan and execute their activities. The control scheme is based on the concept of logical time;  which is a means of partially ordering events in computer operating systems. We modify the concept to the domain of material handling systems and prove system liveness. We conclude by describing GridSorter;  a conveyance-based sorter that uses decentralized control and logical time to sort packages. A prototype has been successfully built and tested at the Institute for Material Handling and Logistics;  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
