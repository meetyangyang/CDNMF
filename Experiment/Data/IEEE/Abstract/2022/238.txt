Some response surface functions in complex engineering systems are usually highly nonlinear;  unformed;  and expensive to evaluate. To tackle this challenge;  Bayesian optimization (BO);  which conducts sequential design via a posterior distribution over the objective function;  is a critical method used to find the global optimum of black-box functions. Kernel functions play an important role in shaping the posterior distribution of the estimated function. The widely used kernel function;  e.g.;  radial basis function (RBF);  is very vulnerable and susceptible to outliers; the existence of outliers is causing its Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model to be sporadic. In this article;  we propose a robust kernel function;  asymmetric elastic net radial basis function (AEN-RBF). Its validity as a kernel function and computational complexity are evaluated. When compared with the baseline RBF kernel;  we prove theoretically that AEN-RBF can realize smaller mean squared prediction error under mild conditions. The proposed AEN-RBF kernel function can also realize faster convergence to the global optimum. We also show that the AEN-RBF kernel function is less sensitive to outliers;  and hence improves the robustness of the corresponding BO with GPs. Through extensive evaluations carried out on synthetic and real-world optimization problems;  we show that AEN-RBF outperforms the existing benchmark kernel functions.
