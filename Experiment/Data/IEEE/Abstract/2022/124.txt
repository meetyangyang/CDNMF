<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>Compositional Optimization</i>\n (CompOpt) was recently proposed for optimization of discrete-event systems of systems. A modular optimization model allows CompOpt to divide the optimization into separate sub-problems;  mitigating the state space explosion problem. This paper presents the Modular Optimization Learner (MOL);  a method that interacts with a simulation of a system to automatically learn these modular optimization models. MOL uses a \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>modular learning</i>\n that takes as input a hypothesis structure of the system and uses the provided structural information to split the acquired learning into a set of modules;  and to prune parts of the search space. Experiments show that modular learning reduces the state space by many orders of magnitude compared to a monolithic learning;  which enables learning of much larger systems. Furthermore;  an integrated greedy search heuristic allows MOL to remove many sub-optimal paths in the individual modules;  speeding up the subsequent optimization. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
