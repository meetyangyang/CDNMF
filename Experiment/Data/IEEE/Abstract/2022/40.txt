We propose and address a new variation of the team orienteering problem (TOP) in which all members of the team are independent self-interested agents. The prize-collecting nature emanates from the fact that the prize available at a node of the traversal graph can be collected only by a single visiting agent. The problem is motivated by situations in which team members (agents) must accomplish tasks toward a common goal but are unable to communicate;  such as a fleet of surveillance drones operating in a communication denied area or with remote pilots operating independently. We explore three policies for minimizing the amount of inefficiency these self-interested agents can bring into the situation. We analyze these policies in a game-theoretic framework and show upper bounds on the Price of Anarchy (PoA) ranging from \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\approx 1.582$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n to unbounded depending on the policy;  network type;  and the number of players \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n. This is done by extending well-known PoA bounds for valid utility systems to a leaderâ€“follower setting. The PoA also depends on the behavior of the agents;  which could not have goodwill toward other agents. In many cases;  we are able to provide examples that establish the tightness of the bounds. Finally;  solution methods are provided for each of these policies. Numerical results computed by these solution methods are then presented and compared with the optimal centrally coordinated solutions. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
