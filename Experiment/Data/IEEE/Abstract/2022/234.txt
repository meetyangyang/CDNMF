In semiconductor manufacturing;  virtual metrology (VM) is a method of predicting physical measurements of wafer qualities using in-process information from sensors on production equipment. The relevance vector machine (RVM) is a sparse Bayesian kernel machine that has been widely used for VM modeling in semiconductor manufacturing. Missing values from equipment sensors;  however;  preclude training an RVM model due to missing kernels from incomplete instances. Moreover;  imputation for such kernels can lead to a loss of model sparsity. In this work;  we propose a restricted RVM (RRVM) that selects its basis functions from only complete instances to handle incomplete data for VM. We conduct the experiments using toy data and real-life data from an etching process for wafer fabrication. The results indicate the modelâ€™s competitive prediction accuracy with massive missing data while maintaining model sparsity.
