Rotary encoders are commonly used for dynamic control and positioning of industrial robots. Results of this study suggested that rotary encoder signal can also be used to monitor the efficiency of industrial robot systems effectively after proper processing. A novel strategy using singular spectrum analysis (SSA) integrated with hierarchical hyper-Laplacian prior prototype (HHLP) is proposed in this study for defect detection in industrial robots. Sparsity-assisted techniques are efficient flaw-based extraction techniques that have been extensively investigated in recent years. However;  the selection of an appropriate sparse prior from the point of view of probability theory remains unverified. First;  SSA enables the separation of complicated encoding signals to several interpretable components;  including a trend;  a set of cyclic oscillations;  and residual oscillations (noise). Second;  we describe HHLP by maximizing posterior probability of robot flaw diagnosis. HHLP is proposed to extract noise interference;  cyclic pulse;  and harmonic interference from the residual signal using the SSA technique. We infer that the hyper-Laplacian prior in the prototype may present a more efficient prototype flaw than the Laplacian prior. In addition;  HHLP incorporates physical characteristics necessary to distinguish harmonic intervention. This study primarily establishes a modern prototype that represents the former dispersed from the perspective of maximizing the probability of the latter. Meanwhile;  generalized minimax-concave regularization inductive and kurtosis-based weighted sparse prototypes are compared and spectral kurtosis is used to confirm the efficacy of HHLP.
