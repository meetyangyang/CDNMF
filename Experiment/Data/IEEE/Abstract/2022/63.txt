Outpatient clinics typically face a critical issue in patient adherence to their clinic appointments and suffer a huge backlog of patients waiting to be seen. The goal of this study is to enhance care provider productivity and patient access through effective clinic appointment scheduling. To achieve this goal;  we introduce discrete-time bulk-service queues to model the backlog dynamics accounting for the no-show behavior of patients and consider different overbooking strategies to reduce backlogs at a minimum risk of working overtime. Numerically stable solution procedures and approximation methods are introduced to significantly reduce the computational burden;  making the queueing models a practical tool for outpatient appointment template design. The insights obtained from this work will support capacity planning decision-making and are critical to improving the operational efficiency of outpatient clinics. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
