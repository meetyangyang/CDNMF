The radio block center (RBC) is one of the most essential ground systems in a high-speed train control system both in Europe and in China. The RBC handover procedure is an important function of RBC;  which affects the transport efficiency;  reliability and safety of railways. Analysis of crucial states in the RBC handover procedure is helpful to determine whether there are potential risks in the procedure;  and to locate the fault in time when a fault occurs. In this paper;  we study a property;  called C-detectability;  of the RBC handover. This property has been defined in discrete event systems and requires that the crucial states can be determined uniquely by observing the system output. Taking the RBC handover procedure in the Chinese train control system level 3 (CTCS-3) as an example;  we first model the RBC handover procedure using Petri nets;  which are a graphical and mathematical modeling tool to formalize the behavior of discrete event systems. Then;  based on the notion of basis reachability graph;  an efficient approach is used to check C-detectability of the Petri net modeling the handover procedure. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
