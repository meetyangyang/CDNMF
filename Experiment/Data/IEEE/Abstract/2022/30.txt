Estimation of center of mass (CoM) and center of pressure (CoP) is critical for lower limb exoskeletons;  prostheses;  and legged robots. To meet the demand in these fields;  this study presents a novel CoM and CoP estimation method for human walking through a wearable visual odometry (VO) device. This method is named VO-based estimation of CoM and CoP (VOECC). The methodology of VOECC is that the VO provides CoM trajectory estimation and the inherent walking dynamics model is exploited as prior knowledge for CoP trajectory estimation during human walking. Gait cycle is estimated based on the frequency analysis of the CoM trajectory;  which is cropped into segments. Each segment mainly includes a half gait cycle. The segments are designed to be sliding to mitigate the disturbance of double-stance phase. For each segment;  a quadratic programming (QP) problem is formulated to fit the CoM measurement with the theoretical walking dynamics model. The solution to this QP problem is an optimal gait parameters estimation;  including CoP. Based on this solution;  the human walking model with the CoM trajectory and CoP excursion is reconstructed. VOECC is evaluated experimentally where human walks on level ground and upstairs with VO device attached in front of the chest. The ground truth of CoM and CoP position is directly measured by the motion capture system and fully instrumented treadmill;  respectively;  and compared with the VOECC results. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in terms of wearable and extensible functionalities compared with the existing methods. Root-mean-squared errors between the CoP measured by fully instrumented treadmill and the CoP estimated by VOECC are evaluated and compared. This method has the potential to be extensible in lower limb rehabilitation;  prosthetic;  and legged locomotion fields.
