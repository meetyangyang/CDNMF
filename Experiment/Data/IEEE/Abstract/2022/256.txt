This paper introduces a novel practice of using image based condition classification and visualization system to augment operators in the task of monitoring the working condition of fused magnesium furnace. The system implements two functions: working condition detection and remote visually reconstruction of the furnace flame. For the problem of working condition detection;  we combine the image features and the smelting electrical currents to train the classifier under semi-supervised learning framework. We also introduce a highly efficient cross-entropy based optimization method for training. For the visualization task;  we propose a practical end-to-end solution which can visually simulate the dynamic furnace flame at remote monitoring consoles according to the visual feature of the monitoring video. Finally;  we introduce the distributed structure of the monitoring system which consists of a private cloud;  an edge server and remote monitoring consoles. The proposed solution can be applicable for various monitoring tasks in industry.
