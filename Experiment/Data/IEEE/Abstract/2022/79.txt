Business process similarity measures are of vital importance for process repository management applications;  such as process query;  process recommendation;  and process clustering. Most existing approaches measure process similarity by relying on control-flow structures only. This article investigates the role of data in process similarity measure. To incorporate data-flow information into business process control flow;  it proposes a data-aware workflow net (DWF-net) by extending the classical workflow net with data reading and writing semantics. Then;  we introduce three types of similarity measures;  i.e.;  data item set-based similarity;  data operation set-based similarity;  and data-aware behavior-based similarity;  to quantify the similarity of data-aware business processes from different perspectives. Next;  a methodology is introduced to help process analysts apply these three measures in a systematical way. Finally;  we evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed similarity measures by a group of comparative experiments. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
