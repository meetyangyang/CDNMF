The moving components and servo control systems of computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools spent a substantial energy but received less attention regarding energy saving. This article presents a novel energy saving methodology of feed system using a data-model hybrid driven design optimization approach for the integrated design of moving component structural geometry and control system. Surrogate models are built based on the design of experimental data to avoid time-consuming finite element analysis. The energy consumption mechanism model is constructed via energy flow analysis method. The data-model hybrid modeling method realizes the collaborative optimization of the machine tool feed system structure and controller;  while simultaneously accelerating the optimization process. A multi-objective trade-off model with energy consumption and deformation is established. Three different multi-objective optimization approaches are taken to drive the developed multi-objective optimization model. The control performance of the feed system is demonstrated through simulation analysis. Results indicate that the optimized scheme can reduce energy consumption by over 10% and maximum deformation of the tool holder by over 14%.
