In this article;  we discuss a sequential algorithm for the computation of a minimum-time speed profile over a given path;  under velocity;  acceleration;  and jerk constraints. Such a problem arises in industrial contexts;  such as automated warehouses;  where LGVs need to perform assigned tasks as fast as possible in order to increase productivity. It can be reformulated as an optimization problem with a convex objective function;  linear velocity and acceleration constraints;  and nonconvex jerk constraints;  which;  thus;  represent the main source of the difficulty. While existing nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers can be employed for the solution of this problem;  it turns out that the performance and robustness of such solvers can be enhanced by the sequential line-search algorithm proposed in this article. At each iteration;  a feasible direction;  with respect to the current feasible solution;  is computed;  and a step along such direction is taken in order to compute the next iterate. The computation of the feasible direction is based on the solution of a linearized version of the problem;  and the solution of the linearized problem;  through an approach that strongly exploits its special structure;  represents the main contribution of this work. The efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to existing NLP solvers is proven through different computational experiments.
