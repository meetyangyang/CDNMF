With the increasing market penetration of electric vehicles (EVs);  the charging behavior and driving characteristics of EVs have an increasing impact on the operation of power grids and traffic networks. Existing research on EV routing planning and charging navigation strategies mainly focuses on vehicle-road-network interactions;  but the vehicle-to-vehicle interaction has rarely been considered;  particularly in studying simultaneous charging requests. To investigate the interaction of multiple vehicles in routing planning and charging;  a routing optimization of EVs for charging with an event-driven pricing strategy is proposed. The urban area of a city is taken as a case for numerical simulation;  which demonstrates that the proposed strategy can not only alleviate the long-time queuing for EV fast charging but also improve the utilization rate of charging infrastructures.
