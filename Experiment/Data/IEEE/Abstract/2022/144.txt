In the real-time status monitoring of pipeline network;  incomplete pressure data are unavoidable due to some device or communication errors. To solve this problem;  a hierarchical data recovery method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) is proposed in this article. First;  a hierarchical data recovery framework is proposed to handle different numbers of incomplete data due to the structure of the semicentral pipeline network. Second;  a joint attention module is presented to capture both interior nature and correlation relationships of multivariate pressure series and further guarantee the consistency of pressure data. Third;  the macromicrodual discriminators are proposed to evaluate the recovery result through the combination of the local and global variation in temporal and spatial dependencies. Based on the novel structures;  the proposed model is able to recover incomplete data with abnormal fluctuation values;  unreasonable fixed values;  or missing values. Finally;  under a series of data recovery experiments;  the efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is a practical way to ensure data recovery performance in the pipeline network. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
