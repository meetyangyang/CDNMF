The integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem is studied in this article;  in which operation sequencing;  process plan selection;  and machine selection are decided simultaneously. For different scenarios;  three mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models are designed. Then;  in view of the workload of machines and processing times of jobs;  two machine selection techniques are introduced to simplify the optimization of these MILP models. By exploring the structural properties of the MILP models;  we put forward a novel lower bound to act as a measurement for the performance of the related algorithms. Considering the real-time requirement and complexity of instances in practice;  we design a hybrid greedy heuristic based on a new decision structure of the problem and dispatching rules. Furthermore;  in order to create effective dispatching rules to improve the hybrid greedy heuristic;  enhanced genetic programming (GP)-based iterative approach is proposed. Experimental results indicate that our approaches are better than other available approaches for the IPPS problem and can reduce the computational time while providing high-quality solutions. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
