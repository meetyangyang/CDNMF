Designing and installing jigs and fixtures for new products are very costly tasks. In order to rapidly respond to frequent product changes in a manufacturing system;  we developed a transformable pin array fixture system including reconfiguration planning software that finds the optimal position for mounting an assembly part and automatically generates a pin height control code. We first classified main fixturing quality factors such as type of contact;  distance between a pin and a joining point;  and part shape. We then formulate the part positioning problem as an alignment problem between the joining point set and the pin point set in the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>xy</i>\n plane in consideration of the fixturing quality factors. A car door trim assembly module was used to verify the proposed method. Finite-element analysis results showed that in a car door trim assembly process such as ultrasonic welding and screwing;  relocating an assembly part at the optimal position reduces its deformation. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
