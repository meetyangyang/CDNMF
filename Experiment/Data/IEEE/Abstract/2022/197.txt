In this article;  we propose a redundant fault-tolerant and boundary constraint control in the framework of adaptive method;  the neural network approximation;  and the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) with a relaxed initial condition. The actuator failures are compensated by a combination of adaptive methods and redundant actuators when some actuators suffer from partial or even total loss of effectiveness. The radial basis functionâ€™s neural network structure is introduced to strengthen the adaptivity in various orientations of the hose and other additionally unmodeled dynamics. To maintain the boundary deflection within a predefined open set after a constraint time;  a novel asymmetrical and time-varying BLF is constructed by applying a shifting function to transform the original state into a new state with zero value initially. The performance of the developed adaptive control is demonstrated by numerical simulations.
