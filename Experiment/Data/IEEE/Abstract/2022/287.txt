Nowadays the robot manipulation skills are usually learned by human demonstration via trajectory-level learning, which somewhat lacks robustness and generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel contact state level learning method for robot manipulation skill acquisition via human demonstration. The robot-environment contact states are described via environment dynamics modelling and geometric constraints modelling for flexible contact and rigid contact cases, respectively. During human demonstration process, the robot-environment interaction force, the robot position, and velocity data are collected. After that, the environment dynamics and geometric constraints modelling methods are presented to determine the contact state changes during the robot manipulation process. Then the robot manipulator learns the contact state information rather than specific manipulation trajectory. On this basis, the manipulation control law using active exploration method is presented to control the robot during the button pressing process and peg-hole-insertion process, respectively. Finally, the performance of the presented methodology has been verified via experimental studies.
