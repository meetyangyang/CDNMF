This work considers a stochastic flexible job shop scheduling with limited extra resources and machine-dependent setup time in a semiconductor manufacturing environment;  which is an NP-hard problem. In order to obtain its reliable and high-performance schedule in a reasonable time;  a learning-based grey wolf optimizer is proposed. In it;  an optimal computing budget allocation-based approach;  which is designed for two scenarios from real manufacturing environments;  is proposed to intelligently allocate computing budget and improve search efficiency. It extends the application area of optimal computing budget allocation by laying a theoretic foundation. Besides;  to obtain proper control parameters iteratively;  a reinforcement learning algorithm with a newly designed delay update strategy is used to build a parameter tuning scheme of a grey wolf optimizer. The scheme acts as a guide for balancing global and local search;  thereby enhancing effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The theoretic interpretation of the developed optimal computing budget allocation-based approach and the convergence analysis results of the proposed algorithm are presented. Various experiments with benchmarks and randomly generated cases are performed to compare it with several updated algorithms. The results shows its superiority over them.
