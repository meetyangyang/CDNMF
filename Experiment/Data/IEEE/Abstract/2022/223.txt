Touch-response experimentation in zebrafish helps researchers better understand the link between genetics;  drug effects;  and behaviors. However;  commonly manually conducted experimentation cannot fulfill a high-throughput screening and often delivers low accuracy and lacks reproducibility. Thus;  the main aim of this work is to establish a fully automated robot-assisted experimentation system with minimal human participation to conduct the touch-response experimentation with freely swimming zebrafish larvae. Our designed system is able to undertake the role of repeated touch-response experiments at predefined specific location of the larvae in different ages and under different conditions;  with high accuracy;  robustness;  and repeatability;  and can also get comparable experimental results. The errors of the detection methods are less than 3 pixels and the offset errors of the touching points are less than 5%. Designed for high-efficiency experimentation;  this system will promisingly release a great amount of the burden for the biological operators from touch-response experiments and may also have potential applications in other organisms for touch-evoked response analysis.
