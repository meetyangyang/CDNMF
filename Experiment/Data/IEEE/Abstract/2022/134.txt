Human-robot collaboration (HRC);  where humans and robots work together to handle specific tasks;  requires designing robots that can effectively support human beings. Robots need to conduct reasoning using commonsense knowledge (CSK);  e.g.;  fundamental knowledge that humans possess and use subconsciously;  in order to assist humans in challenging and dynamic environments. Currently;  there are several effective CSK systems used for organizing information and facts;  along with detecting objects and determining their properties. HRC is employed in various manufacturing tasks;  such as paint spraying and assembly;  in order to keep humans safe while increasing efficiency. Although there is a large array of research on HRC and on CSK;  there is minimal research linking the two concepts together. This paper presents a novel system on human-robot collaboration guided by commonsense reasoning for automation in manufacturing tasks. This fits within the general realm of smart manufacturing. The primary focus is on improving the efficacy of human-robot co-assembly tasks. Evaluations conducted with online simulations and real-world experiments indicate that reasoning using CSK-based robot priorities enhances HRC as compared to simpler robot priorities;  e.g.;  merely handling nearby objects. This system is modifiable and can be used for larger and more complex real-world tasks;  thereby leading to improved automation in manufacturing. This paper demonstrates the scope of combining HRC and CSK;  while future works will be able to further utilize the benefits of combining the two fields with significant impacts. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
