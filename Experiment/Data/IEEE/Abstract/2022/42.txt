This article proposes a stochastic nonlinear model predictive controller to support policymakers in determining robust optimal nonpharmaceutical strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic waves. First;  a time-varying SIRCQTHE epidemiological model is defined to get predictions on the pandemic dynamics. A stochastic model predictive control problem is then formulated to select the necessary control actions (i.e.;  restrictions on the mobility for different socioeconomic categories) to minimize the socioeconomic costs. In particular;  considering the uncertainty characterizing this decision-making process;  we ensure that the capacity of the healthcare system is not violated in accordance with a chance constraint approach. The effectiveness of the presented method in properly supporting the definition of diversified nonpharmaceutical strategies for tackling the COVID-19 spread is tested on the network of Italian regions using real data. The proposed approach can be easily extended to cope with other countriesâ€™ characteristics and different levels of the spatial scale. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
