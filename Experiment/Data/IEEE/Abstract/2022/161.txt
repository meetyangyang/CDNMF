In this article;  we present a method for constructing the fault detector in the form of signal temporal logic (STL) formulas;  which can be understood by human users and formally proven to detect faults with probabilistic satisfaction guarantees;  for a class of switched nonlinear systems with partially unknown dynamics. First;  the partially unknown internal dynamics are approximated by the Gaussian process with stability guarantees. Second;  a novel temporal logic inference algorithm is proposed to find the fault detector;  which takes advantage of the internal properties of temporal logic and searches for the optimal formula along a partially ordered direction. Moreover;  the algorithm is not allowed for missing faults but allowed for false alarms during the temporal logic inference process. In addition;  we simulate finitely many trajectories with Chuaâ€™s circuit and infer the temporal logic formulas with the Gaussian optimization. The results show that the proposed method can find a temporal logic formula to detect the faulty trajectory with a probability guarantee. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
