In this article;  a scalable autonomous separation assurance framework is proposed for high-density en route airspace sectors with heterogeneous aircraft objectives. To handle the complex dynamic decision making under uncertainty;  multi-agent reinforcement learning is used in a decentralized approach with each aircraft being represented as an agent. Based on this;  each agent locally solves the separation assurance problem;  allowing the framework to scale to a large number of aircraft. In addition;  each agent has the ability to learn the intention of the intruder aircraft;  which is essential in environments with heterogeneous agents. Numerical experiments are performed in a real-time air traffic simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to effectively ensure the safe separation of heterogeneous agents;  while also optimizing the intrinsic agent objectives in high-density en route airspace sectors. In addition;  the efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated and shown to provide real-time decision making for separation assurance.
