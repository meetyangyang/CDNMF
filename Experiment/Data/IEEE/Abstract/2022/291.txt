For nearly a decade;  quality-related fault detection algorithms have been widely used in industrial systems. However;  the majority of these detection strategies rely on static assumptions of the operating environment. In this paper;  taking the time series of variables into consideration;  a dynamic kernel entropy component regression (DKECR) framework is proposed to address the instability of quality-related fault detection due to the existing dynamic characteristics. Compared with the typical kernel entropy component analysis method;  the proposed method constructs the relationship between process states and quality states to further interpret the direct effect on the product taken by the fault. In the proposed approach;  process measurements are converted to a lower-dimensional subspace with a specific angular structure that is more comprehensive than traditional subspace approaches. In addition;  the angular statistics and their relevant thresholds are exploited to enhance the quality-related fault detection performance. Finally;  the proposed method will be compared with three methods by means of a numerical example and two industrial scenarios to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.
