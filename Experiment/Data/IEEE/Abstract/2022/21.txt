Monitoring topographic variations in the engineered surface is crucial for quality engineers since the change in the surface finish is closely related to the performance of products. However;  several challenging issues such as the existence of spatial autocorrelation within the surface;  and changes of topographic features such as position and shape of peaks and valleys across defect-free surfaces make it difficult to monitor variations in the surface. In addition;  existing monitoring approaches fail to detect local changes in the surface. In this article;  we present a new approach for monitoring topographic variations in surfaces. We develop a residual-based separation deviation (RBSD) model to effectively identify local surface changes. Residuals are obtained through the fit surface prediction model;  which characterizes the generic behavior of defect-free surfaces;  and binarized by the RBSD model to distinguish the defective region where residuals are autocorrelated. A spatial randomness-based monitoring statistic is introduced to evaluate binary patterns in order to detect surface anomalies. Numerical simulation and a case study of the coated paper surface monitoring are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
