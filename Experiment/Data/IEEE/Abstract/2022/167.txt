Microswimmer and miniswimmer toward precision-targeted medicine have attracted extensive attention recently. We have developed an autonomous manipulation approach for magnetic-driven helical miniswimmer at low Reynolds number in the horizontal plane (\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$H$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-plane). Different from our previous work which just makes the barycenter of miniswimmer on the reference path as well as takes the swimming direction not into consideration in planar path following;  our control policy in this article can make the miniswimmer to follow the reference path and;  at the same time;  its swimming direction is also along the reference path. A robust tracking method is employed to locate the helical miniswimmer in real time. Due to different external disturbances;  an angle compensating model in the global coordinate frame is developed by radial basis function (RBF) networks trained by backpropagation algorithms;  which is used to express the swimming model of the helical miniswimmer facing the gravity and lateral disturbances. A discrete-time optimal controller is formulated based on the linear-quadratic feedback control. Simulations and experiments are conducted to quantitatively validate the autonomous manipulation;  and the results show the control performance with submillimeter accuracy in the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$H$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-plane. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
