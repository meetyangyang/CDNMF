In large-scale industrial applications;  goods must be continuously transported between locations;  which in the absence of conveyor systems is by a fleet of individual vehicles. This article introduces flow-achieving scheduling tree (FAST);  an online dispatching algorithm that allows vehicles to efficiently operate as a team to maximize the systemâ€™s throughput while meeting a production schedule. A high-performance model is developed for high-fidelity prediction of vehicle interactions and system performance. It is subsequently optimized using a self-tuning variant of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to make agile dispatch decisions in real time. The method is validated using an open-cut mine site and is shown to outperform a commonly used algorithm in this domain. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
