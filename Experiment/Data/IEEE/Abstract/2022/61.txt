Multiagent dynamic task assignment of forest fires is a complicated optimization problem because it requires the consideration of multiple factors;  such as the spread speed of fires;  firefighting speed of agents;  the movement speed of agents;  and the number of deployed agents. In this article;  we investigate multiagent dynamic task assignment based on a forest fire point model;  the objective of which is to minimize task completion time. First;  we establish a model for the spread of fire and dynamic task assignments. Second;  we prove that the optimal static task assignment always makes all task completion times the same under certain assumptions. Furthermore;  we calculate the optimal solution to the static task assignment problem assuming no travel time for the agents;  which provides the theoretical basis for the initial deployment and dynamic deployment. Third;  we propose a dynamic task assignment scheme based on the global information;  which ensures that every reassignment reduces the task completion time and makes all task completion times close to each other. Finally;  the simulation is carried out on the MATLAB platform to verify the performance of the proposed dynamic task assignment scheme by comparing with a multistage global auction algorithm. We hope that this work provides insight for decision-makers designing reasonable assignment strategies based on the model and solving assignment optimization problem in different situations. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
