Industrial parks are regarded as a possible fashion to reduce the manufacturing costs and increase the efficiency by sharing cost-effective infrastructure and communal services. However;  the waste of manufacturing resources could impede the development of manufacturing enterprises that locate in an industrial park when market demands fluctuate dynamically. This article aims to use the cloud manufacturing (CMfg) to relieve the temporary shortage of manufacturing resources and capabilities by sharing them among these enterprises in an industrial park. This article focuses on manufacturing cloud service allocation (MCSA);  which is one of the critical processes to implement CMfg. Two multiunit double auction mechanisms are proposed to allocate the manufacturing cloud services (MCSs) with reasonable trade price in bilateral markets;  and their properties and bidding strategies are proved. Numerical studies are conducted;  and the results show the effectiveness and efficiency of two mechanisms for dealing with MCSA and verify the theoretical proofs.
