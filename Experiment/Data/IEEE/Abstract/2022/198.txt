This article discusses cooperative control of a mobile dual flexible manipulator system with asymmetric time-varying output constraints and actuator failures. The shift function and a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) are used to guarantee output constraints when the initial states of the system violate the prescribed constraints. Moreover;  an adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to deal with actuator failures;  while suppressing systemâ€™s vibration and achieving cooperative operation. Finally;  theoretic analysis proves the uniform bounded stability of the system and numerical simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed control method.
