The outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 has dramatically changed the world and has been a severe health threat in 2020 and 2021. In this article;  an agent-based simulation model of pedestrian dynamics is proposed for classroom-type indoor spaces (e.g.;  classroom;  auditorium;  food court;  and meeting room);  which will help organizations such as universities to evaluate alternative policies (namely entrance and exit policy;  seating policy;  and room layout) concerning the contact-caused risk associated with activities in such places during a pandemic situation. In particular;  the proposed work focuses on solving the indoor seat allocation and traffic movement problem while practicing appropriate physical distancing measures. The proposed seating policy evaluates the distance of a seat from the doors and pathways facilitating the evaluation of contact-caused risk associated with the pathway and indoor area movement. Various statistics from two perspectives;  risk;  and logistics;  are reported in the simulation results. The risk metrics used in evaluating different policies include average exposure duration and an average number of contacts with others. To develop a highly realistic crowd simulation considering physical distancing and human intervention nature;  deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms are incorporated. From this study;  it has been observed that the proposed social distancing (SD) seating policy and zonal exit policy can significantly reduce the contact number and exposure duration at a higher occupancy level. The proposed work helps the organizational policymakers to evaluate different policies and ensure the safe operation of the organizations under pandemic situations. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
