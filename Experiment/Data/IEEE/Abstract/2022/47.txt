The goal of this work is to investigate the system configuration and information management of primary care delivery with electronic visits (e-visits). We consider a medical institution employing primary care physicians and other clinicians that offer office visits (in-person) and e-visits (through secure messaging from patient portals);  and where different queue-joining behaviors: denoted as the mixed strategy;  the duplication strategy and the threshold strategy are adopted by flexible patients based on different system configurations. Different queueing models are developed to capture flexible patientsâ€™ queue-joining behaviors according to queueing information provision. In particular;  we develop the equilibrium behavior of a dual server system where state information is available for one of the servers and the flexible patient exhibits a utility-maximizing behavior;  which extends the literature on the analysis of queueing systems with strategic customers. The duplication strategy with deletion offers the least expected waiting time for the patients;  and the threshold strategy provides the next best performance which is superior to the mixed strategy;  which demonstrates the value of information. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
