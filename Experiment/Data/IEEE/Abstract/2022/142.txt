To monitor the degradation status of units and prevent unexpected failures in engineering systems;  health index (HI)-based data fusion technologies have been rapidly developed by combining multiple sensor signals;  which are helpful to understand the degradation processes of units and predict their remaining useful lifetime (RUL). Although promising;  existing HI-based data fusion models for degradation modeling are still limited due to the restrictive assumptions made during the fusion or the degradation modeling processes;  e.g.;  assuming the fusion model as a linear or kernel-based function from multiple sensor signals;  or modeling the degradation process by a preselected basis function. Such assumptions are often invalid in industrial practice and may fail to accurately characterize the complicated relationships between multiple sensor signals and the underlying degradation process. To address the issue;  this article proposes a generic indirect deep learning method that constructs an HI by combining multiple sensor signals to better characterize the degradation process. In particular;  our innovative idea is to seamlessly integrate a deep neural network (DNN) and a long short term memory (LSTM) model to construct the HI by fusing multiple sensor signals and characterize the degradation process;  which can be applied to the degradation modeling of various engineering systems. Domain knowledge including the concept of failure threshold and monotonicity of the degradation process is also considered to enhance the interpretability of the proposed method. For parameter estimation;  we develop an indirect gradient descent (IGD) algorithm to train the proposed method. Simulation studies and a case study on the degradation of aircraft gas turbine engines are presented to validate the performance of the proposed method. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
