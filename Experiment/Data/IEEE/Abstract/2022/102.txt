Accurate objective;  automated limb lameness detection and pose estimation play an important role for animal well-being and precision livestock farming. We present a wearable sensor-based limb lameness detection and pose estimation for horse walk and trot locomotion. The gait event and lameness detection are first built on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. Its outcomes are used in the limb pose estimation. A learned low-dimensional motion manifold is parameterized by a phase variable with a Gaussian process dynamic model. We compare the RNN-LSTM-based lameness detection method with a feature-based multi-layer classifier (MLC) and a multi-class classifier (MCC) that are built on support vector machine/K-nearest-neighbors and deep convolutional neural network methods;  respectively. Experimental results show that using only accelerometer measurements;  the RNN-LSTM-based approach achieves 95% lameness detection accuracy and also outperforms the feature-based MLC or MCC in terms of several assessment criteria. The pose estimation scheme can predict the 24 limb joint angles in the sagittal plane with average errors less than 5 and 10 degs under normal and induced lameness conditions;  respectively. The presented work demonstrate the successful use of machine learning techniques for high performance lameness detection and pose estimation in equine science. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
