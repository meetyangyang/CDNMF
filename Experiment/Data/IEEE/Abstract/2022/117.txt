While job scheduling problems have been studied extensively;  scheduling problems with endogenous yield rates that may be affected by predictive maintenance is not thoroughly investigated. In this study;  we consider the optimization of a joint predictive maintenance and job scheduling problem for the minimization of total shortage penalty. As maintenance may be conducted to raise machine yield rates;  machine production rates and job processing times become endogenous;  and the optimization problem is different from traditional scheduling problems. We formulate a mixed integer program for this problem and develop a heuristic algorithm based on Tabu search. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical experiments and a way of estimating the yield declining rate with industry defect and maintenance records. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
