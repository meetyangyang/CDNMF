This study aims at developing and evaluating an affordable and user-friendly motion capture system for human upper limbs’ joint kinematics estimation. The objective is to provide quantitative assessments during the clinical evaluation of poststroke patients performing daily living activities. The proposed system is based on the simultaneous use of affordable inertial measurement units;  and a set of augmented reality markers tracked with an affordable RGB camera. Two practical calibration processes were developed to calibrate the sensors modules and then to determine their location on body segments. Then;  all measured quantities were fused into a constrained extended Kalman filter based on an upper limbs’ biomechanical model. The proposed system was validated with nine healthy volunteers performing five daily living activities. Joint angles estimated using the proposed affordable system were compared with a gold standard stereophotogrammetric system. The results showed a low average rms difference (2.7°) along with a high average correlation (0.87).
