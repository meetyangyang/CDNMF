This article proposes a risk assessment method based on interval intuitionistic integrated cloud Petri net (IIICPN). The cloud model is widely used in data mining and knowledge discovery;  especially in risk assessment problems with linguistic variables. However;  the cloud models proposed in the literature do not express interval-valued intuitionistic linguistic satisfactorily;  and the reasoning methods based on the cloud models cannot perform risk assessment well. The work in this article includes the definition of IIIC and IIICPN;  the method of converting the interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic numbers into IIIC;  and the reasoning method of IIICPN. As proofs;  a subway fire accident model is adopted to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method;  and comparison experiments between the IIICPN with general fuzzy Petri net and the trapezium cloud model are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed model.
