In the past decade;  there is an increasing interest in the deployment of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for undertaking ocean missions in dynamic;  complex maritime environments. The success of these missions largely relies on motion planning algorithms that can generate optimal navigational trajectories to guide a USV. Apart from minimising the distance of a path;  when deployed a USVsâ€™ motion planning algorithms also need to consider other constraints such as energy consumption;  the affected of ocean currents as well as the fast collision avoidance capability. In this paper;  we propose a new algorithm named anisotropic GPMP2 to revolutionise motion planning for USVs based upon the fundamentals of GP (Gaussian process) motion planning (GPMP;  or its updated version GPMP2). Firstly;  we integrated the anisotropy into GPMP2 to make the generated trajectories follow ocean currents where necessary to reduce energy consumption on resisting ocean currents. Secondly;  to further improve the computational speed and trajectory quality;  a dynamic fast GP interpolation is integrated in the algorithm. Finally;  the new algorithm has been validated on a WAM-V 20 USV in a ROS environment to show the practicability of anisotropic GPMP2.
