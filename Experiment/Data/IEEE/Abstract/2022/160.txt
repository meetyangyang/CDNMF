Computer vision systems have become a key element of modern companies. However;  its implantation not only requires specialized hardware components but also software to control the correct performance of all these components. The purpose of this article is to present the design and deployment of a software created to manage the different computer vision systems of any company. First;  using our experience in mechanization and industrialization of company processes;  a general company specification will be proposed as well as the main software requirements that have to be satisfied. Then;  a three-level modular design composed of the core;  a configuration module;  and user interfaces with functionalities capable of satisfying the defined requirements will be presented. Special attention will be given to time restrictions and componentsâ€™ synchronization. In addition;  the different tests that have been carried out to control the correct performance of the software will be shown. The development process will end with a generic;  modular;  and scalable software able to fit different industrial scenarios by simply modifying a set of input parameters. To illustrate the correct performance of the proposal;  the details of its installation in four real companies with different needs will be presented. The proposed work has a practical use in industry and it also provides a thorough description of the main components involved in computer vision systems of real company environments and how to manage them. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
