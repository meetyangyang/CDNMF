In offshore maritime operations;  automated systems capable of maintaining the vesselâ€™s position and heading using its own propellers and thrusters to compensate exogenous disturbances;  like wind;  waves;  and currents;  are referred to as marine dynamic positioning (DP) systems. DP systems play a central role in several marine operations;  such as drilling;  pipe-laying;  coring;  and ocean observation. These operations are the primary cause of fuel consumption;  having a strong impact on the overall footprint of the vessel. For this reason;  we will face the problem of optimal thrust allocation of an over-actuated vessel to maintain position and heading with minimal fuel consumption. State-of-the-art approaches simplify this problem by roughly approximating it and obtain a simple;  mostly convex;  optimization problem that can be solved in near-real time by the automation system. In this article;  we improve current approaches with the following contributions. We will exploit a higher fidelity representation of the physical system;  and we will manipulate the resulting optimization problem accordingly;  to allow for near-real-time solutions on conventional computing platforms on-board. We evaluate the quality of the proposal with a case study on a drilling unit equipped with six thrusters. The results will show that it is possible to achieve up to 5% of fuel savings with respect to conventional approaches.
