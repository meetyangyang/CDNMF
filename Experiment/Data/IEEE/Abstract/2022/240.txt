This article addresses a new cooperative localization problem for a team of mobile robots subject to limited communication resources. First;  we develop a decentralized event-triggered cooperative localization (DECL) algorithm for multirobot system such that each robot localizes itself with minimum communication exchange between robots. Then;  using an event-triggered mechanism we propose an optimization framework to achieve a balance between estimation performance and communication rate. Simulation results show the main benefits of the event-triggered mechanism. Also;  experimental results using four e-puck2 mobile robots demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
