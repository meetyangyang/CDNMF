The work is inspired by the assembly of Soma block puzzles. Soma block puzzles usually include unstable intermediate states that require additional support to maintain stability temporarily. In the puzzlesâ€™ solution manual, we can observe that designers consider the characteristics that humans have two hands and can avoid an unstable intermediate state by using one hand to support the finished component and using the other hand to assemble an upcoming workpiece. Motivated by human behavior, this paper develops a planner that automatically finds an optimal assembly sequence for a dual-arm robot to build a woodblock structure while considering various constraints and supporting grasps from a second hand. It uses the mesh model of wood blocks and the final assembly state to generate possible assembly sequences and evaluate the optimal assembly sequence by considering the stability, graspability, assemblability, and the need for a second hand. Especially, the need for a second hand is resolved when supports from worktables and other workpieces are not enough to produce a stable assembly. A second hand can hold and support the unstable components so that the robot can further assemble new workpieces until the structure state becomes stable again. The output of the planner includes the optimal assembly orders, candidate grasps, assembly directions, and the supporting grasps (if needed). The output can help guide a dual-arm robot to perform motion planning and thus generate assembly motion. Experiments using various blocks and structures show the effectiveness of the proposed planner.
