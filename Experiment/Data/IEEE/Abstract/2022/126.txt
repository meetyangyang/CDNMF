Quality control in industry involves trained operators to manipulate and inspect metallic surfaces in order to identify, and eventually correct, manufacturing defects. These tasks are manually performed, and a poor performance ( e.g. , missing defects) leads to an increase of the costs and prolongation of the manufacturing time cycle. In this work, we propose a multi-agent robotic platform to autonomously perform Industry 4.0 quality control processes of metallic surfaces. The platform consists of three anthropomorphic robots with custom-made end-effectors designed to manipulate, inspect, and eventually correct a metallic frame of a motorcycle. The description of a novel multi-agent platform is followed by the presentation of the developed inspection procedure, in which a linear laser scanner is used to reconstruct the three-dimensional metallic surface of a motorcycle with a resolution of ~0.1 mm. In order to validate the platform, we perform a set of experiments to assess the performance of the robotic platform in a real Industry 4.0 scenario. Results confirmed that such a system guarantees a sub-millimetric precision to identify defects on complex-shaped metallic surfaces and effectively correct them. The proposed robotic platform can be adopted for overcoming the drawbacks of a traditional procedure that relies on visual-tactile manual defects correction ( e.g. , low-repeatability, high-subjectivity) and is scalable to different industrial applications. The proposed approach aims to elevate the role of operators to expert supervisors of the process, limiting the interactions with potentially-dangerous tools/procedures and thus improving the working conditions in an industrial 4.0 scenario.
