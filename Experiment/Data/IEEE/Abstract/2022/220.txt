Heterogeneous but complementary sources of data provide an unprecedented opportunity for developing accurate statistical models of systems. Although the existing methods have shown promising results;  they are mostly applicable to situations where the system output is measured in its complete form. In reality;  however;  it may not be feasible to obtain the complete output measurement of a system;  which results in observations that contain missing values. This article introduces a general framework that integrates tensor regression with tensor completion and proposes an efficient optimization framework that alternates between two steps for parameter estimation. Through multiple simulations and a case study;  we evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results indicate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to a benchmark.
