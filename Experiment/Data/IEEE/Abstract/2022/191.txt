Most real-world networks are time-varying;  and many are subject to the stochastic functioning of their nodes and edges. Examples can be seen in the human brain undergoing an epileptic seizure;  spontaneous infection and recovery in epidemics;  and intermittent functioning of devices in the Internet of Things. Moreover;  such networks are becoming increasingly large due to rapid technological advances. However;  little has been done to study time-varying;  large-scale;  stochastic networks (SNs) from a reliability engineering perspective. Toward this goal;  this article develops a fault-tolerance model for a type of time-varying network in which nodes (and/or edges) stochastically switch between active and inactive states. It considers fault tolerance from a global connectivity point of view;  which has applications in many natural and engineered networks. Specifically;  this article presents a Markov chain framework that models the dynamic behavior of nodes and allows for the computation of quantitative measures;  including availability and time-to-failure metrics. To accommodate large-scale networks and emphasize global connectivity;  this framework utilizes percolation theory;  which has recently been of interest in the reliability engineering discipline;  to characterize network failure. This article makes several contributions: it proposes a Markov chain framework for computing fault-tolerance metrics that is tractable for large-scale networks;  it shows the existence of a phase transition in network availability of a time-varying SN;  and it accounts for finite-size effects of percolation in the fault-tolerance model. The proposed methodology is applied to Erdös–Rényi random graphs and a real;  large-scale power grid. Experimental results provide insights into network design;  maintenance;  and failure prevention of time-varying SNs. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
