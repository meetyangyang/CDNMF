The studies of Unmanned Air/Ground Vehicle (UAV/UGV) cooperative detection systems have received much attention due to their wide applications in the disaster rescue;  target tracking;  intelligent surveillance;  and automatical package delivery missions. UAVs provide a broad view and have a fast speed in the air;  while UGVs have sufficient load capacity and can serve as repeater stations on the ground. The path planning of a UAV/UGV cooperative system is an important but difficult issue;  which aims to plan paths for both the UAVs and the UGVs in the system to cooperatively complete a mission. In this article;  we consider the path planning problem of the UAV/UGV cooperative system for illegal urban building detection;  by taking the limits of UGV speed;  UAV load power;  and UAV/UGV communication restriction into consideration. To solve this problem;  we first model the path planning problem as a constraint optimization problem which tries to minimize an overall execution time for completing the illegal urban building detection tasks;  and then propose a two-level memetic algorithm (called Two-MA) to solve the path planning problems of both the UAV and the UGV. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets show the superiority of the proposed Two-MA over several states-of-the-art algorithms in solving the path planning problems of the UAV and UGV for illegal urban building detection tasks.
