For fault classification in industrial processes;  both inaccurate and incomplete supervised information commonly exist in practice;  which raise a big challenge to the research field. In this article;  a weakly supervised form of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is proposed;  with considerations of both inaccurate and incomplete labels in fault classification. First;  a label probability transition matrix is used to describe the relationship between the inaccurate labels and unknown true labels of process data. This transition matrix is estimated through a Gaussian mixture model;  and then used to correct the loss function of the MLP model. Based on the framework of the developed weakly supervised MLP (WS-MLP) model;  the information of incomplete labels in the training data set is incorporated simultaneously with the inaccurate label information. The performance of the proposed model WS-MLP is evaluated through two industrial benchmark data sets;  results of which indicate its effectiveness under different application cases. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
