Inspecting large-scale physical infrastructure assets such as powerlines from the air involves capturing data of thousands of features of an asset and its nearby surroundings;  which makes inspection flight planning challenging. The objective of this article is to address the problems of automatically generating and optimizing flight paths and mission plans for airborne inspection of large linear infrastructure assets. This article proposes an automated feature-driven flight planning method using metaheuristic optimization with consideration of aircraft dynamic;  sensor;  terrain;  and airfield location constraints. Results for flight planning the inspection of one of the worldâ€™s largest above-ground powerline networks are shown. Automated planning can reduce the human planning workload and enable the cost-saving benefits of automated aircraft to be realized through efficient deployment. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
