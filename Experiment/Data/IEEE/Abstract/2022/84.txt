Cloud platforms have recently become a popular target execution environment for numerous workflow applications. Hence;  effective workflow scheduling strategies in cloud environments are in high demand. However;  existing scheduling algorithms are grounded on an idealized target platform model where virtual machines are fully connected;  and all communications can be performed concurrently. A significant aspect neglected by them is endpoint communication contention when executing workflows;  which has a large impact on workflow makespan. This article investigates how to incorporate contention awareness into cloud workflow scheduling and proposes a new practical scheduling model. Endpoint communication contention-aware List Scheduling Heuristic (ELSH) is designed to minimize workflow makespan. It uses a novel task ranking property and schedules data communications to communication resources besides scheduling tasks to computing resources. Moreover;  a rescheduling technique is employed to improve the schedule. In experiments;  ELSH is evaluated against the traditional contention-oblivious list scheduling algorithm;  which is adapted to address contention during execution in practice. The experimental results reveal that ELSH performs more efficaciously compared with the adapted traditional ones. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
