Making rapid decisions in intervention resource planning is crucial for mitigating morbidity;  mortality;  and costs to the societies during epidemic outbreaks. This study presents a data-driven optimization approach for multiperiod resources planning;  based on a sequential decision framework;  considering up-to-date information and uncertainty in the spread of epidemics. In this method;  a new \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$SEI^{3}H^{2}RD$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n spread model is constructed to generate the most potential scenarios of an epidemic;  based on all the historical information;  and risk-averse stochastic programming was proposed to arrive at an optimal resource planning solution. The data-based numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach could control the epidemic by reducing the infected cases and deaths with similar or fewer resources than in the reality. In addition;  we also find that the risk-averse design of the objective was able to take a steadier approach to resource planning helped avoid large fluctuations in resource allocations compared to a risk-neutral design. The other insight obtained from these experiments was that a moderate decision interval along with a planning horizon;  which is slightly larger than the decision interval;  would be a good choice for the sequential planning problem. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
