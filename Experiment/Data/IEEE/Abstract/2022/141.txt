This study develops a novel data-driven latent variable correlation analysis (LVCA) framework to achieve communication efficient distributed monitoring for industrial plant-wide processes. Process data of a local unit are first projected into a dominant latent variable subspace and a residual subspace to characterize the correlation within the local unit. Then;  least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is used to determine communication variables from neighboring units that are beneficial for monitoring the local unit. Thereafter;  canonical correlation analysis is performed between the dominant subspace and communication variables to characterize the correlation between units. Finally;  a distributed monitor is established for each unit;  which considers the correlation within the local unit and the correlation between different operation units. The proposed LVCA-based distributed monitoring scheme is applied on a numerical example;  the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process;  and a lab-scale distillation process. Comparison results with some state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
