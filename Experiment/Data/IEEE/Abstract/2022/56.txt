A dynamic self-assembly is a promising approach for inducing the collective behavior of agents to perform coordinated tasks at small scales. However;  efficient pattern formation and navigation in environments with complex conditions remain a challenge. In this article;  we propose a strategy for micromanipulation using dynamically self-assembled magnetic droplets with needle guidance. An iron needle was controlled by a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) manipulator and magnetized by precessing magnetic fields. The process of self-assembly was optimized based on real-time vision feedback and a genetic algorithm. Affected by the locally induced field gradient near the needle;  reconfigurable assembled magnetic droplets were formed beneath the air-liquid interface with high time efficiency;  and the geometric center of the pattern was determined. Following the magnetized needle;  assembled patterns were navigated along preplanned paths and exhibited reversible pattern expansion and shrinkage. Moreover;  cargo can be trapped and caged by exploiting the induced fluid flow around the assembled droplets. To perform cargo transportation tasks in a multiple-obstacle environment;  an optimal path planner with obstacle-avoidance capability was designed based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrated effective pattern formation;  navigation;  cargo trapping;  and obstacle-avoidance transportation. The proposed method opens new prospects of using a dynamically self-assembled pattern as an untethered end-effector for micromanipulation. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
