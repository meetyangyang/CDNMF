This article proposes an original approach for robotic calibration that is based on measurements along a single direction (1-D). Among all applications;  the field of microrobotics and nanorobotics has been chosen as case study because of the strong needs for high positioning accuracy (10–100 nm typically) while measuring with sufficient resolution along multi-degrees of freedom (DoF) is still a fully open question. The 1-D measurements relying on Fabry–Perot (FP) interferences is used;  and the proposed modeling of a 6-DoF nanopositioning robot enables to derive the measurement strategy as well as the identification procedure for both extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. Experimental investigations demonstrate that the approach is easy to implement;  low cost;  and enables to understand what are the main influential parameters onto positioning accuracy. They also conduct to very high accuracy in 6-DoF positioning; a positioning accuracy estimate of 50 nm and 0.004° has notably been obtained for the full pose (position and orientation;  respectively) and can be held during several hours after the measurements.
