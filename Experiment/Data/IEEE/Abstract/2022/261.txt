Mobile robots are expected to move safely and efficiently in socially-compliant ways in dense crowds. In this paper;  a unified multiple-motion-mode framework is proposed to achieve socially-compliant navigation in dense crowds. The proposed framework consists of three successive phases;  the identification of pedestrian groups and prediction of their trajectories;  the generation of candidate local trajectories of the robot;  and the determination of an optimal local trajectory. The pedestrians are grouped according to distances among pedestrians and their velocities and a predictor predicts the groupsâ€™ trajectories. Three robot motion modes;  moving-solo;  pedestrian-following;  and courteous-stopping;  are proposed based on a systematic analysis and classification of dense crowds and they are utilized to generate candidate local trajectories. A composite metric is proposed to determine the best local trajectory by simultaneously considering the robot motion safety;  efficiency;  and stability of the trajectory. The proposed robot navigation framework is evaluated both in simulations and real-world experiments with various scenarios. The results show that the proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and social compliance.
