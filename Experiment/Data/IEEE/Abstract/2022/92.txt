Elderly fall prevention and detection becomes extremely crucial with the fast aging population globally. In this article;  we propose \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>mmFall</i>\n;  a novel fall detection system;  which comprises 1) the emerging millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor to collect the human body’s point cloud along with the body centroid and 2) a hybrid variational recurrent neural network (RNN) autoencoder (HVRAE) to compute the anomaly level of the body motion based on the acquired point cloud. A fall is detected when the spike in anomaly level and the drop in centroid height occur simultaneously. The mmWave radar sensor offers privacy-compliance and high sensitivity to motion;  over the traditional sensing modalities. However;  1) randomness in radar point cloud and 2) difficulties in fall collection/labeling in the traditional supervised fall detection approaches are the two major challenges. To overcome the randomness in radar data;  the proposed HVRAE uses variational inference;  a generative approach rather than a discriminative approach;  to infer the posterior probability of the body’s latent motion state every frame;  followed by a RNN to summarize the temporal features over multiple frames. Moreover;  to circumvent the difficulties in fall data collection/labeling;  the HVRAE is built upon an autoencoder architecture in a semisupervised approach;  which is only trained on the normal activities of daily living (ADL). In the inference stage;  the HVRAE will generate a spike in the anomaly level once an abnormal motion;  such as fall;  occurs. During the experiment; \n<xref ref-type=\fn\ rid=\fn1\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><sup>1</sup></xref>\n we implemented the HVRAE along with two other baselines;  and tested on the data set collected in an apartment. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicates that our proposed model outperforms baselines and achieves 98% detection out of 50 falls at the expense of just 2 false alarms. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
