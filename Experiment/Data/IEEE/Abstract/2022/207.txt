This paper presents an event-triggered model predictive control (MPC) strategy with learning terminal cost for robotic manipulators containing model uncertainty and input constraints. In the proposed MPC structure;  an adaptive predictive model for the robotic system is established by radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) firstly. Then;  a terminal cost adjusted by the global learning mechanism is constructed. Both global steady-state optimization and transient fast convergence are achieved by adding the learning terminal cost to the MPC scheme. After that;  a triggering condition of the MPC solving is developed based on the predictive modelâ€™s weights and the predictive tracking error. Besides;  the condition to avoid Zeno behavior is obtained. The recursive feasibility of the proposed MPC strategy is verified;  and the ultimately uniformly boundedness (UUB) of all variables is proved according to the Lyapunov theorem. Finally;  experiments based on an xMate7 Pro robot are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.
