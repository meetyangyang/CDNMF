We propose a computational model for enabling robots to automatically make decisions under risk in a human-like way. Human decision-making (DM) under risk is influenced by psychological effects;  including regret effects;  probability weighting effects;  and range effects. On the basis of regret theory;  we devise a mathematical DM model to encompass these psychological effects. To further quantify the model;  we cast the model into a state-space representation and design a fuzzy logic controller to obtain desired preference data from individual decision makers. The data from each individual were used to train a personalized instance of the model. The resulting model is quantitative. It sheds light on the psychological mechanism of risk-attitudes in human DM. The prediction accuracy of the model was statistically tested. On average;  the accuracy of our model is 74.7%;  which is significantly close to the average accuracy of the subjects when they repeated their own previously made decisions (73.3%). Furthermore;  when only the decisions that were repeated consistently by the subjects are examined;  the average accuracy of our model is 86.6%. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
