This article focuses on individualized degradation modeling and prognostics for a heterogeneous group;  where each individual unit shows a distinct degradation process. Existing degradation models usually treat each unit separately and do not fully utilize the distinct characteristics of each individual. In this study;  we propose a generic framework to handle the heterogeneity across units by effectively leveraging the intrinsic covariate information;  which is closely related to the unit’s degradation process. Specifically;  we employ a multivariate Gaussian process (MGP) to nonparametrically establish the relation between the covariate information and degradation process. Through modeling the unit similarities based on the covariates;  efficient information transfer among units is enabled for better degradation modeling and prognostics;  as the collected degradation signals from one unit can be shared with the entire heterogeneous group. A theoretical justification for the proposed model is also investigated. Simulation studies are presented to evaluate the parameter estimation accuracy and the sensitivity of the proposed method. A case study on the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuroimaging initiative data set is further conducted;  which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed method over existing benchmark approaches. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
