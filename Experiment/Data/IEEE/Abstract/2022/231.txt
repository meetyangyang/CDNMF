The key concept of collaborative robotics is represented by the presence of a strict interaction between a human user and the robotic system. As such;  the study of the interaction is of paramount importance for a successful implementation of the system. In this article;  we propose a novel approach to address the problem of designing a collaborative robotic system for industrial applications;  focusing on the characteristics of the interaction. In particular;  we will propose a set of methodologies focused on interaction design;  inspired by those used for the design of user interfaces. These methodologies will allow the design of collaborative robotic systems following a user-centered approach;  thus putting emphasis not only on safety and adaptability of the robotic systems (which have been widely addressed in the literature);  but also on the interaction experience. While the proposed methodology was developed considering general collaborative robotics applications;  two real industrial case studies were considered;  to instantiate the considered framework and showcase its applicability to the real-world domain.
