Multivariate time series (MTS) arise due to multisensor data collection in manufacturing. These data are complex in the sense that attributes have a varying scale;  volitivity;  continuity;  and so on;  and interattribute dependence also appears;  which can mask the inherent information about system health status. Conventional machine learning-based process monitoring techniques are inefficient in predicting faults with MTSâ€”their detection capability heavily relies on the input features;  yet the classification power of MTS attributes is weakened by the complexity of multisensor data. Effective feature extraction is;  therefore;  necessary to facilitate fault prediction with MTS. This study proposes a fault prediction framework for MTS based on bag-of-words (BOW) feature extraction;  statistical feature selection;  and classification analysis. BOW models are for the first time adopted in a manufacturing context. Their superior capability in information preservation;  local pattern recognition;  and temporal effect accommodation has overcome the major limitations in current manufacturing practices with MTS. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the desirable performance of this framework on two MTS data sets from paper manufacturing and automotive manufacturing;  as well as its superiority over conventional machine learning-based fault prediction.
