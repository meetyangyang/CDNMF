Production systems include both discrete part and batch operations;  where an individual part is manufactured in a discrete operation;  and a group of parts are processed simultaneously;  i.e.;  in a batch;  on one machine for a batch operation. Many manufacturing industries;  such as battery;  aircraft;  and automotive;  consist of mixed batch and discrete part operations;  referred to as batch-discrete lines. Although such operations are widely encountered;  analytical studies of these systems are limited in current literature. In this paper;  a systems approach is presented to model and analyze batch-discrete lines. First;  a Bernoulli machine reliability model for a two-machine batch-discrete system is introduced. Using a virtual buffer to represent the batch processing feature;  performance evaluation formulae are derived and system properties are investigated. Using them;  improvement analyses and bottleneck identification are presented. Then;  the model is extended to systems with a quality inspection device under different control policies. To illustrate the applicability of the model;  a case study in a composite part production process is described. Such a work delivers a quantitative tool for production engineers and managers to design;  analyze;  and improve batch-discrete manufacturing systems. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
