Navigation control of microrobots in vivo has great potential in precision medicine and has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The control performance of the existing methods is considerably affected by hysteresis nonlinearity. This article presents a robust control method that can overcome hysteresis influence in navigating a microrobot actuated by an electromagnetic coil system. A motion planner that combines the breadth-first search (BFS) method and genetic algorithm (GA) is used to plan a reliable and flexible trajectory for the microrobot navigation. To compensate for hysteresis nonlinearity existing in the system;  the Prandtlâ€“Ishlinskii (PI) model is introduced. A robust controller that integrates adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) and nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to guarantee the stability and accuracy of the microrobot in motion. Experiments have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The success of this research will advance the microrobot navigation for in vivo applications.
