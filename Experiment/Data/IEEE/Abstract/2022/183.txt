The development of industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) provides a tight connection between the digital model and the industrial physical plant;  which enables to use the data-driven methods to reflect the state of process running in the real world. However;  due to the noisy and harsh industrial environment;  the collected data are often corrupted to some extent. If the corrupted data are not detected in time;  the data-driven model will inevitably degenerate and induce a poor process monitoring performance. In addition;  the nonlinear characteristics between process variables due to the high complexities in physical plant bring challenges to the data-driven methods. In this article;  a robust kernel dictionary learning method;  which can overcome the negative influence of outliers and simultaneously extracts the nonlinear characteristics of industrial process;  is proposed to address the above problems in ICPS. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved significantly better and stable performance to deal with outlier detection and process monitoring in ICPS. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
