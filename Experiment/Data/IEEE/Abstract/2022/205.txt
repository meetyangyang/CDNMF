The multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) formation plays an important role in underwater missions;  such as oceanographic sampling and water pollution monitoring. This article presents the mechatronic design;  modeling;  formation control;  and experiments of multiple AUVs. The structure of the AUV and a simplified mathematical model for tracking control are described. To achieve formation control;  we formulate a control framework for the multiple AUVs. The upper layer is a formation algorithm based on a novel leader-follower control law. The bottom layer is a dynamic controller based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC). The formation algorithm is in charge of calculating reference values for the followers to maintain a desired pattern with the leader. The stability and convergence properties of the algorithm have been analyzed using the Lyapunov stability method. Meanwhile;  an ADRC approach-based dynamic controller is established to track the reference values. Numerical simulations are carried out to analyze formation control and validate the control framework. The multiple AUVs can switch and maintain the formation between the one-line pattern and the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$V$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n pattern. Finally;  extensive formation field experiments involving the one-line pattern and the \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$V$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n pattern show the good motion ability of the self-designed AUVs and also verify the feasibility of the proposed control approach.
