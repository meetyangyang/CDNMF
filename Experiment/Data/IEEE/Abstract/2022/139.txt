Visualâ€“inertial odometry (VIO) is widely studied and used in autonomous robots. This article proposes a novel tightly coupled monocular VIO system based on point-line constraints (PLC-VIO). In the front end;  PLC-VIO presents a line segment extraction and merging algorithm based on the EDLines method and achieves real-time feature tracking based on the geometric constraints between feature points and lines. In the back end;  PLC-VIO reconstructs new 3-D landmarks of feature lines through points on the line and optimizes the states by minimizing a cost function that combines the preintegrated inertial measurement unit (IMU) error term together with the point and line reprojection error terms in a sliding window optimization framework. A loop closure module is also integrated;  which enables relocalization and drift elimination. The corresponding experimental evaluations are conducted using public datasets to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system;  and the results show that PLC-VIO can achieve good performance when compared with other state-of-the-art systems and;  at the same time;  with no compromise to real-time performance. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
