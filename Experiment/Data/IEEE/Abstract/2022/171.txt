Medical test selection is a recurring problem in health prevention and consists of proposing a set of tests to each subject for diagnosis and treatment of pathologies. The problem is characterized by the unknown risk probability distribution across the population and two contradictory objectives: minimizing the number of tests and giving the medical test to all at-risk populations. This article sets this problem in a general framework of chance-constrained medical test rationing with unknown subject distribution over an attribute space and unknown risk probability but with a given sample population. A new approach combining decision-tree and Bayesian inference is proposed to allocate relevant medical tests according to the subjectsâ€™ profile. Case studies on screening of hypertension and diabetes are conducted;  and the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated. Significant savings on unnecessary tests are achieved with limited numbers of subjects needing but not receiving necessary tests. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
