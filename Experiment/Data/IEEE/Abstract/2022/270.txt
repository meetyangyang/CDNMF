Despite rapid advances in machine learning based fault diagnosis;  their identical distribution assumption of the training (source domain) and testing data (target domain) is generally challenged in industrial applications due to the variation of working conditions. In this article;  a fault-prototypical adapted network (FPAN) is proposed;  which enables cross-domain industrial intelligent fault diagnosis aided by deep transfer learning. First;  a similarity learning-based discrimination module is designed to learn fault prototypes (FPs) that are representative for each fault and discriminative across different faults. Then;  a fault prototypical-adaptation module is developed;  which adapts the multiple FPs to the target dataset and enables more precise category-wise domain invariance. The two modules are trained simultaneously to extract transferrable and discriminative FPs;  by which the cross-domain intelligent diagnosis can be readily achieved. Experimental results on two industrial cases illustrate that the proposed approach learns transferable feature representations that better reduce domain discrepancy;  and provides improved diagnosis performance on target data.
