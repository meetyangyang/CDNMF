Networked microgrids that integrate the hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) with the on-site renewable energy sources (RES);  power-to-hydrogen (P2H) facilities;  and hydrogen storage could help decarbonize the energy and transportation sectors. In this paper;  to support the hydrogen-based networked microgrids planning subject to multiple uncertainties (e.g.;  RES generation;  electric loads;  and the refueling demands of hydrogen vehicles);  we propose a two-stage stochastic formulation with mixed integer conic program (MICP) recourse decisions. Our formulation involves the holistic investment and operation modeling to optimally site and configure the microgrids with HFSs. The MICP problems appearing in the second-stage capture the nonlinear power flow of networked microgrids system with binary decisions on storage charging/discharging status and energy transactions (including the trading of electricity;  hydrogen;  and carbon credits to recover the capital expenditures). To handle the computational challenges associated with the stochastic program with MICP recourse;  an augmented Benders decomposition algorithm (ABD) is developed. Numerical studies on 33- and 47-bus exemplary networks demonstrate the economics viability of electricity-hydrogen coordination on microgrids level;  as well as the benefits of stochastic modeling. Also;  our augmented algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods;  e.g.;  the progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) and the direct use of a professional MIP solver;  which has largely improved the solution quality and reduced the computation time by orders of magnitude.
