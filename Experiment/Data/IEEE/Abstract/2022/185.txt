In performance tests;  replacing humans with robotic drivers has many advantages;  such as high efficiency and high security. To realize the vehicle speed tracking control with a robotic driver;  this article proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Specifically;  the design of the approach includes state space;  action space;  reward function;  and control algorithm. Then;  to shorten the training time;  the proposed approach utilizes the basic fundamental relationship between vehicle speed and pedal opening to intervene in network exploration. Furthermore;  to solve speed fluctuations in low-speed sections;  the replay buffer is optimized by adding weighted training samples. Experiments are conducted on fifteen cars;  and results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively control the vehicle speed. Generally;  it only needs three or four episodes of training to meet the requirements. Compared with the Segment-PID method;  the proposed method has a smoother speed and fewer overbound times. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
