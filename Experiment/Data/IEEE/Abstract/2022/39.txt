Machines consume intensive energy in some production systems. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to performance analysis;  continuous improvement;  and design of production systems;  the research on reducing the energy consumption in these systems is limited. In this article;  the problem of minimizing the energy consumed by machines in the two-machine Bernoulli serial line;  which has been formulated as nonlinear programming with production rate constraint;  is investigated. Specifically;  structural characteristics and optimality conditions of the problem are analyzed;  and two nonlinear algebraic optimality equations are established. To solve the optimality equations;  their properties are explored;  and an effective algorithm based on the binary search method is developed. Furthermore;  the sensitivity of the optimal solution with respect to system parameters is quantitatively analyzed. Based on the sensitivity analysis;  some useful insights on the optimal objective value are extracted. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
