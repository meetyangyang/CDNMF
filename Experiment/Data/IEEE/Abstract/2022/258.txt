The current thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panel industry evolves in transition from volume production to customized production service as a major competition strategy. Owing to the highly mixed production type of small batch sizes and high varieties;  metrology data are usually collected too infrequently for building accurate virtual metrology (VM) models. In this paper;  a new product-to-product (P2P) VM model to predict photoresist spacer heights in the color filter process of the array sector is developed. First;  a position-based random forests model is proposed for the base product. Second;  an ensemble model combining the base model and a biased estimation random forests model for the new product of small batch size is proposed to perform P2P VM between different products on the same tool. The real datasets of photoresist spacer heights for different products are used to illustrate the accuracy of the new P2P VM framework in the experimental study.
