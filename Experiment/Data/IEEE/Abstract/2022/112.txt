Predictive Maintenance technologies are particularly appealing for Industrial Equipment producers;  as they pave the way to the selling of high added-value services and customized maintenance plans. However;  standard Predictive Maintenance approaches assume the availability of sensor measurements;  and the costs associated with adding sensors or remotely accessing sensor readings may discourage the development of such technologies. In this context;  Alarm Forecasting can be very useful as it represents a low-cost alternative or helpful support to sensor-based Predictive Maintenance. In this work;  we propose a new formulation for the Alarm Forecasting problem;  framed as a multi-label classification task. We present a novel deep learning-based approach called FORMULA (alarm FORecasting in MUlti-LAbel setting). FORMULA leverages Transformer;  a popular Neural Network architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing. To cope with alarm imbalance;  we draw inspiration from Segmentation and Object Detection. Thus;  FORMULA is trained by minimizing the Weighted Focal Loss;  which turns out to be very effective in predicting rare alarms. These alarms;  even if they are difficult to predict by nature;  often are business-critical. We assess the proposed approach on a representative real-world problem from the packaging industry. In particular;  we show that it outperforms not only classic multilabel techniques but also models based on recurrent neural networks. As regards the latter;  the proposed approach also exhibits a lower computational burden;  both in terms of training time and model size. To foster research in the field and reproducibility;  we also publicly share the alarm logs dataset and the code used to perform the experiments. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
