Recent technological advances and manufacturing paradigm evolutions in industrial settings will dramatically increase the complexity of automation control systems. Traditional solutions to the software development of low-level control kernels (e.g.;  numerical control kernel;  motion control kernel;  and real-time communication tasks) are unable to cope effectively with such complexity due to an inadequate level of abstraction and challenges for dependability. This article presents a formal semantics integrated model-driven design approach as a holistic solution. A domain-specific modeling language (DSML) is specified based on the adaption of IEC 61 499 architecture;  along with the extensions of task model;  task-to-resource allocation;  and nonfunctional specification. Both formal structural and behavioral semantics of the proposed DSML are then explicitly defined. Design-time formal verification is also achieved by automated model transformations. A metaprogrammable environment is adopted to facilitate flexible modeling;  verification;  and code generation. A case study is demonstrated on implementing a prototype computer numerical control (CNC) system using the proposed solution. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
