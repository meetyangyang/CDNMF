In this study;  we propose an efficient optimization algorithm that is a hybrid of the iterated greedy and simulated annealing algorithms (hereinafter;  referred to as IGSA) to solve the flexible job shop scheduling problem with crane transportation processes (CFJSP). Two objectives are simultaneously considered;  namely;  the minimization of the maximum completion time and the energy consumptions during machine processing and crane transportation. Different from the methods in the literature;  crane lift operations have been investigated for the first time to consider the processing time and energy consumptions involved during the crane lift process. The IGSA algorithm is then developed to solve the CFJSPs considered. In the proposed IGSA algorithm;  first;  each solution is represented by a 2-D vector;  where one vector represents the scheduling sequence and the other vector shows the assignment of machines. Subsequently;  an improved construction heuristic considering the problem features is proposed;  which can decrease the number of replicated insertion positions for the destruction operations. Furthermore;  to balance the exploration abilities and time complexity of the proposed algorithm;  a problem-specific exploration heuristic is developed. Finally;  a set of randomly generated instances based on realistic industrial processes is tested. Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analyses;  the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several efficient algorithms. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
