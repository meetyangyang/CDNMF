Due to the robustness to robot modeling and camera calibration errors and avoidance of complete target geometry;  image-based visual servoing has always been an important topic in the fields such as robotics;  computer vision and so forth. When the image information obtained by the camera is mapped to the robotic task space to design the servoing control law;  the resulting interaction matrix;  which links the spatial velocity of the camera to the temporal variation of the selected image features;  depends on the unknown feature depths. The use of inaccurate feature depths may influence the stability and robustness of the controller;  and even cause the failure of the task. In this article;  based on the perspective camera model;  by employing the principle of reduced order observer;  a novel logarithmic observer is presented for on-line recovery of feature depth. Compared with the typical observers now available;  the presented observer offers several advantages: global convergence;  a faster convergence rate of error structure than exponential error structure;  a less restricted observability condition and greater robustness against measurements with noise. The comparison results of numerical simulations indicate the superiority of the presented observer;  and real experiments with Kinect v2 sensor further validate the effectiveness of the presented observer in practical situation.
