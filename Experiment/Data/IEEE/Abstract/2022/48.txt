The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic causing millions of deaths;  devastating social and economic disruptions. Testing individuals for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2);  the pathogen of COVID-19;  is critical for mitigating and containing COVID-19. Many countries are implementing group testing strategies against COVID-19 to improve testing capacity and efficiency while saving required workloads and consumables. A group of individualsâ€™ nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab samples is mixed to conduct one test. However;  existing group testing methods neglect the fact that mixing samples usually leads to substantial dilution of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) of SARS-CoV-2;  which seriously impacts the sensitivity of tests. In this paper;  we aim to screen individuals infected with COVID-19 with as few tests as possible;  under the premise that the sensitivity of tests is high enough. To achieve this goal;  we propose an Adaptive Group Testing (AdaGT) method. By collecting information on the number of positive and negative samples that have been identified during the screening process;  the AdaGT method can estimate the ratio of positive samples in real-time. Based on this ratio;  the AdaGT algorithm adjusts its testing strategy adaptively between an individual testing strategy and a group testing strategy. The group size of the group testing strategy is carefully selected to guarantee that the sensitivity of each test is higher than a predetermined threshold and that this group contains at most one positive sample on average. Theoretical performance analysis on the AdaGT algorithm is provided and then validated in experiments. Experimental results also show that the AdaGT algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and sensitivity. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
