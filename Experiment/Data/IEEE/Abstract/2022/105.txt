The Conflict-Free Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (CF-EVRP) is an extension of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP);  a combinatorial optimization problem of designing routes for vehicles to visit customers such that a cost function;  typically the number of vehicles or the total travelled distance;  is minimized. The problem finds many logistics applications;  particularly for highly automated logistic systems for material handling. The CF-EVRP involves constraints such as time windows on the delivery to the customers;  limited operating range of the vehicles;  and limited capacity on the number of vehicles that a road segment can accommodate at the same time. In this paper;  the compositional algorithm ComSat for solving the CF-EVRP is presented. The algorithm iterates through the sub-problems until a globally feasible solution is found. The proposed algorithm is implemented using an optimizing SMT-solver and is evaluated against an implementation of a previously presented monolithic model. The soundness and completeness of the algorithm are proven;  and it is benchmarked on a set of generated problems and found to be able to solve problems of industrial size. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
