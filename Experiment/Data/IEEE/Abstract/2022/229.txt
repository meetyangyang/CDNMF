Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enable development of reconfigurable manufacturing systemsâ€”a new generation of modularized industrial equipment suitable for highly customized manufacturing. Sequential control in these systems is largely based on discrete events;  whereas their formal execution semantics is specified as control interpreted Petri nets (CIPN). Despite industry-wide use of programming languages based on the CIPN formalism;  formal verification of such control applications in the presence of adversarial activity is not supported. Consequently;  in this article;  we introduce security-aware modeling and verification techniques for CIPN-based sequential control applications. Specifically;  we show how CIPN models of networked industrial IoT controllers can be transformed into time Petri net (TPN)-based models and composed with plant and security-aware channel models in order to enable system-level verification of safety properties in the presence of network-based attacks. Additionally;  we introduce realistic channel-specific attack models that capture adversarial behavior using nondeterminism. Moreover;  we show how verification results can be utilized to introduce security patches and facilitate design of attack detectors that improve system resiliency and enable satisfaction of critical safety properties. Finally;  we evaluate our framework on an industrial case study.
