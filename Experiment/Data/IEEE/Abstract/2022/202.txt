Accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles enables lower risk path planning in advance for autonomous vehicles;  thus promising the safety of automated driving. A low-risk and high-efficiency path planning approach is proposed for autonomous driving based on the high-performance and practical trajectory prediction method. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is trained and tested using the highD dataset;  and the validated LSTM is used to predict the trajectories of surrounding vehicles combining the information extracted from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology. A risk assessment and mitigation-based local path planning algorithm is proposed according to the information of predicted trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Two driving scenarios are extracted and reconstructed from the highD dataset for validation and evaluation;  i.e.;  an active lane-change scenario and a longitudinal collision-avoidance scenario. The results illustrate that the risk is mitigated and the driving efficiency is improved with the proposed path planning algorithm comparing to the constant-velocity prediction and the prediction method of the nonlinear inputâ€“output (NIO) network;  especially when the velocity and trajectory with sudden changes.
