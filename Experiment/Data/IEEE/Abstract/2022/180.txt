This article presents a novel information-based mission planner for a drone tasked to monitor a spatially distributed dynamical phenomenon. For the sake of simplicity;  the area to be monitored is discretized. The insight behind the proposed approach is that;  due to the spatiotemporal dependencies of the observed phenomenon;  one does not need to collect data on the entire area;  which is one of the main limiting factors in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications due to their limited autonomy. In fact;  unmeasured states can be estimated using an estimator;  such as a Kalman filter. In this context;  the planning problem becomes the one of generating a flight plan that maximizes the quality of the state estimation while satisfying the flight constraints (e.g.;  flight time). The first result of this article is the formulation of this problem as a special orienteering problem where the cost function is a measure of the quality of the estimation. This results in a mixed-integer semidefinite formulation;  which can be optimally solved for small instances of the problem. For larger instances;  a heuristic is proposed;  which provides suboptimal results. Simulations numerically demonstrate the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed path-planning strategy. We believe that this approach has the potential to increase dramatically the area that a drone can monitor;  thus increasing the number of applications where monitoring with drones can become economically convenient. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
