Cloud container services as the new norm of cloud resource provisioning are more flexible and widely used in workflows scheduling. However;  it is challenging to minimize the cost for workflows scheduling in cloud container services;  especially when workflows arrive time and tasks execution time are uncertain. In this article;  a stochastic hybrid workflows [i.e.;  off-line batch workflows (DIWs) and online stream workflows (DSWs)] scheduling problem in cloud container services is solved. A stochastic hybrid workflows scheduling system (SHWS);  which consists of a workflow analyzer;  workflow classifier;  runtime estimator;  workflow scheduler;  and resource manager;  is designed to manage and schedule DIWs and DSWs. Based on the SHWS;  a stochastic hybrid workflows scheduling algorithm (SHWSA) is proposed to minimize the cost and improve resource utilization. We conduct the experiments using both synthetic data and real-world data to evaluate the proposed SHWSA approach. The results demonstrate the superiority of SHWSA compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
