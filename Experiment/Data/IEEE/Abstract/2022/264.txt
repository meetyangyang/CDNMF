This paper investigates a distributed competition behavior in multi-robot coordination under variable communication topology and switching one. In terms of multi-robot competition-based coordination;  a winner-take-all (WTA) strategy is leveraged to address this issue with inevitable environmental barriers incorporated. Moreover;  an innovative control theory stimulated gradient neural network (CTSGNN) algorithm is proposed to realize the WTA with prominent robustness and convergence over the traditional ones. Besides;  to adapt to diversified local communication modes among multi-robot systems;  fast variable and low switching topologies are constructed to establish two dynamic consensus estimators;  accompanied by the proposed distributed control schemes. Traditional algorithms are introduced and served as a contrast. Afterward;  the global convergence of the proposed algorithm in dealing with multi-robot competitive coordination;  the universality of the application scenario;  as well as the weaknesses of traditional methods are substantiated theoretically. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CTSGNN algorithm and the resultant distributed control schemes by integrating consensus estimators are further sustained via simulations.
