With the popularization of service-oriented manufacturing;  the current operation & maintenance (O&M) has shifted from traditional in-house maintenance to proactive outsourcing maintenance. It is paramount for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to provide timely and cost-effective maintenance schemes to geographically distributed customer enterprises. Interestingly;  transportation theories could be combined to facilitate multi-location O&M management. In this paper;  a transportation-oriented cross-regional opportunistic maintenance (TCOM) policy is developed for solving O&M optimizations and planning real-time schemes for the multi-center service network. The optimization model of this TCOM policy addresses several inter-related decisions: (1) most suitable maintenance times for each leased machine;  (2) cost-effective arrangements of technician teams to perform maintenance tasks;  and (3) optimal service routes for required teams. We not only integrate maintenance grouping and technician routing;  but also investigate the new issues arising from the collaborative sharing of technician teams belonging to different maintenance centers. Numerical examples show that this TCOM policy can achieve significant cost-saving in cross-regional maintenance grouping and multi-location routing optimization for OEMs. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
