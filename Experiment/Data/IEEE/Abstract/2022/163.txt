Nowadays;  advanced manufacturing models;  such as the stream-of-variation (SoV) model;  have been successfully applied to derive the complex relationships between fixturing;  manufacturing;  and datum errors throughout a multistage machining process. However;  the current development of the SoV model is still based on 3-2-1 fixturing schemes;  and although some improvements have been done;  e.g.;  N-2-1 fixtures;  the effect of general workholding systems;  such as bench vices or three-jaw chucks;  has not yet been included into the model. This article presents the extension of the SoV model to include fixture and datum errors considering both bench vices and three-jaw chucks as fixturing devices in multistage machining processes. The model includes different workholding configurations;  and it is shown how to include the workholding accuracy to estimate part quality. The extended SoV model is validated in a three-stage machining process by both machining experimentation and CAD simulations. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
