This article proposes a new approach for computing a semiexplicit form of the solution to a class of traffic flow problems encoded by a Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equation (PDE);  with time-switched Hamiltonian. Using a characterization of the problem derived from viability theory;  we show that the solution associated with the problem can be formulated as a minimization problem involving the trajectory of an auxiliary dynamical system. A generalized Lax–Hopf formula for the switched Hamiltonian problem is derived;  which enables us to compute the solution associated with affine initial or boundary conditions as a linear program involving the control function of the auxiliary dynamical system. This formulation allows us to compute the solution to the original problem exactly;  unlike dynamic programming methods. In addition;  this method allows one to very efficiently recompute the boundary conditions associated with an initial condition problem;  allowing large-scale variable speed limit traffic control problems to be solved. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
