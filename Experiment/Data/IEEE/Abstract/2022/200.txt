Cooperation among multiple connected vehicles (CVs) brings swarm intelligence to our transportation systems and helps improve their performance. This study proposes a fuel economy optimization approach for a platooning vehicle swarm via distributed economic model predictive control (DEMPC). Within the DEMPC framework;  each CV shares its assumed trajectory in the predictive horizon with its neighboring CVs at each control loop. With its neighborsâ€™ and its own assumed trajectories;  each CV first solves an open-loop control optimization problem for platoon formation;  and then solves an open-loop economic optimization problem for direct fuel economy improvement. In particular;  the optimal cost of the former optimization problem is used in the latter one to build an upperbound constraint for stability guarantee. The asymptotic convergence of assumed terminal states is given in the analysis;  and the recursive feasibility of the two optimization problems are proved with an explicit constraint on the weight matrices in the open-loop control optimization problem. Based on these analyses;  the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is finally proved through Lyapunov analysis. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of closed-loop stability and fuel economy improvement.
