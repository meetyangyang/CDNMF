In order to generalize the applicability of Conditional Value at Risk;  one of the most widely used measurements used in financial risk management;  we develop a solution methodology for the conditional expectation (CE)-based simulation optimization problems. To optimize CE-based objective functions in a highly generalized context;  we propose a gradient-free;  direct search optimization method;  called SNM-CE;  which inherits the search framework of Stochastic Nelder-Mead (SNM) Simplex Method but further incorporates effective mechanisms designed for handling problems with CE-based objective functions. As we assume the underlying problem is complicated enough that no closed-form expression can represent the objective function;  stochastic simulation is applied to estimate CE. We apply Importance Sampling (IS) as a variance reduction technique;  which;  combined with a newly-developed methodology;  called SOCBA-mn;  ensures that simulation resources are used with great efficiency. We show that SNM-CE can converge to the true global optimum with probability one (w.p.1) like SNM. An extensive numerical study and a communication system-based empirical study are both conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness;  efficiency and viability of this research in both theoretical and practical settings.
