We propose a game attack–defense graph (GADG) approach that integrates the attack–defense graph and the game theory to model and analyze cyberattacks and defenses in the local metering system (LMS). Different from previous studies concentrating on static analyses of cybervulnerabilities;  the GADG method considers correlations among these vulnerabilities. Besides;  to avoid the uncertainty brought by unilateral analysis;  we introduce the game theory for the interaction analysis between the attacker and the defender. The mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium that they finally reach can serve as the input for the inference of system states. We also propose two eliminating algorithms to reduce the complexity of solving mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium on large-scale LMS. In the case study;  our GADG model has been conducted on a real LMS;  and the results prove its efficiency. This research aims to assist the power company in optimizing the allocation of limited defensive resources;  especially specific in attacking steps. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
