To avoid unexpected failures of engineering systems;  sensors have been widely used to monitor the degradation process of the systems. A number of studies have been conducted to analyze the collected sensor signals and predict the failure time. However;  the existing studies are usually restricted and cannot be adapted to different practical situations. In this paper;  we propose a systematic method for degradation modeling and prognosis that can be widely applied in different scenarios. In particular;  the proposed method is capable to handle one or multiple sensors;  powerful to capture the nonlinear relations between sensor signals and the degradation process with few assumptions;  generic to consider multiple failure modes;  flexible to deal with unequally spaced sensor measurements or asynchronous signals;  and easily understandable with little preprocessing required. The main idea is to predict the failure time of an in-service unit based on a subset of the nearest historical units;  where features are extracted from each sensor to describe the progression of sensor signals and local linear regression models are constructed to establish the relation between failure time and the extracted features. The prediction variance is then used as the goodness-of-fit measure;  based on which decision-level fusion and feature-level fusion are proposed to combine multiple sensors. A case study with two datasets on the degradation modeling of aircraft engines is conducted which shows satisfactory performance of the proposed method.
