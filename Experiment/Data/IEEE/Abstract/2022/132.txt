Cluster tools play a significant role in the entire process of wafer fabrication. As the width of circuits in semiconductor chips shrinks down to less than 10nm;  strict operational constraints are imposed on the operations of cluster tools in order to ensure the quality of processed wafers. Particularly;  wafer residency time constraints and chamber cleaning requirements are commonly seen in etching;  chemical vapor deposition;  coating processes;  etc. They make the scheduling problem of cluster tools more challenging. This work aims to provide a solution for dual-arm cluster tools with wafer residency time constraints and chamber cleaning requirements. To do so;  it proposes a novel virtual wafer-based scheduling method. By this method;  under a steady state;  a PM processes either a real or virtual wafer at a time. When a PM processes a virtual one;  its chamber can perform a cleaning operation. In this way;  we can meet not only the strict residency time constraints for real wafers;  but also innovatively meet chamber cleaning requirements. Based on such a novel scheduling method;  an efficient binary integer programming model is established to optimize the throughput of cluster tools. Finally;  experiments are performed to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
