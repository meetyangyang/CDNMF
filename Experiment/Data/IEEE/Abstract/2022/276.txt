In relation to automated 3D concrete construction printing;  a structure design of a suitable robot manipulator is presented as well as analytical solutions of related kinematics. The proposed structure has a higher number of degrees of freedom which can significantly increase the dexterity of a robot end-effector carrying a printing head. It should perform a continual motion along complicated large-scale printing trajectories. The related robot kinematics is derived by a novel representation of working layers in the complex plane using exponential functions. It leads to an explicit derivation of kinematic equations. The theoretical results are presented by examples of motion trajectories with typical configurations of the proposed structure.
