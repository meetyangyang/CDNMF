This paper investigates a new multi-objective order assignment and scheduling problem for personal protective equipment (PPE) production and distribution during the outbreak of epidemics like COVID-19. The objective is to simultaneously minimize the total cost and maximize the PPE supply timeliness. For the problem;  we first develop a bi-objective mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Then an \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-constraint combined with logic-based Benders decomposition method is proposed based on some explored properties. We then extend the proposed model to handle dynamics and randomness. In particular;  we design a predictive reactive rescheduling approach to address random order arrivals and manufacturer disruptions. Computational experiments on a real case from China and 100 randomly generated instances are conducted. Results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms an adapted \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-constraint method combined with the proposed MILP and the widely used non-dominated sorting genetic \n<xref ref-type=\algorithm\ rid=\alg2\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>algorithm II</xref>\n (NSGA-II) in obtaining high-quality Pareto solutions. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
