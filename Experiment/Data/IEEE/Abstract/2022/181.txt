Flexure-based scanning stages driven by piezoelectric (PZT) actuator with large stroke;  nanoscale precision;  and high bandwidth are quite appealing for developing an advanced multiphoton polymerization 3-D nanolithography system. The motivation of this article is to develop a nanopositioning system;  which can simultaneously achieve large stroke;  high bandwidth;  and nanoscale precision to ensure its machining size;  efficiency;  and accuracy without traditional step-by-step splicing operations. First;  an \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>XY</i>\n nanopositioning stage with millimeter-scale workspace and nanoscale positioning accuracy is designed. Besides;  the natural frequency modeling of the nanopositioning stage is conducted by resorting to compliance analysis based on the matrix method;  which is validated by a finite-element analysis (FEA). Moreover;  linear active disturbance rejection controller (LADRC) is demonstrated that it can be equivalent to a PID controller filtered using a second-order low-pass filter;  which theoretically verifies the effectiveness of controlling the nanopositioning stage. In order to complete LADRC’s successful implementation for nanopositioning stage;  a novel quantitative one-parameter-tuning method of LADRC is proposed. Finally;  a series of trajectory tracking experiments has been carried out to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed nanopositioning stage. The experimental results verify that the large-stroke compliant nanopositioning system has the capability to achieve millimeter stroke;  which has reached 1.035 mm \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\times \\; \\; 1.035$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n mm;  while the average tracking error is kept within ±100 nm;  and the closed-loop bandwidth is achieved up to 32 Hz. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
