Although surface with multiple holes (SMHs) is widely used in industrial components;  the precise inspection of SMH is a knotty task due to the inefficiency of traditional surface inspection technology. Recently;  a five-axis surface sweep scanning approach is emerging and shows great potential to boost the surface inspection efficiency by sensing surface in a continuous sweep scanning way. However;  an efficient sweep scanning path should cater to the unique kinematic characteristics of the five-axis inspection system. In this article;  we present an approach to automatically generate efficient five-axis sweep scanning paths for inspecting SMH. First;  the skeleton of SMH is extracted along with the surface partitioned into several patches;  based on which a guiding curve-based sweep scanning path can be defined for each surface patch. By modeling the skeleton of SMH as a directed Euler graph and finding a proper sequence to traverse the graph;  a continuous five-axis sweep scanning path is then generated to sweep all patches without any transition among them. The nonsweeping time could be eliminated so that the sweep scanning efficiency is drastically improved in this way. Simulation and physical inspection experiments are conducted on two SMHs;  showing that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches;  such as the popular zigzag method and the method from the leading commercial software of RENISHAW. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
