A secure distributed estimation method against data integrity attacks is presented for general Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. By exploiting the spatial sparsity of the attacks;  a robust optimal estimation objective to protect the entire IoT system is established. Then;  a false data processor is developed to suppress the bad effects of the attacks. The convergence of the presented method is analyzed. It shows that;  under accessible conditions;  the estimation error will converge to be uniformly bounded for all cases;  i.e.;  all communication links and transmitted data are arbitrarily compromised. Furthermore;  by utilizing the property of persistence;  a quantitative trust model is established for IoT systems based on the past behaviors of the nodes. Then;  a trust-based distributed estimation method is proposed to enhance security. Simulation results by considering an IoT system with 50 nodes and 145 edges are also provided to verify our theoretical results. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
