This article presents the design and implementation of an innovative biomimetic underwater vehicle (BUV) and its locomotion controller. Through mimicking a dactylopteridae;  the hybrid propulsion BUV is designed with two symmetrical bio-inspired long-fins and a double-joint fishtail. The mechatronic design of the dactylopteridae-inspired BUV with the pectoral long-fins and a double-joint fishtail is first provided. The two flexible long-fins compose the median and/or paired fin (MPF) propulsion;  while the fishtail acts as the body and/or caudal fin (BCF) propulsion. Through the coordination of BCF and MPF propulsion modes;  the BUV obtains excellent low-speed locomotion stability and also keeps high maneuverability. Moreover;  the locomotion control methods based on central pattern generators (CPGs) model and fuzzy adaptive proportion integral differential (PID) are proposed for this BUV. In the end;  the experimental results of the multimode motion and closed-loop motion control demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the mechanism and the locomotion control system. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
