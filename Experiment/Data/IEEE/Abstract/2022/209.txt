Humans make daily routine decisions based on their internal states in intricate interaction scenarios. This article presents a probabilistically reconstructive learning approach to identify the internal states of multivehicle sequential interactions when merging at highway on-ramps. We treated the merging task’s sequential decision as a dynamic;  stochastic process and then integrated the internal states into a hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) model;  a probabilistic combination of an extended GMR and HMM. We also developed a variant of the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and verified it based on a real-world dataset. Experiment results reveal that three interpretable internal states can semantically describe the interactive merge procedure at highway on-ramps. This finding provides a basis for developing an efficient model-based decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a partially observable environment.
