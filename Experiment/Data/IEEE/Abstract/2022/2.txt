This article presents two methods for solving the electric vehicles (EVs) relocation in EV-sharing system: 1) a centralized method where the decisions are taken by a unique decision-maker by using the complete knowledge of the system and 2) a randomized matheuristic algorithm where decisions are taken by the stations that coordinate for solving the relocation problem. For each methodology;  two approaches are proposed for the EV relocation;  i.e.;  the relocation performed by the EV-sharing operators and the relocation involving registered users also with an incentive scheme based on the crowdsourcing concept. In both the methods;  two integer linear programming (ILP) problems are formulated to minimize the relocation cost in the two considered approaches. Moreover;  in the randomized matheuristic method;  a set of smart stations solve local ILP problems to produce a relocation plan. Finally;  some instances and a case study are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches for the EVs relocation problem.
