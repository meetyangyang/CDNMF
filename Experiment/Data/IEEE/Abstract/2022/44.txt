During the COVID-19 pandemic;  communities faced two conflicting objectives: 1) minimizing infections among vulnerable populations with higher risk for severe illness and 2) enabling reopening to revive American livelihoods. The U.S. pandemic strategy myopically considered one objective at a time;  with lockdowns that addressed the former;  but was detrimental to the latter;  and phased reopening that pursued the latter;  but lost control over the former. How could we prioritize interventions to simultaneously minimize cases of severe illness and fatalities while reopening? A team of researchers anchored by the Center on Stochastic Modeling;  Optimization;  & Statistics (COSMOS);  The University of Texas at Arlington;  has formulated a computationally efficient optimization framework;  referred to as COSMOS COVID-19 Linear Programming (CC19LP);  to study the delicate balance between the expected fatality rate due to cases of severe illness and the level of normalcy in the community. The key to the CC19LP framework is a focus on “key contacts” that separate individuals at higher risk from the rest of the population. CC19LP minimizes expected fatalities by optimizing the use of available interventions;  namely;  COVID-19 testing;  personal protective equipment (PPE);  COVID-19 vaccines;  and social precautions;  such as distancing;  handwashing;  and face coverings. A C3.ai award-winning online CC19LP tool is accessible from the COSMOS COVID-19 project site (\n<uri xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>https://cosmos.uta.edu/projects/covid-19/</uri>\n) and has been tested for all 3142 U.S. county areas. Results are demonstrated for several metropolitan counties with a deeper investigation for Miami-Dade County in Florida. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
