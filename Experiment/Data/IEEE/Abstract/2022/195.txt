Because more and more solid waste is generated;  in particular;  in cities;  the management of solid waste disposal has become a global challenge. A solution is to find an effective way to sort solid waste materials and recycle them into reusable products. In this article;  we propose to use a material recognition method with vision-guided tactile to form a robotic system for waste sorting. The vision guidance module integrates an object detector and an affordance network together. It allows the robot to not only detect the desired containers and packaging from an assortment of the waste but also obtain a configuration to grasp the target and actively collect its tactile data. By classifying the object with the tactile data;  the robot can sort containers and packaging into their respective categories according to the type of material. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robotic waste sorting system in sorting containers and packaging various types of materials.
