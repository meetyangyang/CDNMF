A precise localization system and a map that properly represents the environment are fundamental for several robotic applications. Traditional LiDAR SLAM algorithms are particularly susceptible to underestimating the distance covered by real robots in environments with few geometric features. Common industrial confined spaces;  such as ducts and galleries;  have long and homogeneous structures;  which are difficult to map. In this paper;  we propose a novel approach;  the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>EKF-LOAM</i>\n;  which fuses wheel odometry and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data into the LeGO-LOAM algorithm using an Extended Kalman Filter. For that;  the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>EKF-LOAM</i>\n uses a simple and lightweight adaptive covariance matrix based on the number of detected geometric features. Simulated and real-world experiments with the EspeleoRob√¥;  a service robot designed to inspect confined places;  show that the \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>EKF-LOAM</i>\n method reduces the underestimating problem;  with improvements greater than 50% when compared to the original LeGO-LOAM algorithm. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
