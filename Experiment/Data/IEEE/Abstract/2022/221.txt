The security and economy of multienergy systems (MESs) are directly threatened by the potential cyberattacks. It is of great importance to investigate the effects of cyberattacks;  e.g.;  denial of service (DoS) attacks;  on distributed energy management algorithms. To this end;  this article focuses on exploring how the frequency and the time of duration of DoS attacks influence the behavior of Newtonâ€“Raphson-based distributed energy management (NRBDEM) algorithm for MES and in which condition the optimal operations can still be obtained. First;  a switched NRBDEM algorithm is presented;  which is composed of the normal operation mode and the attack mode. In the attack mode;  the attackers are able to change the communication structure at will and make it unconnected to destroy the convergence of the switched NRBDEM algorithm. Then;  by making use of automatons to generate the hybrid time domain;  the switched NRBDEM algorithm is further modeled and formulated as a hybrid dynamical system;  which provides a mathematical model for the subsequent convergence analysis. Therein;  the generated hybrid time domain satisfies the average dwell-time constraint and time-ratio constraint to limit the persistent attacks. Furthermore;  we analyze the restrained conditions for persistent attacks;  under which the optimality and convergence of the switched NRBDEM algorithm can be guaranteed still. Finally;  simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
