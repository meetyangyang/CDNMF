This paper studies the maximally permissive robustness analysis of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) with unreliable resources in the paradigm of Petri nets (PNs). Two types of robust markings;  i.e.;  strongly robust markings and weakly robust markings;  are defined in this paper. We propose robustness equivalence and non-robustness equivalence to characterize the markings that exhibit the same robustness and non-robustness;  respectively. Reachability graph (or RG hereafter) is directly used to determine the robustness of markings; however;  it is difficult to use in large-scale systems due to formidable computational difficulty. As an alternative;  we present a reduced reachability graph (or R2G hereafter) based necessary and sufficient condition to check the robustness of markings;  in terms of the liveness analysis of markings in R2G. We show that all safe markings of an R2G correspond to strongly robust markings of the corresponding RG;  and deadlock markings as well as their bad markings and livelock markings as well as their bad markings of an R2G correspond to non-robust markings and weakly robust markings of the corresponding RG;  respectively. Hence;  the robustness of markings in an RG can be determined effectively and efficiently through the liveness analysis of markings in the corresponding R2G.
