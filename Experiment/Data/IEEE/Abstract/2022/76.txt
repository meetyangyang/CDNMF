This article presents a reliable and robust rapidly exploring random tree (R2-RRT*) algorithm to tackle challenges in mission planning of off-road autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) under uncertain terrain environment. Two types of mobility reliability metrics;  namely state mobility reliability (SMR) and mission mobility reliability (MMR);  are first defined to quantify the mobility reliability of an AGV and to incorporate mobility reliability into mission planning. SMR measures the probability that a vehicle can pass through a specific location on a map of interest;  whereas MMR quantifies mobility reliability of a mission path with the consideration of dependence of soil properties and slope over space. Based on the defined SMR and MMR metrics;  two reliability-based robust mission planning models are developed to identify optimal paths that have robust travel time and satisfy specific reliability requirements. Moreover;  a reliability-based path smoothing algorithm is developed to address the suboptimality of R2-RRT*. Results of a case study demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
