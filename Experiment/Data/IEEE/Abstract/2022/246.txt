Manufacturers are pursuing energy-efficient production in response to the fluctuating energy price;  growing global competition;  rigorous international laws;  and severe environmental crisis. This article proposes to boost the energy efficiency of production systems by controlling the production. It extends the existing energy-saving control research by presenting integrated modeling;  analyzing;  and controlling approaches. The work starts from the modeling of the production systems and establishes an analytical model to systematically quantify the production loss resulted from energy-saving control and the various disruptions. A dynamic control algorithm is proposed to reduce energy consumption and maintain desirable productivity. Simulation studies are utilized to demonstrate the application of the proposed method and verify its effectiveness.
