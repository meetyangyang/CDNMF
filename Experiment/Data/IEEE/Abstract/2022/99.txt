This paper presents a dynamic pricing mechanism in the industrial park with demand response programs. A Lagrangian relaxation based dynamic pricing model for electricity and thermal coupled industrial park is formulated;  taking into account energy balance;  feeder exchange and other systems operating constraints. Considering two-markets clearing mechanism and two types of demand response programs;  a dynamic prices prediction model is proposed by long short-term memory (LSTM) technique. Based on the prediction model;  we proposed a real-time prices spike detection model for industrial park;  which can detect prices spike hourly by history data and give rolling prices spike warning for next short-term operating horizon. Simulation experiments validate the theoretic results and show the effectiveness of the dynamic prices spike detection model. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
