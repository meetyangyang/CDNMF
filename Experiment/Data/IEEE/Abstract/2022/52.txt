This article addresses a weekly physician scheduling problem in Covid-19. This problem has arisen in fever clinics in two collaborative hospitals located in Shanghai;  China. Because of the coronavirus pandemic;  the hospitals must consider some specific constraints in the scheduling problem. For example;  due to social distance limitation;  the patient queue lengths are much longer in the coronavirus pandemic;  even with the same waiting patients. Thus;  the hospitals must consider the maximum queue length in the physician scheduling problem. Moreover;  the fever clinicâ€™s scheduling rules are different from those in the common clinic;  and some specific regulatory constraints have to be considered in the epidemic. We first build a mathematical model for this problem;  in which a pointwise stationary fluid flow approximation method is used to compute the queue length. Some linearization techniques are designed to make the problem can be solved by commercial solvers;  such as Gurobi. We find that solving this model from practical applications of the hospital within an acceptable computation time is challenging. Consequently;  we develop an efficient two-phase approach to solve the problem. A staffing model and a branch-and-price algorithm are proposed in this approach. The performances of our models and approaches are discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for real-life data from collaborative hospitals is validated. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
