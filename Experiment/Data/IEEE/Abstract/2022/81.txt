Localization in the complex urban environment is an open problem for current methods. The occlusion from dynamic objects;  such as vehicles and pedestrians;  degenerates the precision of the localization result. This article proposes a pole-like feature-based localization framework to solve this problem. Pole-like objects;  such as posts of lamps or traffic sign and tree trunks;  widely exist in the urban environment and are robust to occlusion;  as they are usually higher than the objects on the road. First;  this type of feature is extracted from the point cloud by a robust clustering algorithm. Then;  the features from different frames of data are stitched to generate a feature map. For online localization;  a Monte Carlo localization (MCL) framework is used to fuse the vehicle motion data and the map-matching result. An improved version of iterative closest point (ICP) that is specifically designed for the pole-like feature association is used for map matching based on the state of every particle. With the MCL scheme;  localization is robust to the local minimum or robot kidnapping problem. Experimental results in the real urban environment demonstrate the precision and robustness of the proposed method;  with mean absolute errors less than 0.20 m and 0.5Â°. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art localization methods in the complex urban environment. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
