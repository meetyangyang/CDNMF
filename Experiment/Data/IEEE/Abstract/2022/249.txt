This article studies a distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop scheduling problem under nonidentical time-of-use electricity tariffs (DHHFSP-NTOU). The makespan and the total electricity charge are considered as the optimization objectives from the view of production and management. The DHHFSP-NTOU considers different processing capabilitie and time-of-use electricity tariffs for each factory. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of DHHFSP-NTOU is established. To solve the DHHFSP-NTOU;  this article proposes an ant colony optimization behavior-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (ACO_MOEA/D). A problem-specific ant colony behavior is presented to construct offspring individuals. Eight neighborhoods within the factory and between factories are adopted to improve the quality of the individuals in the archive set. A right-shift movement is used to reduce the electricity charge. A large number of numerical experiments and comprehensive investigations are carried out to test the efficiency and effectiveness of ACO_MOEA/D. The experimental results show that each component (e.g.;  ant colony behavior;  neighborhoods move operators;  right-shift movement) contributes to the performance of ACO_MOEA/D. The comparisons with several related algorithms show the superiority of ACO_MOEA/D for solving the DHHFSP-NTOU.
