Recent 3-D scanning techniques can produce various kinds of digitized 3-D data. Most of these scanned data are in a format of unstructured point clouds. Such low-level representation of 3-D data usually contains only geometric properties (point positions), while lacking higher level structure cues, for example, feature lines. Feature lines can be defined as a visually prominent characteristic of the shape, including edges, ridges, and valley lines in multiple scales, which can support a lot of downstream applications, such as shape reconstruction and analysis. We present a two-phase algorithm for extracting line-type features on point clouds. To extract both large-scale and shallow feature lines, we first define a statistical metric to detect all potential feature points while immune to the noise to some extent. Then, for correctly reconstructing the feature lines from these identified coarse feature points, we introduce an anisotropic contracting scheme to force feature points lying on the underlying real feature lines. To illustrate the reliability of our method, various experiments have been conducted on both synthetic and raw data. Both visual and quantitative comparisons show that our method is robust to noise and can correctly extract multiscale feature lines. In addition, our method is generally applicable to robotic picking.
