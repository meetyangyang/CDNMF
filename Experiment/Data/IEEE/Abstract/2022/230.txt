We present a decentralized connectivity-maintenance control framework for a heterogeneous humanâ€“robot team. The algorithm is able to manage a team composed of an arbitrary number of mobile robots (drones and ground robots in our case) and humans;  for collaboratively achieving exploration and patrolling tasks. Differently from other works on the subject;  here the human user physically becomes part of the team;  moving in the same environment of the robots and receiving information about the team connectivity through wearable haptics or audio feedback. Although human explores the environment;  robots move so as to keep the team connected via a connectivity-maintenance algorithm; at the same time;  each robot can also be assigned with a specific target to visit. We carried out three human subject experiments;  both in virtual and real environments. Results show that the proposed approach is effective in a wide range of scenarios. Moreover;  providing either haptic or audio feedback for conveying information about the team connectivity significantly improves the performance of the considered tasks;  although users significantly preferred receiving haptic stimuli w.r.t. the audio ones.
