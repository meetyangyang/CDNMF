This paper describes an efficacious virtual-region-based shape control scheme for exploring an unknown occluded dynamic environment;  likely to have multiple targets;  by a swarm of robots. The traditional leader-follower strategy has been intertwined with the shape control technique to achieve group-splitting of the robotic swarm in multi-target or multi-path scenarios. If multiple passages are detected by the parent swarm during the navigational process;  several sub-swarms with proportionate agents will be created for progressing through these separate paths. The splitting philosophy is dependent on the fitment of the virtual elliptical regions in each of the paths found ahead;  which will guide their respective sub-swarms to navigate further. This work;  subsequently;  conceives a realistic condition where two or more pathways merge to form a single lane;  leading to a unique target. In such situations;  the sub-swarms (operating in those paths) rejoin and proceed to the goal as a unified unit. Therefore;  in this work;  two different features of a swarm robotics framework;  namely splitting and merging;  have been studied. The scalability control plan ensures strict cohesiveness amongst the agents (inside the mother swarm or any sub-swarm) during the exploration steps. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed technique;  simulation results along with hardware experiment are duly furnished in this article.
