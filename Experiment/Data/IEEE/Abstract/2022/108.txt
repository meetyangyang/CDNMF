Swarm foraging is a common test case application for multi-robot systems. In this paper RepAtt algorithm is used for improving coordination of a robot swarm by selectively broadcasting repulsion and attraction signals. This is a chemotaxis-inspired search behaviour where robots use the temporal gradients of these signals to navigate towards more advantageous areas. Hardware experiments were used to model and validate realistic;  noisy sound communication and vision system. We then show through extensive simulation studies that RepAtt significantly improves swarm foraging time and robot efficiency under realistic communication and vision models. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
