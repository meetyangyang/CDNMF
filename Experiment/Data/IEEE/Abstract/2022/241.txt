With the surging energy cost and environmental impacts;  strategies to achieve energy-efficient production have attracted increasing concerns of the manufacturing enterprises. For the fact that most manufacturing systems operate in a dynamic and nondeterministic environment;  rescheduling strategies may be beneficial as it serves for adaption of initial schedule to dynamic events. Besides that;  the development of modern information technology in manufacturing practice enables the flexibility of production toward alternative process plans. However;  very little research has focused on the rescheduling problem integrated with process planning for energy saving. Hence;  this work undertakes this challenge by proposing rescheduling decision mechanisms in response to two typical dynamic events with alternative process plans for energy-efficient flexible job shops. More specifically;  by modeling the energy consumption of the flexible manufacturing system;  the problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer programming optimization model. Rescheduling mechanisms for both new job arrivals and machine tool breakdowns are then designed;  based on which a rescheduling algorithm is proposed in the form of a heuristic framework. The significance of the proposed algorithm is exemplified by a comparative case study under various scenarios.
