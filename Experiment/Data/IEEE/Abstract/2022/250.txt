In this article;  an iterative-learning-based robotic controller is developed;  which aims at providing a prescribed assistance or resistance force to the human user. In the proposed controller;  the characteristic parameter of the human upper limb movement is first learned by the robot using the measurable interaction force;  a recursive least square (RLS)-based estimator;  and the Adam optimization method. Then;  the desired trajectory of the robot can be obtained;  tracking which the robot can supply the humanâ€™s upper limb with a prescribed interaction force. Using this controller;  the robot automatically adjusts its reference trajectory to embrace the differences between different human users with diverse degrees of upper limb movement characteristics. By designing a performance index in the form of interaction force integral;  potential adverse effects caused by the time-related uncertainty during the learning process can be addressed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in supplying the prescribed interaction force to the human user.
