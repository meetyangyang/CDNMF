Polyculture farming;  where multiple crop species are grown simultaneously;  has potential to reduce pesticide and water usage while improving the utilization of soil nutrients. However;  it is much harder to automate polyculture than monoculture. To facilitate research;  we present AlphaGardenSim;  a fast;  first order;  open-access polyculture farming simulator with single plant growth and irrigation models tuned using real world measurements. AlphaGardenSim can be used for policy learning as it simulates inter-plant dynamics;  including light and water competition between plants in close proximity and approximates growth in a real greenhouse garden at 25; \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$000\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n the speed of natural growth. This paper extends earlier work with a new action space that includes planting;  which dynamically finds new seed locations that increases resources utilization;  and an adaptive sampling technique to reduce the number of actions taken at each timestep without affecting performance. We also evaluate other automation policies using a novel metric that combines plant diversity and canopy coverage.
