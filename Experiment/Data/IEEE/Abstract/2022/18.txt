System scheduling is a decision-making process that plays an important role in improving the performance of robotic cellular manufacturing (RCM) systems. Timed Petri nets (PNs) are a formalism suitable for graphically and concisely modeling such systems and obtaining their reachable state graphs. Within their reachability graphs;  timed PNsâ€™ evolution and intelligent search algorithms can be combined to find an efficient operation sequence from an initial state to a goal one for the underlying systems of the nets. To schedule RCM systems;  this work proposes an A* search with a new heuristic function based on timed PNs. When compared with related approaches;  the proposed one can deal with token remaining time;  weighted arcs;  and multiple resource copies commonly seen in the PN models of RCM systems. The admissibility of the proposed heuristic function is proved. Finally;  experimental results are given to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method and heuristic function.
