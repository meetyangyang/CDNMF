The automated capability of generating spatial prediction for a variable of interest is desirable in various science and engineering domains. Take precision medicine of cancer as an example;  in which the goal is to match patients with treatments based on molecular markers identified in each patient’s tumor. A substantial challenge;  however;  is that the molecular markers can vary significantly at different spatial locations of a tumor. If this spatial distribution could be predicted;  the precision of cancer treatment could be greatly improved by adapting treatment to the spatial molecular heterogeneity. This is a challenging task because no technology is available to measure the molecular markers at each spatial location within a tumor. Biopsy samples provide direct measurement;  but they are scarce/local. Imaging;  such as MRI;  is global;  but it only provides proxy/indirect measurement. Also available are mechanistic models or domain knowledge;  which are often approximate or incomplete. This article proposes a novel machine learning framework to fuse the three sources of data/information to generate a spatial prediction;  namely;  the knowledge-infused global-local (KGL) data fusion model. A novel mathematical formulation is proposed and solved with theoretical study. We present a real-data application of predicting the spatial distribution of tumor cell density (TCD)—an important molecular marker for brain cancer. A total of 82 biopsy samples were acquired from 18 patients with glioblastoma;  together with six MRI contrast images from each patient and biological knowledge encoded by a PDE simulator-based mechanistic model called proliferation-invasion (PI). KGL achieved the highest prediction accuracy and minimum prediction uncertainty compared with a variety of competing methods. The result has important implications for providing individualized;  spatially optimized treatment for each patient. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
