Tensor data with rich structural information become increasingly important in process modeling;  monitoring;  and diagnosis in manufacturing medical and other applications. Here structural information is referred to the information of tensor components such as sparsity;  smoothness;  low-rank;  and piecewise constancy. To reveal useful information from tensor data;  we propose to decompose the tensor into the summation of multiple components based on their different structural information. In this article;  we provide a new definition of structural information in tensor data. We then propose an additive tensor decomposition (ATD) framework to extract useful information from tensor data. This framework specifies a high dimensional optimization problem to obtain the components with distinct structural information. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to solve it;  which is highly parallelable and thus suitable for the proposed optimization problem. Two simulation examples and a real case study in medical image analysis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the ATD framework.
