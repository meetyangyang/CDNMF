Series elastic actuator (SEA) is a promising compliance device due to its lower output mechanical impedance;  and it is widely applied to ensure safe humanâ€“robot interaction. Although some efforts have been made to achieve accurate stiffness tracking;  the time-delay issue in SEA control has still not been well investigated. However;  the time delay can cause an inaccurate response and increase the risk of injury. To overcome this problem;  this article proposes a fast-response admittance control method for SEAs. First;  an admittance control scheme considering the external force estimation is developed for a hydraulic SEA. Then;  a parallel adaptive time-series (ATS) (P-ATS) compensator is proposed and further adopted in the admittance control scheme to compensate for the time delay and tracking error. The P-ATS compensator is a modification of the ATS compensator;  which is enhanced with a unique parallel mechanism. Such a mechanism can save more computational resources on locating better parameters the for P-ATS compensator;  thus improving its performance. Moreover;  the parameter setting is converted to an optimization task;  which is solved by the whale swarm algorithm (WSA) to achieve higher accuracy. The newly located parameters are compared to the current parameters based on a proposed evaluation criterion;  thus guaranteeing the quality of the updated parameters. All the above strategies are employed to improve the SEA admittance control performance. The results obtained from both simulation and real-world experiments validate that;  compared to conventional methods;  the proposed method achieves a better performance in SEA stiffness tracking with lower time delay and tracking error. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
