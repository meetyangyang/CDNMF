Sensory data is only meaningful if correctly associated with originating locations;  e.g.;  in three-dimensional wireless sensor systems inside an aircraft cabin. Received signal strength is a cost-effective option to locate low-cost sensors due to its universal availability;  but suffers from coarse ranging accuracy with multiplicative errors. This paper presents a new received signal strength-based approach to locating a large number of low-cost sensors given their possible three-dimensional installation points. Our approach achieves the accuracy which has not been achieved in the literature. The approach first cooperatively locates the sensors in the continuous three-dimensional spaces;  then associates the continuous location estimates to the installation points;  and finally refines the association with likelihood ascent search. A new convex relaxation-based optimization is designed for cooperative localization in continuous three-dimensional spaces. The Kuhn-Munkres algorithm is generalized for the association. Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bounds are derived to specify the local three-dimensional regions in which refinement is carried out to improve the final accuracy with little complexity overhead. The proposed approach is validated experimentally with signal strength measurements collected in a Fokker 100 passenger plane;  achieves 100% accuracy in all experiments conducted;  and outperforms state-of-the-art metaheuristics significantly with much shorter execution time.
