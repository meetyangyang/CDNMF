In modern industrial production;  rotating machinery plays an important role. The gears in this machinery adjust the speed and transmission of torque. Therefore;  when the gear fails;  it is very important to be able to diagnose the fault quickly and accurately. Gear vibration signals are often used in gear fault diagnosis;  but the fault signal is often overwhelmed by noises. To enable the scientific and efficient detection of faults;  this study proposes a gear fault diagnosis method based on variational modal decomposition (VMD) and wide+narrow visual field neural networks (WNVNNs);  namely VMD-WNVNN. VMD-WNVNN consists of two stages. In the feature extraction stage;  VMD and Pearson correlation coefficients are used to decompose and reconstruct the original data to obtain the features of these data in the frequency domain. In the classification stage;  WNVNN is used to classify the data based on features. The final results of the gear fault diagnosis experiments show that this method not only has higher classification accuracy but also has higher classification stability than other recently proposed methods.
