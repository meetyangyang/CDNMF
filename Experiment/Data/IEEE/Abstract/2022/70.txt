Touch modality identification has attracted increasing attention due to its importance in humanâ€“robot interactions. There are three issues involved in the tactile perception for the touch modality identification;  including the high dimensionality of tactile signals;  complex tensor morphology of tactile sensing units;  and the misalignment among different tactile time-series samples. In this article;  we propose a novel kernel-based approach to deal with these three issues in a unified framework. Specifically;  the techniques;  including sparse principal component analysis and subsampling;  are employed to reduce the feature dimension. Then;  a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based kernel is proposed to preserve the spatial information of the tactile sensing elements. The sample misalignment issue is addressed via the employment of a global alignment kernel. Moreover;  the merits of these two kernels are fused through an ideal regularized composite kernel;  which simultaneously takes the label information of the training set into consideration. The effectiveness of the proposed kernel-based approach is verified on a public touch modality data set with a comprehensive comparison with the competing methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
