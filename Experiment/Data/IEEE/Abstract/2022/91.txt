The enormous energy consumed by clouds becomes a significant challenge for cloud providers and smart grid operators. Due to performance concerns;  applications typically run in different clouds located in multiple sites. In different clouds;  many factors;  including electricity prices;  available servers;  and task service rates;  exhibit spatial variations. Therefore;  it is important to manage and schedule tasks among multiple clouds in a high-quality-of-service and low-energy-cost manner. This work proposes a task scheduling method to jointly minimize energy cost and average task loss possibility (ATLP) of clouds. A problem is formulated and tackled with an adaptive biobjective differential evolution based on simulated annealing to determine a real-time and near-optimal set of solutions. A final knee solution is further chosen to specify suitable servers in clouds and task allocation among web portals. Simulation results based on realistic data prove that less average loss possibility of tasks;  and smaller energy cost is obtained with it than its widely used peers. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
