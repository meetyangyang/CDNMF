Ambulance offload delays have become a challenging concern for emergency healthcare service providers. These delays often occur when the number of patients in the emergency department (ED) exceed the designed capacity such that ED cannot accept an incoming patient immediately;  thereby forcing the ambulance and crew to wait with the patient until a bed becomes available. In this paper;  we analyze and optimize the emergency medical services network;  including ambulance stations and EDs. The objective is to reduce ambulance offload delays and lessen the congestion of EDs. To this end;  we first build a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize this network analytically. Next;  from the perspectives of both ambulance stations and EDs;  we develop resource configuration and optimization models for this network. We investigate the reasons for ED overcapacity and ambulance offload delays. Finally;  we design an effective approach to reconfigure the resources in the emergency medical services network;  leading to a new and better equilibrium.
