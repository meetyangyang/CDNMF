Manufacturing systems may be subject to external attacks and failures;  so it is important to deal with the recovery of the system after these situations. This article deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system;  modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the supervisory control theory (SCT);  when the control structure;  called supervisor;  desynchronizes from the physical plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word;  the synchronizing word;  that regardless the state of each one of them;  brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article;  we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors;  proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems;  composed of machines and buffers;  as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
