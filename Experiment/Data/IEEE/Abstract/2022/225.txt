This article reports on the design;  modeling;  control;  and testing of a novel compliant nanopositioning stage driven by a self-developed normal-stressed electromagnetic actuator. To facilitate the parameter selection for the stage to achieve the desired stroke and natural frequency;  an analytical model of both the electromagnetic circuit and flexure mechanism is established;  which is then systematically verified through finite element analysis. By combining a proportional—integral—differential (PID)-based main controller with a system dynamics inversion-based feedforward compensator;  a closed-loop control system for the stage is constructed with the main controller being tuned through Bode’s ideal transfer function-based loop-shaping method. The experimental result shows that a stroke of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>${\\pm } 95 ~\\mu \\text{m}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and a first natural frequency of 743 Hz are achieved for the designed stage. Finally;  taking advantage of the constructed control system;  the nanopositioning capability is demonstrated by finely tracking the harmonic and nanostair commands.
