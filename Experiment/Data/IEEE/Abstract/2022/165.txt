For pose stabilization task of nonholonomic mobile robots;  this article proposes a novel integrated interactive framework;  bridging the gap between visual servoing and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The framework consists of two cooperative components;  control module for servoing task and SLAM module for feedback signals estimation. In most visual servoing methods;  feedback signals for the servoing controller are estimated by means of multiple-view geometry assuming the target scene being always within the camera field of view (FOV). To handle the challenge that the target scene gets out of view during servoing process;  the desired image is associated with the initial map by a two-step strategy;  and an incremental map is constructed to guarantee available feedback signals estimation. In addition;  on the basis of the kinematic model of the mobile robot and velocities designed by the servo controller;  the predicted pose is exploited to discard moving objects in the camera FOV;  thus making the proposed framework effective in dynamic scenes. Experimental results operated in different scenes without prior information demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to handle the FOV problem and dynamic scenes. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
