Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based car-following strategy can break through the constraints of the differential equation model due to the ability of exploration on complex environments. However;  the car-following performance of DDPG is usually degraded by unreasonable reward function design;  insufficient training;  and low sampling efficiency. In order to solve this kind of problem;  a hybrid car-following strategy based on DDPG and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) is proposed. First;  the car-following process is modeled as the Markov decision process to calculate CACC and DDPG simultaneously at each frame. Given a current state;  two actions are obtained from CACC and DDPG;  respectively. Then;  an optimal action;  corresponding to the one offering a larger reward;  is chosen as the output of the hybrid strategy. Meanwhile;  a rule is designed to ensure that the change rate of acceleration is smaller than the desired value. Therefore;  the proposed strategy not only guarantees the basic performance of car-following through CACC but also makes full use of the advantages of exploration on complex environments via DDPG. Finally;  simulation results show that the car-following performance of the proposed strategy is improved compared with that of DDPG and CACC.
