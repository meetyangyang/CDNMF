Checking the diagnosability of a timed discrete-event system usually consists in determining whether a single fault event can always be identified with certainty after a finite amount of time. The aim of this article is to extend this type of analysis to more complex behaviors;  called event patterns;  and to propose an effective method to check diagnosability with the use of model-checking techniques. To do so;  we propose to convert the pattern diagnosability problem into checking a linear-time property over a specific time Petri net. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
