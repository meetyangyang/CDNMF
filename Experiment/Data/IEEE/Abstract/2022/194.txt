RobotCat uses a goal-oriented;  declarative approach for robot programming that leverages mathematical representations found in category theory as a way to formally model modularity and behavioral knowledge. We define hierarchical interfaces that require only local modifications when new software or work cell models are introduced;  thus making robot programming more interoperable. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
