Many core technologies of Industry 4.0 have gained substantial advancement in recent years. Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology and tool for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent cyber-physical integration and digital transformation by leveraging these technologies. Although there have been many DT-related works;  there is no standard definition;  unified framework;  and implementation approach of DT until now. Widely developing DTs for the manufacturing industry is still challenging. Thus;  this paper proposes a novel implementation framework of digital twins for intelligent manufacturing;  denoted as IF-DTiM;  which possesses several distinct merits to distinguish itself from previous works. First;  IF-DTiM fully utilizes new-generation container technology so that DT-related applications and services can be packaged in a self-contained way;  rapidly deployed;  and robustly operated with the capabilities of failover;  autoscaling;  and load balancing. Second;  it leverages existing intelligent cloud manufacturing services to realize the intelligence for DT externally in a scalable and plug-and-play manner instead of using traditional approaches to embed intelligence in DT. Third;  IF-DTiM contains Product DT for products;  Equipment DT (i.e.;  EQ DT) for equipment;  and Process DT for production lines;  which can generically fulfill the demands and scenarios to achieve intelligent manufacturing for various manufacturing industries. Testing results show that IF-DTiM can achieve remarkable performance in rapid deployment and real-time data exchanges of DT-related applications. Finally;  we develop an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM to demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in facilitating the manufacturing industry to build their DT systems. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
