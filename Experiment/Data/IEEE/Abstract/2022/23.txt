Prognostics and health management aims to use on-line sensor data to monitor and predict current and future health conditions of degraded systems and components. Nowadays;  constructing composite health indices for characterizing current health conditions of a system from multiple degradation-based sensor data has attracted much attention. These kinds of “data-level” models show strong ability to provide a better degradation characterization of a degraded system than a model solely depending on data from an individual sensor. Although numerous efforts have been made to propose “data-level” fusion methodologies for process data;  such as temperature;  pressure;  speeds;  etc.;  little research has targeted “data-level” fusion models for nonprocess data;  such as vibration and acoustic signals. In this article;  a methodology for constructing a composite health index from fusion of spectrum amplitudes is proposed. Here;  each spectrum amplitude can be regarded as “an individual sensor.” The goal of this article is that a composite health index generated from fusion of spectrum amplitudes can simultaneously detect incipient faults and provide a monotonically increasing trend for degradation assessment. Our proposed methodology was verified by two illustrative examples including gearbox run-to-failure vibration data and bearing run-to-failure vibration data. Results showed that our proposed methodology is better than popular sparse measures for gear and bearing health monitoring and degradation assessment.
