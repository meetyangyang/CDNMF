The use of ensemble approaches in the single-objective evolutionary algorithms is ubiquitous;  but ensembles of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have achieved relatively little attention. On the other hand;  manually selecting a suitable MOEA to solve an actual multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) is time-consuming and challenging. Therefore;  developing a multiobjective hyperheuristic to allocate computational resources for multiple MOEAs in an intelligent approach is beneficial. In this work;  an autoselection strategy of MOEAs based on the performance indicator (MOEAS-PI) is introduced to alleviate the abovementioned problem. In the MOEAS-PI;  the performance of each constituent MOEA in the pool is assessed according to a real-time and comprehensive performance indicator;  which contains both the current and future performances. The MOEAS-PI is able to easily choose the best performing MOEA during the evolutionary process. Also;  it can enhance the robustness of MOEAs and reduce the application risk. The effectiveness of the MOEAS-PI is carefully evaluated on 23 MOPs. Simulation results demonstrate that the MOEAS-PI is an effective and efficient method to integrate the advantages of each individual algorithm. Finally;  the MOEAS-PI is utilized to solve a translation control problem of an immersed tunnel element under current flow. Experimental results reveal that the MOEAS-PI is a reliable and effective optimization approach to solve actual MOPs. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
