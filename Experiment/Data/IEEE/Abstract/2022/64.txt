This study addresses the problem of the estimation of state when heterogeneous multiagent systems are affected by homologous unknown inputs (UIs). Homologous UIs refer to identical UIs affecting different agents. An improved semidistributed filter based on previous research is proposed. The improved filter uses neighborsâ€™ information for UI estimation but not state estimation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the proposed filter to achieve minimum-variance unbiased estimation is presented and proven. Moreover;  the asymptotic stability of the filter is analyzed. A sufficient condition of the asymptotic stability is presented and proven. The theoretical and numerical analyses indicate that the proposed filter has less communication pressure;  fewer calculation requirements;  and better estimation performance compared with the existing solutions. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
