Service coordination among hospitals is a crucial strategy to improving care outcomes and operational efficiency of healthcare delivery systems. This article proposes a referral cooperation system where patients can be referred from one upper-level hospital (ULH) to one lower-level hospital (LLH) for services provided in both types of hospitals with similar service qualities. For multitype patients with different disease conditions;  a method for determining the types and quantities of patients that should be referred is explored based on ensuring the interests of the ULH and LLH simultaneously. This article proposes a threshold control method to address these issues along with the Pareto-based negotiation process to implement referral. The control decisions of both ULH and LLH can be achieved by the developed Pareto optimization based on particle swarm optimization-optimal computing budget allocation (POPSO-OCBA) simulation optimization method. To implement the threshold control easily;  we further propose a simplified referral control method and conclude that when the flow variability is small;  the method can approach similar effects as the previously proposed control while significantly reducing the administrative costs. The methodologies are studied using numerical investigation and a real case exploration in Shanghai. The results show that the methodologies are effective in helping to make the decisions in practice. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
