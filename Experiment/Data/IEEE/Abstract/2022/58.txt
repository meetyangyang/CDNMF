The automatic control of blast furnace (BF) ironmaking process has always been an important yet arduous task in metallurgic engineering and automation. In this article;  a novel Kalman filter-based robust model-free adaptive predictive control (MFAPC) method is proposed for the direct data-driven control of molten iron quality in BF ironmaking. First;  a compact-form dynamic linearization-based extended MFAPC method for multivariable molten iron quality control is proposed by generalizing the existing single-variable MFAPC method to multivariable systems. Based on it;  a Kalman filter-based robust MFAPC is further proposed considering the problems of data loss and measurement noise in quality detection. Specifically;  the robust mechanism in the robust MFAPC combines a novel dynamic linearization method with a concept termed Pseudo-Jacobian matrix to predict the missing data during data loss. After that;  a Kalman filter is constructed based on a prediction model to filter the measurement noise. The stability of the proposed control method is analyzed;  and various data experiments using actual industrial data are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
