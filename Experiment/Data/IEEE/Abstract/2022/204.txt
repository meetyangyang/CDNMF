To solve the autonomous navigation problem in complex environments;  an efficient motion planning approach is newly presented in this paper. Considering the challenges from large-scale;  partially unknown complex environments;  a three-layer motion planning framework is elaborately designed;  including global path planning;  local path optimization;  and time-optimal velocity planning. Compared with existing approaches;  the novelty of this work is twofold: 1) a novel heuristic-guided pruning strategy of motion primitives is proposed and fully integrated into the state lattice-based global path planner to further improve the computational efficiency of graph search;  and 2) a new soft-constrained local path optimization approach is proposed;  wherein the sparse-banded system structure of the underlying optimization problem is fully exploited to efficiently solve the problem. We validate the safety;  smoothness;  flexibility;  and efficiency of our approach in various complex simulation scenarios and challenging real-world tasks. It is shown that the computational efficiency is improved by 66.21% in the global planning stage and the motion efficiency of the robot is improved by 22.87% compared with the recent quintic BÃ©zier curve-based state space sampling approach. We name the proposed motion planning framework E \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$\\mathbf {^{3}} $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\nMoP;  where the number 3 not only means our approach is a three-layer framework but also means the proposed approach is efficient in three stages.
