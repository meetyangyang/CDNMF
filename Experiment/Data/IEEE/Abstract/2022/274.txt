Due to high biological adaptability and flexibility;  pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) systems are widely employed in exoskeleton robots to accomplish rehabilitation training with repetitive motions. However;  some intrinsic characteristics of PAMs and inevitable practical factors;  e.g.;  high nonlinearity;  hysteresis;  uncertain dynamics;  and limited working space;  may badly degrade tracking performance and safety. Hence;  this paper designs a new learning-based motion controller for PAMs;  to simultaneously compensate for model uncertainties;  eliminate tracking errors;  and satisfy preset motion constraints. Particularly;  when PAMs suffer from periodically non-parametric uncertainties;  the elaborately designed continuous update algorithm can repetitively learn them online to enhance tracking accuracy;  without employing upper/lower bounds of unknown parts for controller design and gain selections. Meanwhile;  some non-periodic uncertainties are handled by a robust term;  whose value is only related to the initial states of PAMs;  instead of exact upper bounds of unknown dynamics. From safety concerns;  we introduce error-related saturation terms to limit initial amplitudes of control inputs within saturation constraints and avoid overlarge errors inducing overlarge acceleration. Meanwhile;  the constraint-related auxiliary term is utilized to keep tracking errors within allowable ranges. To the best of our knowledge;  this paper presents the first learning-based error-constrained controller for uncertain PAM-actuated exoskeleton robots;  to realize high-precision tracking control and improve safety without additional gain conditions. Moreover;  the asymptotic convergence of tracking errors is strictly proven by Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Finally;  based on a self-built exoskeleton robot;  the effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by hardware experiments.
