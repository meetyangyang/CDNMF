Both routine radiation surveys and incident response—as currently performed by human workers—are time-consuming and involve significant;  potentially unanticipated radiation dose (especially for accident response where levels prohibit human presence entirely). Previous efforts addressed routine surveys using robotic systems;  but they must also localize and characterize discrete sources when anomalies occur. To be effective;  characterization must account for real-world complications;  including multiple sources;  environmental attenuation;  spatial localization;  and isotopic identification. Recursive Bayesian estimation (RBE) using grid-based estimators and particle filters has been previously investigated;  but we eliminate previous open-space assumptions by including attenuation models and sensor position height in the sequential sampling strategy. The method also incorporates autonomous isotopic identification via gamma spectroscopy;  which supports the attenuation modeling and improves the computational efficiency in multisource cases. In addition;  survey points are autonomously optimized using the Fisher information. A radioactive decay model is implemented to generalize the method by addressing short-lived nuclides. The developed hardware is evaluated in multiple scenarios where no operator intervention is required;  effectively eliminating operator dose uptake from localization/characterization in real-world scenarios. Two different mobile robots are used;  demonstrating the portability of the data collection and analysis software. Also;  the generalized complexity is documented to support planning in future scenarios. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
