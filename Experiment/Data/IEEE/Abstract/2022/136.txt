Foodservice workers perform several burdensome;  tedious;  and unsafe tasks that risk their health and well-being. This could be mitigated or even more avoided by using autonomously-actuated machines. Therefore;  this article aims to build the foundation to support the development of a new field of robotics research dedicated to foodservice and with a human/worker-centered framework. As so;  we introduce a two-level taxonomy of basic actions that compose the physical tasks of foodservice workers; it can guide future studies to design bio-inspired control models for foodservice robots. Actions are clustered in 16 categories according to their purpose and to the handled food. Furthermore;  authors make a critical review of single-action equipment (SAE) and advanced equipment (AE) currently available for foodservice;  which allowed us to identify opportunities for research. As a result;  authors found some categories of actions rarely automated;  aimed at i) separating solid-solid food parts;  ii) moving food between workstations or independent appliances in the kitchen;  iii) introducing food into another solid food or recipient;  and iv) other specific actions;  e.g. trussing food. In addition;  authors discuss the applicability of collaborative robotics and human-robot collaboration to different contexts in foodservice;  and show how artificial intelligence is improving the capabilities of SAE and AE and what else it could improve in this context. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
