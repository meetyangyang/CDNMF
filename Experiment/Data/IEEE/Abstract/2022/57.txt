In a machining process;  proper selection of process plans and cutting parameters can effectively reduce energy consumption and shorten production time. Traditionally;  studies on process planning and cutting parameter optimization for energy saving are mostly concentrated on electrical energy consumption. Since the preparation process of cutting tools and cutting fluid consumes a considerable amount of energy;  conservation of this part of energy consumption;  namely;  the embodied energy consumption;  will achieve a more energy-efficient machining process. In this article;  an integrated model for process planning and cutting parameter optimization is proposed to shorten production time and reduce the energy footprint (namely;  electrical energy consumption and embodied energy consumption of cutting tools and cutting fluid) of a machining process. Considering that the optimization of process plan and cutting parameters in an integrated manner is a hybrid programming process;  simulated annealing and quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (SA-QPSO) hybrid algorithm is employed to solve the proposed model. Results of the case study show that: 1) embodied energy consumption of cutting tools and cutting fluid accounts for a nonnegligible proportion of energy footprint of the machining process and 2) there is a tradeoff between energy footprint and production time;  and the balance of them is achieved through the proposed optimization approach. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
