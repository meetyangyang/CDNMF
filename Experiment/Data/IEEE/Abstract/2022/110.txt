In manufacturing industries, it is of fundamental importance to detect anomalies in production in order to meet the required quality goals and to limit the number of defective products that are accidentally delivered to the customers. Nevertheless, monitoring systems currently employed in production are typically very simple and rely on a set of univariate control charts that fail to capture the multivariate and complex nature of real-world industrial systems. In such context, Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches for Anomaly Detection (AD) have proven to be extremely effective in increasing anomalies detectability and, in general, in enhancing monitoring procedures. However, industrial data are typically very complex and not suitable to be fed directly to classical ML-based AD tools making feature extraction procedures a necessary step that unfortunately may lead to information loss and low scalability. Deep Learning, has proven very effective at learning useful representations of complex data in an automatic way. In this paper, we propose an AD pipeline that makes use of convolutional autoencoders to extract useful features from two-dimensional, non-image, data. We test our approach on real world Optical Emission Spectroscopy data that are typical of semiconductor manufacturing and we achieve improved performance over classical monitoring methods.
