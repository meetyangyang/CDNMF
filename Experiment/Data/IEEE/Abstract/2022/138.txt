Accurate and real-time prediction of network traffic can not only help system operators allocate resources rationally according to their actual business needs but also help them assess the performance of a network and analyze its health status. In recent years;  neural networks have been proved suitable to predict time series data;  represented by the model of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and a temporal convolutional network (TCN). This article proposes a novel hybrid prediction method named SG and TCN-based LSTM (ST-LSTM) for such network traffic prediction;  which synergistically combines the power of the Savitzkyâ€“Golay (SG) filter;  the TCN;  as well as the LSTM. ST-LSTM employs a three-phase end-to-end methodology serving time series prediction. It first eliminates noise in raw data using the SG filter;  then extracts short-term features from sequences applying the TCN;  and then captures the long-term dependence in the data exploiting the LSTM. Experimental results over real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ST-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
