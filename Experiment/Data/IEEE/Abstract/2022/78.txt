The capability to obtain detailed motility information of model organisms is fundamental to reveal their functional and social behavior characteristics. Zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model organism. Despite recent success in the automatic quantification of adult zebrafish movement;  it remains a laborious task for group zebrafish larval tracking due to their similar appearance;  frequent occlusions;  and highly discontinuous kinematics. This article presents DanioSense (DS);  an automatic tracker for group larval zebrafish;  to overcome these tracking challenges. The integration of a light convolutional neural network and a centerline extraction algorithm enables the tracker to localize individuals even in occlusion cases where objects’ identities are prone to switch. With reliable detections;  an adaptive Kalman filter is designed to optimally estimate locomotive parameters;  which is also used for object reidentification accomplished by a two-stage data association protocol. Experimental results demonstrated a tracking accuracy of over 97%;  median errors of \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\> <tex-math notation=\LaTeX\>$102~{\\mathrm{\\mu m}}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n;  and 8.8° for the position and orientation measurement;  and a processing speed of over 30 frames/s with a normal computer configuration. DS provides detailed quantitative data for a large-scale larvae group in nearly real time;  highly boosting the efficiency of characterizing individual phenotypes and analyzing social interactions. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
