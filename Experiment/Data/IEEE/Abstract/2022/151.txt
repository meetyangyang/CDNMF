In this article;  an innovative manufacturing system based on a dual-arm robot;  each arm with five degree-of-freedom (DOF);  is proposed. Although the proposed system can work in the automation mode or machining mode;  only the function of machining is studied here. In this case;  the system is equivalent to a five-axis machine tool. The method of equivalent errors is employed to design a robust contouring controller. It is shown that reducing the equivalent contour error in the joint space is equivalent to reducing both position contour error and tool orientation error in the task space. As a comparison;  a conventional distributed controller is also designed. Several cases of experiments have been conducted;  including a circular path with four different feedrates and an elliptic path. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve much better results in all cases;  and demonstrate the feasibility of adopting the dual-arm robotic system for machining task. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
