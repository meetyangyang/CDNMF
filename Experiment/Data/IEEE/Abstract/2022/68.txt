The use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology for the traceability of products throughout the production chain;  warehouse management;  and the retail network is spreading in the last years;  especially in those industries in line with the concept of Industry 4.0. The last decade has seen the development of increasingly precise and high-performance methods for the localization of goods. This work proposes a reliable 2-D localization methodology that is faster and provides a competitive accuracy;  concerning the state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed method leverages a phase-distance model and exploits the synthetic aperture approach and unwrapping techniques for facing phase ambiguity and multipath phenomena. Trilateration applied on consecutive phase readings allows finding hyperbolae as the localization solution space. Analytic calculus is used to compute intersections among the conics that estimate the tag position. An algorithm computes intersections quality to select the best estimation. Experimental tests are conducted to assess the quality of the proposed strategy. A mobile robot equipped with a reader antenna localizes in 2-D the tags placed in an indoor scenario and reconstructs the map of the environment through a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
