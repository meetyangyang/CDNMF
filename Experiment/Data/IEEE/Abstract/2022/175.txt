Due to the huge volume of point cloud data;  storing and transmitting it is currently difficult and expensive in autonomous driving. Learning from the high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) framework;  we propose a novel compression scheme for large-scale point cloud sequences;  in which several techniques have been developed to remove the spatial and temporal redundancy. The proposed strategy consists mainly of three parts: intracoding;  intercoding;  and residual data coding. For intracoding;  inspired by the depth modeling modes (DMMs);  in 3-D HEVC (3-D-HEVC);  a cluster-based prediction method is proposed to remove the spatial redundancy. For intercoding;  a point cloud registration algorithm is utilized to transform two adjacent point clouds into the same coordinate system. By calculating the residual map of their corresponding depth image;  the temporal redundancy can be removed. Finally;  the residual data are compressed either by lossless or lossy methods. Our approach can deal with multiple types of point cloud data;  from simple to more complex. The lossless method can compress the point cloud data to 3.63% of its original size by intracoding and 2.99% by intercoding without distance distortion. Experiments on the KITTI dataset also demonstrate that our method yields better performance compared with recent well-known methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>
