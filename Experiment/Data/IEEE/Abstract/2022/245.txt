This article proposes an equidistant tool path planning strategy on curved freeform surfaces with the focus on robotic machining tasks. The strategy is based on the arc-length parameterization of the surface and can be considered as a variant of the iso-parametric path planning. This method allows us to directly consider a given Cartesian boundary in the parameter domain. Using an inverse interpolation scheme of the parameterization with cubic splines;  the path planned in arc-length coordinates is mapped back in Cartesian coordinates. The equidistance property is also satisfied for larger path intervals and does not depend on the local curvature of the surface. The proposed trajectory planner ensures a constant velocity along the planned path on the freeform surface while limiting the maximum centripetal acceleration. However;  general velocity profiles can be included depending on the actual machining application. Exploiting the differential geometric properties of the path and surface allows us to directly determine the orientation and angular velocity of the end-effector along the planned trajectory. The proposed methods are demonstrated with a robotic manipulator on a real curved freeform surface.
