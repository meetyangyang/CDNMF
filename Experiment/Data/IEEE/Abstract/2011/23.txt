For the last years;  automation is widely used to relieve humans from repetitive tasks;  primarily and firstly within manufacturing. However;  for products with less ideal (or hard to model) properties;  and when forces depends on human interaction;  auto mated testing has not been explored until now. This work presents the analysis of the (human-dependent) motions/forces based on a fully implemented test case for car-seat testing. For emulation of the corresponding mechanical wear;  an experimental test bench was developed. A sensor mat with a pressure gauge net was used in the test bench to determine the relevant loads;  and the corresponding movements performed by the humans when sitting in a car seat were acquired by means of a photogrammetry system. Finally;  to automate the reproduction of such movements by means of a dummy held by a robot;  several controllers have been developed to regulate the force applied by the dummy on the seat. Simplicity and force-control performance for the human replication was also investigated in this work;  showing the benefit of freely programmable (open) force control. The developed system has many practical applications;  as allowing the analysis of the wearing caused by these movements on the seat upholstery. Thus;  force controlled testing of fabrics using robots is a viable option.
