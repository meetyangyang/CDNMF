In this paper;  we present an analytic approach to evaluate the reactivity of client-server networked automation systems (NASs). Both deterministic and probabilistic analyses are provided while modeling the NAS using Timed Event Graphs (TEG). Since many results with regard to the deterministic approach have already been published;  we recall only its main steps that prove useful;  while exposing the probabilistic method. Thereby;  we provide the density of probability distribution of the response time (or reactivity) using the probability densities of the local delays;  experienced at the different stages of the NAS. Furthermore;  a case study is presented to compare the results of the study to measures taken from a real platform.
