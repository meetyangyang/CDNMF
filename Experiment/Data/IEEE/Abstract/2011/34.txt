Siphon-based deadlock control of Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) runs faster by avoiding reachability analysis;  but reaches fewer states than an optimal. First-met bad marking (FBM) method requires more monitors;  but reaches more states by refining some monitors with smaller (hence less disturbed) controller regions. However;  the same refinement leads to more monitors for other siphons;  which can be combined without losing states. This paper develops the formal theory to uncover the secret behind the above discrepancy. It improves the siphon-based approach to reach more states while using fewer monitors.
