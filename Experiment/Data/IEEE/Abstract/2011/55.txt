A binary integer programming based real-time dispatching heuristic (\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</i>\n-RTD) approach to minimize the makespan of the two-machine batching flow-shop problem with time window constraints is presented for the first time. By scheduling only necessary batches at each iteration;  \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</i>\n -RTD works with considerably fewer binary variables so that it runs in real-time. The experimental study demonstrates the proposed \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</i>\n-RTD can generate the efficient solution in real-time;  which implies we can implement the proposed approach into real industry where a quick and efficient schedule is required.
