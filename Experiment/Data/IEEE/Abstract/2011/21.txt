The problem addressed in this paper is the challenge of automated construction of knowledge discovery workflows;  given the types of inputs and the required outputs of the knowledge discovery process. Our methodology consists of two main ingredients. The first one is defining a formal conceptualization of knowledge types and data mining algorithms by means of knowledge discovery ontology. The second one is workflow composition formalized as a planning task using the ontology of domain and task descriptions. Two versions of a forward chaining planning algorithm were developed. The baseline version demonstrates suitability of the knowledge discovery ontology for planning and uses Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) descriptions of algorithms; to this end;  a procedure for converting data mining algorithm descriptions into PDDL was developed. The second directly queries the ontology using a reasoner. The proposed approach was tested in two use cases;  one from scientific discovery in genomics and another from advanced engineering. The results show the feasibility of automated workflow construction achieved by tight integration of planning and ontological reasoning.
