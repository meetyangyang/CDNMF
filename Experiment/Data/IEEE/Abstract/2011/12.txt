Our study concerns an important current problem;  that of diffusion of information in social networks. This problem has received significant attention from the Internet research community in the recent times;  driven by many potential applications such as viral marketing and sales promotions. In this paper;  we focus on the target set selection problem;  which involves discovering a small subset of influential players in a given social network;  to perform a certain task of information diffusion. The target set selection problem manifests in two forms: 1) top-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n nodes problem and 2) 位 -coverage problem. In the top-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n nodes problem;  we are required to find a set of \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n key nodes that would maximize the number of nodes being influenced in the network. The 位-coverage problem is concerned with finding a set of key nodes having minimal size that can influence a given percentage 位 of the nodes in the entire network. We propose a new way of solving these problems using the concept of Shapley value which is a well known solution concept in cooperative game theory. Our approach leads to algorithms which we call the ShaPley value-based Influential Nodes (SPINs) algorithms for solving the top-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n nodes problem and the 位 -coverage problem. We compare the performance of the proposed SPIN algorithms with well known algorithms in the literature. Through extensive experimentation on four synthetically generated random graphs and six real-world data sets (Celegans;  Jazz;  NIPS coauthorship data set;  Netscience data set;  High-Energy Physics data set;  and Political Books data set);  we show that the proposed SPIN approach is more powerful and computationally efficient.
