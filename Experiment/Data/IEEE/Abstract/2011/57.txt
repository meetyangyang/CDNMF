A pair of mobile robots acting on opposite sides of a thin plate is developed for a class of tasks where robots have to work together;  carrying a pair of end-effectors and traversing across a plate surface. Using powerful magnets;  the paired robots attract each other;  support themselves against gravity;  and generate traction force to move across the panel. First;  the design concept of paired mobile robots is presented;  followed by dynamic modeling and magnetic analysis. Conditions for preventing the robot from falling as well as from slipping on the plate surface are examined. Time-optimal control of the paired robots subject to the no-fall;  no-slip conditions is formulated and solved numerically. Precision positioning control using a laser beacon is designed and tested. A prototype of the paired robots using Halbach array permanent magnets and Lorentz force actuators is developed;  and the control methods are implemented and tested on the prototype.
