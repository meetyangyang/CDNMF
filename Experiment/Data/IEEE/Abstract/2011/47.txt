Many tasks related to the micro/nanoworld require;  not only high performances like submicrometric accuracy;  but also a high dexterity. Such performances are only obtained using micromanipulators and microrobots with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). Unfortunately;  these multi-DOF systems usually present a strong coupling between the different axis making them very hard to control. The aim of this work is the modeling and control of a 2-DOF piezoelectric cantilever dedicated to microassembly/micromanipulation tasks. In addition to the coupling between the two axis;  the piezocantilever is very oscillating and strongly nonlinear (hysteresis and creep). In the proposed approach;  the nonlinearity and vibration are first compensated thanks to the feedforward technique. Afterwards;  we derive a decoupled model in order to synthesize a linear robust H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>âˆž</sub>\n controller. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed approach and their convenience to the micromanipulation/microassembly requirements.
