Batching plays an important role in semiconductor fabs;  and it can lead to inefficiency if not treated with care. The performance of parallel batch processes is often approximated by the G/G/1-based approximate models. By carefully examining the existing models;  the dependence between queueing time and wait-to-batch time has been identified. A new improved model for parallel batch systems is proposed to exploit this dependence. The computation of the new model is still simple and fast;  but it gives better approximation by reducing the systematic error in earlier models which ignored the dependence between queueing time and wait-to-batch time.
