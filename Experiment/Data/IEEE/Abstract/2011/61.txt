In flexible manufacturing environments;  the performance of a production system is often affected by the sequence of operations. While performance evaluation;  improvement and lean design of production systems have been studied extensively;  the joint effect of productivity and quality parameters on operations sequencing remains practically unexplored. Indeed;  determining the optimal operation sequence has significant implications from both practical and theoretical perspectives. In this paper;  in the framework of Bernoulli reliability and quality models;  we develop effective indicators that are simple and easy to implement in practice to determine the optimal operation sequence that maximizes the system's production rate.
