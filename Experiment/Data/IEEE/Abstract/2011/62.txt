In this paper;  we consider the problem where a point robot in a 2D or 3D environment equipped with an omnidirectional range sensor of finite range D is asked to cover a set of surface patches;  while minimizing the sum of view cost;  proportional to the number of viewpoints planned;  and the travel cost;  proportional to the length of path traveled. We call it the Metric View Planning Problem with Traveling Cost and Visibility Range or Metric TVPP in short. We present a complexity result for the problem;  i.e.;  we show that the Metric TVPP cannot be approximated within O(log m) ratio by any polynomial algorithm;  where m is the number of surface patches to cover. We then analyze a variant of an existing decoupled two-level algorithm of first solving the view planning problem to get an approximate solution;  and then solving;  again using an approximation algorithm;  the Metric traveling salesman problem to connect the planned viewpoints. We then present performance bounds for this two-level decoupled algorithm;  i.e.;  we show that it has an approximation ratio of O(log m). Thus;  it asymptotically achieves the best approximation ratio one can hope for.
