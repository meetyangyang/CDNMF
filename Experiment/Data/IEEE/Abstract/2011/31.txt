This paper addresses the dynamic pricing problem of a single-item;  make-to-stock production system. Demand arrives according to Poisson processes with changeable arrival rate dependent on the selling price. Item processing times follow an Erlang distribution;  which allows to use the information on the production status in a tractable way. The objective is to identify a dynamic control policy that decides production and adjusts the price to maximize the long-run total discounted profit. An optimal policy is based on the so-called work-storage level that captures the information of the inventory level and the status of ongoing production process. Specifically;  we show that: 1) the finished goods inventory is optimally managed by a critical stage level policy: when the inventory is below a certain work-storage level;  production is started if the system is currently idle and 2) the price is optimally set by threshold levels: a certain price is posted when the work-storage level is at or below a threshold corresponding to that level of price. Moreover;  we develop an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal policy.
