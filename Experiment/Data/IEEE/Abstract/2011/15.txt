For short-term scheduling of crude oil operations in refinery;  often crude oil residency time constraint and charging-tank-switch-overlap constraint are ignored by mathematical programming models to make the problem solvable. Thus;  a schedule obtained by such mathematical programming models is infeasible and cannot be deployed. To solve this problem;  this work studies the short-term scheduling problem of crude oil operations in a control theory perspective. The system is modeled by a hybrid Petri net and a short-term schedule is seen as a series of control commands. With this model;  schedulability analysis is carried out and schedulability conditions are presented. These conditions can be used as constraints for finding a realizable and optimal refining schedule. Moreover;  based on the proposed approach;  a detailed schedule can be easily obtained given a realizable refining schedule. In this way;  the complexity for the short-term scheduling problem of crude oil operations in refinery is greatly reduced and effective techniques and tools for practical applications can be obtained.
