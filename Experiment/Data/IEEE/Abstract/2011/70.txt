In this paper;  we consider the problem of allocating machine resources among multiple agents;  each of which is responsible to solve a flowshop scheduling problem. We present an iterated combinatorial auction mechanism in which bid generation is performed within each agent;  while a price adjustment procedure is performed by a centralized auctioneer. While this approach is fairly well-studied in the literature;  our primary innovation is in an adaptive price adjustment procedure;  utilizing variable step-size inspired by adaptive PID-control theory coupled with utility pricing inspired by classical microeconomics. We compare with the conventional price adjustment scheme proposed in Fisher (1985);  and show better convergence properties. Our secondary contribution is in a fast bid-generation procedure executed by the agents based on local search. Putting both these innovations together;  we compare our approach against a classical integer programming model as well as conventional price adjustment schemes;  and show drastic run time improvement with insignificant loss of global optimality.
