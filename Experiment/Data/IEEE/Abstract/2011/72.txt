In the supervisory control theory;  a supervisor is generated based on given plant and specification models. The supervisor restricts the plant in order to fulfill the specifications. A problem that is typically encountered in industrial applications is that the resulting supervisor is not easily comprehensible for the users. To tackle this problem;  we introduce an efficient method to characterize a supervisor by tractable logic conditions;  referred to as guards;  generated from the models. The guards express under which conditions an event is allowed to occur to fulfill the specifications. To obtain tractable guard expressions;  we reduce them by exploiting the structure of the given models. In order to be able to handle complex systems efficiently;  the models are symbolically represented by binary decision diagrams and all computations are performed on these data structures. The algorithms have been implemented in a supervisory control tool and applied to an industrially relevant example.
