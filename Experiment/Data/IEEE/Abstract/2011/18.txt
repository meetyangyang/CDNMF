Using multiple;  heterogeneous sensors in surveillance systems is desirable;  not only to tolerate sensor failures;  but also to increase the accuracy of the event detection process and to provide complementary capability under different operating conditions. In the operation of multiple;  heterogeneous sensors;  we may encounter inconsistent sensor observations. Motivated by the need to make coherent decisions;  we propose in this study a decision scheme to determine the right interpretations of sensor outputs when conflict arises. The proposed decision rule considers sensor heterogeneity in a surveillance system;  while attempting to minimize the expected misclassification cost. Case studies of the surveillance sensor system in a major U.S. port demonstrate that the proposed decision scheme achieves a better robustness in the presence of sensor failures than the popular \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>k</i>\n -out-of-\n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>n</i>\n decision fusion rule.
