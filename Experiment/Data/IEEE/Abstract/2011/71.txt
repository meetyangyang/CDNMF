Condition monitoring (CM) has been recognized as a more effective failure prevention paradigm than the time-based counterpart. CM can be performed via an array of sensors providing multiple;  real-time equipment degradation information with broad coverage. However;  loss of sensor readings due to sensor abnormalities and/or malfunction of connectors has long been a hurdle to reliable fault diagnosis and prognosis in multichannel CM systems. The problem becomes more challenging when the sensor channels are not synchronized because of different sampling rates used and/or time-varying operational schemes. This paper provides a nonparametric sensor recovery technique and a semi-parametric alternative to enhance the robustness of multichannel CM systems. Based on historical data;  models for all the sensor signals are constructed using functional principal component analysis (FPCA);  and functional regression (FR) models are developed for those correlated signals. These models with parameters updated in online implementation can be used to recover the lost sensor signals. A case study of aircraft engines is used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approaches. In addition to recovering asynchronous sensor signals;  the proposed approaches are also compared with the Elman neural network as a popular alternative in recovering synchronous sensor signals.
