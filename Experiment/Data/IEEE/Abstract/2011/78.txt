A new microgripper dedicated to micromanipulation and microassembly tasks is presented in this paper. Based on a new actuator;  called thermo-piezoelectric actuator;  the microgripper presents both a high range and a high positioning resolution. The principle of the microgripper is based on the combination of the thermal actuation (for the coarse positioning) and the piezoelectric actuation (for the fine positioning). In order to improve the performances of the microgripper;  its actuators are modeled and a control law for both the position and the manipulation force is synthesized afterwards. A new control scheme adapted for the actuators of the hybrid thermo-piezoelectric microgripper is therefore proposed. To prove the interest of the developed microgripper and of the proposed control scheme;  the control of a pick-and-release task using this microgripper is carried out. The experimental results confirm their efficiency and demonstrate that the new microgripper and the control law are well suited for micromanipulation and microassembly applications.
