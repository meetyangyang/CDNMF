We present two efficient discrete parameter simulation optimization (DPSO) algorithms for the long-run average cost objective. One of these algorithms uses the smoothed functional approximation (SFA) procedure;  while the other is based on simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). The use of SFA for DPSO had not been proposed previously in the literature. Further;  both algorithms adopt an interesting technique of random projections that we present here for the first time. We give a proof of convergence of our algorithms. Next;  we present detailed numerical experiments on a problem of admission control with dependent service times. We consider two different settings involving parameter sets that have moderate and large sizes;  respectively. On the first setting;  we also show performance comparisons with the well-studied optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) algorithm and also the equal allocation algorithm.
