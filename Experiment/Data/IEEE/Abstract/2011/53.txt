This paper is devoted to multisource renewable energy systems. A modeling approach is proposed that brings a detailed understanding of the coupling and uncoupling of DC/DC power converters on a DC bus including the regulation of the DC bus voltage and the driving of current provided by each converter to the load. This approach is systematic and the resulting average state-space model depends only on the number and characteristics of the converters. The model has a generic expression the parameters of which switch according to the converters coupling and uncoupling on the DC bus. The model has been identified and validated with an experimental device developed by GREAH Research Group for the optimization of energies transfers for multisource renewable energy systems. Our approach can be used in the context of power management as support for performance evaluation (converter design;  supervisory control design;  and so on).
