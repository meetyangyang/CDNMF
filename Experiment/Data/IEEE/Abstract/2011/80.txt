As an emerging non-parametric modeling technique;  the methodology of support vector regression blazed a new trail in identifying complex nonlinear systems with superior generalization capability and sparsity. Nevertheless;  the conventional quadratic programming support vector regression can easily lead to representation redundancy and expensive computational cost. In this paper;  by using the \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>l</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>1</sub>\n norm minimization and taking account of the different characteristics of autoregression (AR) and the moving average (MA);  an innovative nonlinear dynamical system identification approach;  linear programming SVM-ARMA\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2K</sub>\n;  is developed to enhance flexibility and secure model sparsity in identifying nonlinear dynamical systems. To demonstrate the potential and practicality of the proposed approach;  the proposed strategy is applied to identify a representative dynamical engine model.
