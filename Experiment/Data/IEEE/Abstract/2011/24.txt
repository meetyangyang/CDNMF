Color grading is a crucial step in the processing of fruits and vegetables that directly affects profitability;  because the quality of agricultural products is often associated with their color. Most existing automatic color grading systems determine color quality either by directly comparing product color against a predefined and fixed set of reference colors or by using a set of color separating parameters;  often in three-dimensional color spaces. Using these methods;  it is not convenient for the user to adjust color preferences or grading parameters. In this paper;  we present an effective and user-friendly color mapping concept for automated color grading that is well suited for commercial production. User friendliness is often viewed by the industry as a very important factor to the acceptance and success of automation equipment. This color mapping method uses preselected colors of interest specific to a given application to calculate a unique set of coefficients for color space conversion. The three-dimensional RGB color space is converted into a small set of color indices unique to the application. In contrast with more complex color grading techniques;  the proposed method makes it easy for a human operator to specify and adjust color-preference settings Tomato and date maturity evaluation and date surface defect detection are used to demonstrate the performance of this novel color mapping concept.
