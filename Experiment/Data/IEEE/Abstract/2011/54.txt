In this paper;  we propose a novel efficient frame slotted aloha (EFSA) protocol for radio frequency identification (RFID) tag anticollision in this paper. After successfully identifying each tag;  the EFSA protocol will allocate the tag a slot number;  which signifies when the tag could be identified during a read cycle. When no tags arrive and leave;  idle slots and collision slots will not be produced in subsequent read cycles. In addition;  if there is a collision slot in the EFSA protocol;  colliding tags in the collision slot will be resolved by \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>Q</i>\n -ary splitting where \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>Q</i>\n is equal to the estimated number of colliding tags;  while the other unidentified tags is in a waiting state until the colliding tags are successfully resolved. Since allocation of tags to slots is not random in the EFSA protocol;  conventional tag quantity estimates are not suitable. Therefore;  we also propose a novel tag quantity estimate for the EFSA protocol. Simulation results show that the EFSA protocol outperforms conventional protocols;  in term of time slots of reidentifying tags;  and the proposed estimate error is less than the conventional estimates in the EFSA protocol.
