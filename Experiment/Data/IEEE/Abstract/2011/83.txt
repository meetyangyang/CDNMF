Long-term scheduling for cascaded hydro energy systems is very important for low carbon energy production. It aims at determining the water release over a planning horizon to meet water resource requirements and the system demands for electric power. The problem is challenging in view of the complicated and stochastic system dynamics;  nonlinear marginal cost;  coupled hydraulic constraints;  and the large problem size. In this paper we formulate the long-term scheduling problem of cascaded hydro energy systems with annual consumption and release constraints as a finite horizon constrained Markov decision process (CMDP);  and develop a new rollout algorithm to optimize the policies. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the formulation and the new algorithm.
