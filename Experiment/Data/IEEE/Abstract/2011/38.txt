A new approach to compensate the strong hysteresis nonlinearity in piezoelectric materials is proposed. Based on the inverse multiplicative scheme;  the approach avoids models inversion as employed in existing works. The compensator is therefore simple to implement and does not require additional computation as soon as the direct model is available. The proposed compensation technique is valuable for hysteresis that are modeled with the Bouc-Wen set of equations.
