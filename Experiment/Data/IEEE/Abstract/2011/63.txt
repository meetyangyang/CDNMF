Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a ubiquitous wireless technology which allows objects to be identified automatically. An RFID tag is a small electronic device with an antenna and has a unique serial number. For some RFID applications and in the ALOHA-based anticollision algorithms;  the number of tags in the system needs to be estimated. In Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.;  vol 6;  no. 1;  pp. 9-15;  Jan. 2009;  Chen;  a probabilistic method for tag estimation in ALOHA-based RFID systems was proposed;  based on the maximum a posteriori probability. Although this approach is novel and useful;  it has a mathematical error in modeling the problem. In this short paper;  we address this problem and provide the correct probabilistic model for the ALOHA-based RFID systems. Some consequences of correcting the error in Trans. Autom. Sci. Eng.;  vol 6;  no. 1;  pp. 9-15;  Jan. 2009;  Chen;  are discussed and the model is validated via simulation. Using the correct model;  the performance of the ALOHA-based anticollision algorithm can be improved.
