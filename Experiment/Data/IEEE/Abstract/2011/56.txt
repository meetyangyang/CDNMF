This paper describes a test-bed for planar micro and mesoscale manipulation tasks and a framework for planning based on quasi-static models of mechanical systems with intermittent frictional contacts. We show how planar peg-in-the-hole assembly tasks can be designed using randomized motion planning techniques with Mason's models for quasi-static manipulation. Simulation and experimental results are presented in support of our methodology. We develop this further into a systematic approach to incorporating uncertainty into planning manipulation tasks with frictional contacts. We again consider the canonical problem of assembling a peg into a hole at the mesoscale using probes with minimal actuation but with visual feedback from an optical microscope. We consider three sources of uncertainty. First;  because of errors in sensing position and orientation of the parts to be assembled;  we must consider uncertainty in the sensed configuration of the system. Second;  there is uncertainty because of errors in actuation. Third;  there are geometric and physical parameters characterizing the environment that are unknown. We discuss the synthesis of robust planning primitives using a single degree-of-freedom probe and the automated generation of plans for mesoscale manipulation. We show simulation and experimental results of our work.
