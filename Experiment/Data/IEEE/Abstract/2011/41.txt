Topological structure is considered more and more important in managing a supply network or predicting its development. In this paper;  a new framework is proposed to model the topological structure of supply networks;  where different types of supply networks can be created just by introducing different supplier-customer connecting rules. Generally;  the networks created in the framework are much different from the random networks with the same degree sequences. The revealed phenomenon suggests that real-world supply networks may benefit from its intrinsic mechanism on flexibility;  efficiency;  and robustness to target attacks.
