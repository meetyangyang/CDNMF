For some wafer fabrication processes in cluster tools;  e.g.;  atomic layer deposition (ALD);  wafer revisiting is required. Typically;  in such processes;  wafers need to visit two consecutive processing steps several times. Such a revisiting process can be denoted as (mi;  mi + 1)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>h</sup>\n;  where i means the ith-step and m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n and m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i + 1</sub>\n mean the corresponding quantity of the processing modules in i and (i+1)th steps;  and h the number of visiting times. This paper conducts a study for scheduling single-arm cluster tools with such a wafer revisiting process. The system is modeled by Petri nets (PNs) to guarantee the feasibility of robot activities. Based on the model;  a deadlock avoidance policy is presented. With the control policy;  cycle time analysis for the revisiting process is made. With the fact that wafer processing times are much longer than robot movement times in cluster tools;  it is shown that;  when m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n = m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i + 1</sub>\n = 1;  i.e.;  each step has only one processing module;  the optimal one-wafer cyclic schedule is deterministic and unique;  and the minimal cycle time can be calculated by an analytical expression. It is also shown that;  when m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n = 1 and m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n + 1 = 2 or m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n = 2 and m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>i</sub>\n + 1 = 1;  the optimal one-wafer cyclic schedule can be obtained by finding h deterministic schedules and the one with the least cycle time. A novel analytical method is finally presented to schedule the overall system containing such reentrant wafer flow. This represents a significant advance in single-arm cluster equipment automation.
