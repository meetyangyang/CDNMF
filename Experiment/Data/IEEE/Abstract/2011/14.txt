This paper proposes a general scheduling model that extends job-shop scheduling models to incorporate important features of real manufacturing systems. More precisely;  each operation can be performed in different modes and requires a different set of resources depending on the mode. Further;  we consider blocking constraints that requires to hold resources used for an operation till resources needed for the next operation of the same job are available. A shortest path approach extending the classical geometric approach is proposed for the two-job case. A greedy heuristic is then proposed to schedule \n<i xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>N</i>\n jobs by considering jobs sequentially;  grouping scheduled jobs into a combined job and then scheduling it and the next unscheduled job using the shortest path approach. A metaheuristic is then used to identify effective job sequences. Extensive numerical experimentation proves the efficiency of our approach.
