Association Link Network (ALN) aims to establish associated relations among various resources. By extending the hyperlink network World Wide Web to an association-rich network;  ALN is able to effectively support Web intelligence activities such as Web browsing;  Web knowledge discovery;  and publishing;  etc. Since existing methods for building semantic link on Web resources cannot effectively and automatically organize loose Web resources;  effective Web intelligence activities are still challenging. In this paper;  a discovery algorithm of associated resources is first proposed to build original ALN for organizing loose Web resources. Second;  three schemas for constructing kernel ALN and connection-rich ALN (C-ALN) are developed gradually to optimize the organizing of Web resources. After that;  properties of different types of ALN are discussed;  which show that C-ALN has good performances to support Web intelligence activities. Moreover;  an evaluation method is presented to verify the correctness of C-ALN for semantic link on documents. Finally;  an application using C-ALN to organize Web services is presented;  which shows that C-ALN is an effective and efficient tool for building semantic link on the resources of Web services.
