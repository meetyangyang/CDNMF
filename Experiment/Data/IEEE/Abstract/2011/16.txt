Surface flattening has numerous applications in sheet manufacturing industries;  such as garment industry;  shoe industry;  toy industry;  furniture industry;  and ship industry. Motivated by the requirements of those industries;  WireWarping approach presented by Wang;  2008 is exploited to generate 2-D patterns with invariant length of feature and boundary curves. However;  strict length constraints on all feature curves sometimes cause large distortions on 2-D patterns;  especially for those 3-D surfaces which are highly non-developable. In this paper;  we present a flexible and robust extension of WireWarping by introducing a new type of feature curves named elastic feature;  which brings flexibility to shape control of the resultant 2-D patterns. On these new feature curves;  instead of strictly preserving the exact lengths;  only the ranges of their lengths are controlled. To achieve this function;  a multiloop shape control optimization framework is proposed to find the optimized 2-D shape among all possible flattening results with different length variations on those elastic feature curves;  while the lengths of other feature curves are kept unchanged. Besides;  we also present a topology processing algorithm on the network of feature curves to eliminate cases that lead to numerical singularity. Experimental results show that the WireWarping++ can successfully flatten surface patches into 2-D patterns with more flexible shape control and more robust numerical performance.
