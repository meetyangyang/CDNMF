Cluster tools (also referred to as robotic cells) are extensively used in semiconductor wafer fabrication. We consider the problem of scheduling operations in an m -machine cluster tool that produces identical parts (wafers). Each machine is equipped with a unit-capacity input buffer and a unit-capacity output buffer. The machines and buffers are served by a dual-gripper robot. Each wafer is processed on each of the m machines;  and the objective is to find a cyclic sequence of robot moves that minimizes the long-run average time to produce a part or;  equivalently;  maximizes the throughput. We first obtain a tight upper bound on the optimal throughput and then use this bound to obtain an asymptotically optimal sequence under conditions that are common in practice. Next;  we quantify the improvement in productivity that can be realized from the use of unit-capacity input and output buffers at the machines. Finally;  we illustrate our analysis on cluster tools with realistic parameters;  based on our work with a Dallas-based semiconductor equipment manufacturer.
