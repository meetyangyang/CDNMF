Soft robots must be able to structure an automation problem into a sequence of actions that lead to a desired state;  before they can fulfill a meaningful role in automation applications. This;  however;  can only be successful if the robot can predict the outcome of an action. The theory of rigid industrial robots is not applicable without major changes;  because kinematic chains do not adequately describe the continuous deformation of the complex;  often biologically inspired shapes of soft robots. Analytic solutions have not been found yet. Numerical solutions based on finite elements are slow;  technically challenging;  and only suitable for one specific robot. It is;  however;  possible to observe the outcome of an action;  and use these observations to plan a sequence of actions that let the robot accomplish an automation task. In this paper;  we analyze a probabilistic automaton that computes the optimal sequence of actions to bring the robot into a desired state. An earlier article explained the functioning of the method in a toy example. In this paper;  we analyze if it is feasible to apply the method to a planning problem inspired by a real soft robot. We show the results and document the planning process. We identify the analog of an impulse response;  although it is not closed form due to the nonparametric nature of the method.
