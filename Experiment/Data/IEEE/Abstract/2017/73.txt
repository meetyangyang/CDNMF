While the supervisory control (SC) problem of (maximally permissive) deadlock avoidance for sequential resource allocation systems (RASs) has been extensively studied in the literature;  the corresponding results that are able to address potential resource outages are quite limited;  both;  in terms of their volume and their control capability. This paper leverages the recently developed SC theory for switched discrete event systems (s-DES) in order to provide a novel systematic treatment of this more complicated version of the RAS deadlock avoidance problem. Following the modeling paradigm of s-DES;  both the operation of the considered RAS and the corresponding maximally permissive SC policy are decomposed over a number of operational modes that are defined by the running sets of the failing resources. In particular;  the target supervisor must be decomposed to a set of “localized predicates; ” where each predicate is associated with one of the operational modes. A significant part;  and a primary contribution;  of this paper concerns the development of these localized predicates that will enable the formal characterization and the effective computation of the sought supervisor. With these predicates available;  a distributed representation for the sought supervisor that is appropriate for real-time implementation is eventually obtained through an adaptation of the relevant distributed algorithm that is provided by the current s-DES SC theory.
