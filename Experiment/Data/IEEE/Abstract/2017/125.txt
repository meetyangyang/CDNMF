Complex systems often consist of multiple units that are required to work together in parallel to satisfy a specific engineering objective. As an example;  in manufacturing processes;  several identical machines may need to operate together to simultaneously fabricate the same products in order to meet the high production demand. This parallel configuration is often designed with some level of redundancy to compensate for unexpected events. In this way;  when only a small portion of units fail to operate due to either unexpected machine downtime or scheduled maintenance;  the remaining units can still achieve the engineering objective by increasing their workloads up to the designed capacities. However;  the workload of a unit apparently impacts the unit's degradation rate as well as its failure time. Specifically;  this paper considers the case that a higher workload assignment accelerates the unit's degradation and vice versa. Based on this assumption;  we develop a method to actively control the degradation as well as the predicted failure time of each unit by dynamically adjusting its workloads. Our goal is to prevent the overlap of unit failures within a certain time period through taking advantage of the natural redundancy of the parallel structure;  which may potentially lead to a better utilization of maintenance resources as well as a consistently ensured system throughput. A numerical study is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different scenarios.
