Terrain information can significantly impact load power demand;  and in turn;  on battery life and system efficiency of a hybrid energy storage system (ESS) with battery and supercapacitor. Taking terrain information ahead into consideration for proactive power management is one of the most important ways to improve battery life and overall system efficiency. However;  since terrain information is typically available from commercial geographic information systems database;  it is by nature inaccurate with uncertainties with respect to the requirements of power management. This is often worsening when combining with commercially low-quality global positioning systems. This paper proposes a novel power management strategy to cope with the inaccuracy and uncertainties of the terrain information with the aim to improve battery life;  while maintaining overall system performance. First;  the impact of terrain inaccuracy on battery life and system efficiency is analyzed based on two different hybrid ESSs with semiactive topologies. Then;  a power management control strategy is developed that actively distributes the power between battery and supercapacitor with adaptation to terrain inaccuracy and uncertainties. The objective of the proposed power management control strategy is to minimize the total cost of the system;  including the cost for battery life and energy. Finally;  simulation is conducted that has verified the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
