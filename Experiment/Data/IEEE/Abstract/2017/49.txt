This paper proposes a new compliant gripper with integrated position and force sensors dedicated to automated microassembly tasks. The uniqueness of the gripper is that it possesses a large gripping range with a bidirectional drive;  and it is capable of detecting grasping force and environmental interaction forces in horizonal and vertical axes;  respectively. This is enabled by a mechanism design based on a rotary flexure bearing. Moreover;  a compliant mechanism with two-stage stiffness is designed to provide the force sensing with dual sensitivities and measuring ranges to accommodate the grasp of objects with different sizes and weights. Analytical models are derived to predict the grasping range;  force sensing sensitivities;  and ranges. These models are verified by conducting finite-element analysis simulations. A proof-of-concept prototype gripper is developed for experimental calibration and performance testing. Results reveal that the single set of strain-gauge force sensor is able to detect both grasping and interaction forces in an alternate manner. The dual-sensitivity;  dual-range force sensor provides a solution to large-range gripper with finer and coarser force sensing in a small and large ranges;  respectively.
