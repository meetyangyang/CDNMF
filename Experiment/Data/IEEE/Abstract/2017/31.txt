New connection constraints for the power network (grid codes) require more flexible and reliable systems;  with robust solutions to cope with uncertainties and intermittence from renewable energy sources (renewables);  such as photovoltaic (PV) arrays. The interconnection of such renewables with storage systems through a direct current (DC) MicroGrid can fulfill these requirements. A “Plug and Play” approach based on the “System of Systems” philosophy using distributed control methodologies is developed in this paper. This approach allows to interconnect a number of elements to a DC MicroGrid as power sources;  such as PV arrays;  storage systems in different time scales;  such as batteries and supercapacitors;  and loads;  such as electric vehicles and the main ac grid. The proposed scheme can easily be scalable to a much larger number of elements.
