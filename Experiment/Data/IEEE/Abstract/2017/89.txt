Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology;  based on wireless communication between a reader and tags;  is the most popular technology for indoor item identification and tracking. Among competing RFID technologies;  Gen2 has emerged as the most popular one;  due to the best price/performance ratio. In order to communicate with multiple tags;  Gen2 RFID systems use dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (DFSA) as a medium access control (MAC) mechanism. To maximize DFSA throughput simple calculations show that the number of tags should equal the DFSA frame size. However;  the number of tags in an environment is usually unknown and has to be estimated. So far;  significant effort has been invested in estimating the correct number of tags. However;  to the best of our knowledge;  no one has explored the estimator performance in a real RFID measuring scenario. In this paper;  we evaluate the throughput of a real RFID system by using the Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology. Our results show that phenomena related to radio waves propagation and reception have a significantly bigger influence on Gen2 RFID throughput than traditional approaches take into account.
