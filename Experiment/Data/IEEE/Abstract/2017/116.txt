Particle filtering (PF) is an eminent simulation-based state estimation technique;  which is capable of handling massive data sets and diverse external factors. Here;  an effective selection of the importance density plays a pivotal role in performances of PFs by not only preventing degeneracy problems at early stages of process;  but also taking both the transition prior and likelihood into account when the likelihood appears in the tail of the prior. To this end;  we propose a novel importance density selection scheme for PF based on the minimum relative entropy principle. Theoretical derivation of the proposed scheme is presented;  and its effectiveness is evaluated against various sampling schemes that exist in the literature using synthetic experiments. Finally;  the performance of the proposed minimum relative entropy-based density selection scheme is successfully demonstrated for short-term electricity demand forecasting of a company located in Miami;  FL;  USA.
