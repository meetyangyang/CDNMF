For distributed discrete-event systems (DESs);  which are specified by a set of coupled automata;  the centralized synthesis for a composed plant model is often undesired due to a high computational effort and the need to subsequently split the result into local controllers. This paper proposes modeling and synthesis procedures to obtain optimal decentralized controllers in state-feedback form for distributed DES. In particular;  this paper addresses the DES with priority structures;  in which subsystems with high priorities are supplied with the output of subsystems with lower priority. If the subsystem dependencies have linear or treelike structures;  the synthesis of the subsystem controllers can be accomplished separately. Any local controller is computed by algebraic computations;  it communicates with controllers of adjacent subsystems;  and it aims at transferring the corresponding subsystem into goal states with a minimal sum of transfer costs. As is shown for an example;  the computational effort can be significantly reduced compared with the synthesis of centralized controllers following the composition of all subsystem models.
