One of the greatest challenges in microrobotics is the development of robotic devices for high-speed transportation and precise positioning of microcomponents. This paper proposes to use non contact magnetic actuation in which objects are placed at the air/liquid interface and are actuated through magnetic field gradients. A physical model is developed and identified to perform closed-loop control. This approach is validated through several experiments in 1-D. Precise positioning and high-speed trajectory tracking of objects smaller than 100 μm are achieved. The position error of an object of 60 × 50 × 25 μm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\n is less than 10% of its size and the maximum velocity reached is about 6 mm/. The closed-loop control has been tested on objects as small as 30 × 20 × 25 μm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>3</sup>\n and demonstrates its ability to perform precise positioning (the position error is less than 7% of the size of the object). This approach represents a promising solution to design devices for high throughput transportation and precise positioning of micro-objects;  which will lead to magnetic smart surfaces at micrometer scale.
