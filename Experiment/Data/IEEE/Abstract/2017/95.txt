In this paper;  we analyze some recently proposed radio-frequency identification group codes based on low-density parity-check matrices that check the integrity of collections of tagged objects. These codes write additional data to the memory of tags to compute the number of missing tags. By studying the underlying requirements for these computations;  we obtain bounds and show that there are simpler group codes that perform better;  requiring less tag memory.
