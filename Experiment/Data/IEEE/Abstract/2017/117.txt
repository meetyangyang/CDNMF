In a mobile radio-frequency identification (RFID) system;  tagged items enter and leave the reader's field at a constant speed. The possibility of tags leaving the reader's interrogation zone without being identified is known as tag loss. Minimizing the tag loss ratio in the presence of random denial-of-service (DoS) attacking signals by optimizing the number of frames is investigated in this paper. The results show that the number of frame control is not needed to reduce the tag loss ratio if the tag entering rate is below a critical limit. The number of frames has to abruptly reduce to keep the tag loss ratio lower if the tag entering rate exceeds that critical limit. This critical limit of the tag entering rate is derived analytically. An analytical solution of the optimum number of frames in the presence of attacking signals that also minimize the tag loss ratio is devised. The technique for setting the optimum number of frames is also presented. The presented results in this paper with random DoS attacking signals is so general that those can be converted without DoS attacking signals by setting the DoS attacking signals equal to zero. The results of this paper can be used for mobile RFID system design with and without DoS attacking signals.
