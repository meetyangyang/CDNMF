In this paper;  a hybrid multi-objective scheme is proposed to complete simultaneously four objectives;  i.e.;  the specified primary task for the end-effector;  obstacle avoidance;  joint-physical limits avoidance;  and repetitive motion of redundant robot manipulators. In addition;  corresponding theoretical analysis is given;  which guarantees the validity of the proposed scheme. Then;  the proposed hybrid multi-objective scheme is reformulated as a dynamical quadratic program (DQP) problem. The optimal solution of the DQP problem is found by the PLPE (piecewise-linear projection equation) neural network;  i.e.;  PLPENN;  and also by the corresponding numerical algorithm implemented on the computer. Furthermore;  simulation and comparison based on a six-link planar redundant robot manipulator substantiate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed scheme. At last;  a hardware experiment is conducted on a six-link physical robot manipulator system;  which substantiates the physical realizability;  operational stability;  and safety of the proposed hybrid multi-objective scheme.
