In this paper;  the distributed consensus problem for a class of multiple Euler-Lagrange systems is solved. The considered issues are: 1) sampled-data information; 2) transmission delay; and 3) data packet dropouts. The considered mathematical models can describe a large number of practical systems in the actual engineering. In particular;  all of the information exchanges are modeled by a sample-and-hold mechanism;  which is more reliable and practical in applications. Moreover;  this framework can deal with time-varying transmission delays and data packet dropouts by taking into account the limited communication capacity of information exchanges. By utilizing model transformation and applying the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method;  sufficient conditions are first established with single-packet information exchanges to ensure that the networked Euler-Lagrange systems can achieve consensus under undirected communication topology. Then;  the obtained results are further extended to the multiple-packet transmission case. Finally;  an example of four two-link manipulators with time-varying transmission delays and data packet dropouts is addressed to verify the effectiveness and applicability of our theoretical results.
