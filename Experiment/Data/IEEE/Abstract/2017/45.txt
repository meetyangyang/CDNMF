This paper presents planning algorithms for robotic cleaning of stains on nonplanar surfaces. Access to different portions of the stain may require frequent repositioning and reorienting of the object. Some portions with prominent stain may require multiple passes to remove the stain completely. Two robotic arms have been used in the experiments. The object is immobilized with one arm and the cleaning tool is manipulated with the other. The algorithm generates a sequence of reorientation and repositioning moves required to clean the part after analyzing the stain. The plan is generated by accounting for the kinematic constraints of the robot. Our algorithm uses a depth-first branch-and-bound search to generate setup plans. Cleaning trajectories are generated and optimal cleaning parameters are selected by the algorithm. We have validated our approach through numerical simulations and robotic cleaning experiments with two KUKA robots.
