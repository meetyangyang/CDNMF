This paper describes a novel methodology to reduce the effort in automating manual surface finishing processes by bridging the knowledge transfer gap of the manual operator's skills to a robot program. Key process variables (KPVs);  i.e.;  contact force;  tool path;  and feed rate;  of the manual operator performing the task are captured with a “sensorized” hand-held belt grinder;  while the changes to the work-piece geometry is captured using a 3-D scanner. The entire manual tool-path strategy is segmented into its primitives or primary strategies before programming an equivalent robotic tool-path and strategy. The manual tool-path primitives are imported into computer-aided-manufacturing software where boundary splines are created to generate the robotic tool-paths. An analytical material removal rate (MRR) model is used to scale the extracted manual KPVs such that the parameters can be executed by the robotic platform;  while still maintaining an equivalent material removal profile. In the first experimental trial with the designed robotic finishing strategy using this approach;  the work-piece could be finished to within 0.7 mm of the desired shape.
