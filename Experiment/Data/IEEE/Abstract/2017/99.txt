This paper specifies a cloud-based cooperative decision support system (DSS) that aims at integrating logistics management and decision support strategies for intermodal transportation systems. The proposed DSS is dedicated to synchronize different transportation means by using the modern information and communications technology tools and by taking into account environmental aspects. This paper describes the DSS cloud-based architecture and presents the procedure to be followed in order to design a DSS able to support decision makers in different logistic decision fields. The advantages of the proposed DSS are enlightened by specifying three main decision modules: cargo transport optimization;  intelligent truck parking;  and CO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sub>\n monitoring. Moreover;  the applicability of the proposed DSS is described by specifying a DSS for the case study of the logistic network of the Trieste port (Italy);  including the port;  the inland terminal;  and the highway connecting them. Some simulation campaigns are employed both to set the decision modules and evaluate the DSS application benefits.
