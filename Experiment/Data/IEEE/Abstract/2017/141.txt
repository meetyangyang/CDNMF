Cycling induced by automatic control of functional electrical stimulation provides a means of therapeutic exercise and functional restoration for people affected by paralysis. During cycling induced by functional electrical stimulation;  various muscle groups are stimulated according to the cycle crank angle; however;  because of kinematic constraints on the cycle-rider system;  stimulation is typically only applied in a subsection of the crank cycle. Therefore;  these systems can be considered as switched control systems with autonomous;  state-dependent switching with potentially unstable modes. Previous studies have included an electric motor in the system to provide additional control authority;  but no studies have considered the effects of switched control in the stability analysis of the motorized functional electrical stimulation cycling system. In this paper;  a model of the motorized cycle-rider system with functional electrical stimulation is developed that includes the effects of a switched control input. A novel switching strategy for the electric motor is designed to only provide assistance in the regions of the crank cycle where the kinematic effectiveness of the rider's muscles is low. A switched sliding-mode controller is designed;  and global;  exponentially stable tracking of a desired crank trajectory is guaranteed via Lyapunov methods for switched systems;  despite parametric uncertainty in the nonlinear model and unknown;  time-varying disturbances. Experimental results from five able-bodied;  passive riders are presented to validate the control design;  and the developed control system achieves an average cadence tracking error of \n<formula formulatype=\inline\ xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\><tex Notation=\TeX\>$0.00\\pm 2.91$</tex></formula>\n revolutions per minute for a desired trajectory of 50 revolutions per minute.
