Considering the operation process rebuilding (OPR) of manufacturing/operation systems;  we propose a dynamic interactive bilevel maintenance methodology to satisfy rapid market changes. Predictive maintenance (PdM) intervals at the machine level are dynamically scheduled by a multiobjective model for each diverse machine. A system-level opportunistic maintenance (OM) policy is proposed to facilitate PdM optimizations according to OPR activities. This novel OPR-OM policy utilizes a variable maintenance time window to construct optimal maintenance schedules that are suitable for changeable system structures. The results obtained by applying this methodology at Shanghai Port indicate that the proposed methodology can help a port transportation system to achieve rapid responses to OPR activities;  which can significantly improve system efficiency and economy.
