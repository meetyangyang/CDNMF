The multifunction robotic cell scheduling problem has been recently studied in the literature. The main assumption in the pertaining literature is that a multifunction robot performs an operation on the part during any loaded move between two adjacent processing stages. For a two-machine cell;  these stages are the input hopper;  the first machine;  the second machine and the output hopper. Consequently;  the multifunction robot performs three operations with fixed processing times. In contrast;  we assume a class of two-machine cells where none of the processing times of three operations are fixed. However;  their summation is fixed and equivalent to the processing time of the unique operation. The processing mode of the unique operation performed by the multifunction robot is “stop resume.” Thus;  regardless of the gap interrupts during operations by two machines;  the robot continues performing the unique operation of the part when it is reloaded to the robot without any loss of time. The focus lies on n-unit cycles due to their popularity. It is proven one-unit cycles have better performance for the problem under study. The cycle time of one-unit cycles are obtained and optimality conditions are determined for different pickup criteria: free;  interval;  and no-wait.
