Medical staff configuration is a critical problem in the management of an emergency department (ED) in Hong Kong (HK). Given the service requirements by HK government;  it is imperative for the hospital managers to develop medical staff configuration in a cost-and-time-effective way. In this paper;  the medical staff configuration problem in ED is modeled as minimizing the total labor cost while satisfying the service quality requirements. To solve this issue;  we propose a highly efficient search method;  called random boundary generation with feasibility detection (RBG-FD). The random boundary generation (RBG) is applied to efficiently identify good-quality solutions based on the objective value. The feasibility detection (FD) procedure is used to retain the probability of correct feasibility detection of each sampled solution at the desired level;  which intrinsically allocates a reasonable number of simulation replications. To estimate the performance measures of the ED;  a discrete-event simulation model is developed to reflect the patient flow. Using these techniques;  the efficiency of identifying the optimal staff configuration can be significantly improved. A case study is performed in a public hospital in HK. The numerical results indicate significantly higher practicability and efficiency of the proposed method with different patient arrival rates and service constraints.
