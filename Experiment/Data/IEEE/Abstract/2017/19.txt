Multiresolution metrology devices coexist in today's manufacturing environment;  producing coordinate measurements complementing each other. Typically;  the high-resolution (HR) device produces a scarce but accurate data set;  whereas the low-resolution (LR) one produces a dense but less accurate data set. Research has shown that combining the two data sets of different resolutions makes better predictions of the geometric features of a manufactured part. A challenge;  however;  is how to effectively match each HR data point to an LR counterpart that measures approximately the same physical location. A solution to this matching problem appears a prerequisite to a good final prediction. We solved this problem by formulating it as a quadratic integer program;  aiming at minimizing the maximum interpoint distance difference among all potential correspondences. Due to the combinatorial nature of the optimization model;  solving it to optimality is computationally prohibitive even for a small problem size. We therefore propose a two-stage matching framework capable of solving real-life-sized problems within a reasonable amount of time. This two-stage framework consists of downsampling the full-size problem;  solving the downsampled problem to optimality;  extending the solution of the downsampled problem to the full-size problem;  and refining the solution using iterative local search. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms two popular point set registration alternatives;  the iterative closest point and coherent point drift methods;  using different performance metrics. The numerical results also show that our approach scales much better as the instance size increases;  and is robust to the changes in initial misalignment between the two data sets.
