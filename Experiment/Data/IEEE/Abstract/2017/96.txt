A methodology is proposed for production optimization of oilfields consisting of multiple offshore reservoirs. In such complex systems;  several production units are interconnected by a subsea pipeline network that transfers fluids to onshore terminals. A graph-based model of production units;  pipelines;  and nonlinear phenomena leads to a mixed-integer nonlinear problem for production optimization. Owing to its sheer size;  the proposed approach relies on piecewise-linear proxy modeling of the production units and fluid flow. The end result is a mixed-integer linear problem to which robust algorithms can be applied. By means of simulation;  the methodology is tested for an offshore oilfield in the Santos Basin;  encompassing multiple reservoirs and production platforms.
