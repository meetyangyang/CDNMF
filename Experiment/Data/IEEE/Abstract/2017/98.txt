Manufacturing systems are becoming more and more flexible to confront uncertainty in demands of multiple product types. In this paper;  we study the properties of flexible manufacturing systems from the perspective of demand shortfall and service level as functions of setup time;  nonhomogeneous capacities;  and demand distributions. Closed-form bounds as well as an accurate estimate of the service level are obtained. Sensitivity analyses of service level with respect to reductions in setup time;  downtime;  and cycle time are carried out;  and the impact of new product launch and product correlation on system flexibility is investigated.
