While cryptography is used to protect the content of information (e.g.;  a message) by making it undecipherable;  behaviors (as opposed to information) may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity (by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from secrets). Having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret;  yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper;  we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems;  which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions;  one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period;  our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation for the proposed measure is also presented. Illustrative examples;  including the one with side-channel attack;  are provided to demonstrate the proposed computation approach.
