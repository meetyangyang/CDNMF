In some of recent advances in automation of construction equipment;  much research has been conducted on the control of hydraulic excavators in both industry and academia for the benefit of safety and efficiency. However;  most relevant works have employed model-based control approaches that require a mathematical representation of the target plant. For hydraulic excavators;  obtaining a useful dynamic model for control can be challenging due to the nonlinearity of the hydraulic servo system. With this in mind;  this paper investigates the feasibility of an online learning control framework based on echo-state networks (ESNs) to the position control of hydraulic excavators. While ESNs are a class of recurrent neural networks;  the training of ESNs corresponds to solving a linear regression problem;  thus making it suitable for online implementation. By exploiting the dynamic properties of ESNs;  the deployed control framework uses the input and output signals of the plant to learn an inverse model;  which is then used to simultaneously generate control inputs to track the desired trajectory. Experiments conducted on a 21-ton class hydraulic excavator show the promising results in that accurate tracking is achieved even in the absence of a dynamic model.
