Performance tracking;  consisting of system state identification;  fault detection;  and propagation prediction;  is critical to system operation optimization and maintenance scheduling. It is typical that dynamic systems degrade in a nonlinear manner;  often times accompanied by abrupt fault occurrences;  before and after which the degradation rate varies. Commonly used state estimation techniques for uncertainty evaluation;  such as extended or unscented Kalman filter and particle filter (PF);  are suited for nonlinear system state tracking without abrupt transient phenomena. To address this challenge;  an integrated performance tracking technique is developed. It consists of a local search PF;  which can dynamically adjust its resampling operation to avoid sample impoverishment as is commonly seen in conventional PFs;  and a total variation filter;  which can detect transient changes in the system states due to abrupt fault occurrence. The developed technique is evaluated for fault detection and performance tracking of a heat exchanger;  which is a key component in the heating;  ventilation;  and air conditioning system. The performance of the developed technique is first evaluated using a finite element model of a heat exchanger;  under both normal and faulty conditions. Subsequently;  evaluation using experimental data provided by the American Society of Heating;  Refrigeration;  and AC Engineering was performed. The results have confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the developed technique in fault detection and performance degradation tracking involving complex fault propagation scenarios.
