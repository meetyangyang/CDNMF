Due to the limits of battery capacity of mobile devices;  how to select cloud services to invoke in order to reduce energy consumption in mobile environments is becoming a critical issue. This paper addresses the problem of mobile service selection for composition in terms of energy consumption. It formally models this problem and constructs energy consumption computation models. Energy consumption aggregation rules for composite services with different structures are presented. It adopts the genetic algorithm to resolve it. A replanning mechanism is also proposed to deal with the changeable conditions and user behavior. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our method. The results show that our service selection method significantly outperforms traditional methods. Even if the conditions or user behavior is changeable;  this method is still effective to recommend services. Moreover;  the service selection method performs good scalability as the experimental scale increases.
