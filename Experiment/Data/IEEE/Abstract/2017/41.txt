This paper;  as an outcome of the EU project AREUS;  heralds an optimization procedure that reduces up to 30% of energy consumption and up to 60% in peak power for the trajectories that have been tested on real industrial robots. We have evaluated a number of cost functions and tested our algorithm for a variety of scenarios such as varying cycle times;  payloads;  and single/multirobot cases in both ac- and dc-operated robot cells. The significance of our work is not only in the impressive savings;  simplicity of implementation;  and preserving path and cycle time;  but also in the variety of test scenarios that include different kinds of KUKA robots. We have carried out the optimization and experiments in as realistic conditions as possible.
