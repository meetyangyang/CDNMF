Cable-conduit mechanism (CCM) is widely used in robotic hands;  rescue robots;  rehabilitation robots;  and surgical robots because it offers efficient transmission of forces/torques from the external actuator to the end effector with lightweight and high flexibility. However;  the accurate position control is challenging in such mechanism due to friction and backlash-like hysteresis between the cable and the conduit. In this paper;  a new control approach is proposed to enhance the trajectory tracking performances of the CCM. Unlike current approaches for the CCM in the literature;  the proposed scheme considers the position transmission of the CCM as an approximation of backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearities without requiring the exact values of model parameters and their bounds. Online approximation-based robust control laws;  which have the capabilities of estimating unknown system parameters;  are also established. In addition;  the deigned controller can adapt to any changes of the cable-conduit configuration and it is stable. The results of the proposed control techniques have been experimentally validated on a flexible robotic system using a flexible endoscope. Experimental validations show substantial improvements on the performances of position tracking for the use of CCM regardless of the arbitrary changes of the cable-conduit configurations.
