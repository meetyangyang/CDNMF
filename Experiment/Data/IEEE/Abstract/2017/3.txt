We present algorithms for environment exploration in the context of a habitat monitoring task;  where the goal is to track radio-tagged invasive fish with autonomous surface or ground robots. The first task is navigation around an unknown obstacle using an input from a front-facing sonar. This capability is important for navigation on inland lakes;  because plants and shallow shorelines are hard to map in advance. The second task involves energy harvesting for long-term operation. We address the problem of exploring the solar map of the environment which is used for energy-efficient navigation. For both problems;  we present online algorithms and examine their performance using competitive analysis. In competitive analysis;  the performance of an online algorithm is compared against the optimal offline algorithm. For obstacle avoidance;  the offline algorithm knows the shape of the obstacle. For solar exploration;  the offline algorithm knows the geometry of the shadow-casting objects. We obtain an $O(1)$ competitive ratio for obstacle avoidance and an $O(\\log n)$ competitive ratio for solar exploration;  where $n$ is the number of critical points to observe. The strategies for obstacle avoidance are validated through extensive field experiments;  and the strategies for exploration are validated with simulations.
