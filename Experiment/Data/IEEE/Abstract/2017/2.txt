Algorithms for fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) must integrate on-board sensor capabilities and vehicle maneuver constraints to reliably satisfy the objectives of persistent surveillance;  path planning;  and trajectory management. In many cases;  the characteristic dimensions of sensor fields of view are comparable with the turning radius of the UAS platform. Consequently;  when persistent;  full area;  time-critical coverage is required and the number of assets is limited;  the complexity of path planning is increased;  as the turn radius becomes comparable with or exceeds the sensor footprint. A technique is developed to integrate persistent surveillance mission requirements with sensor resolution and field-of-view to facilitate efficient path planning. Graph search techniques and spline-based methods are combined to develop computationally simple algorithms that converge to feasible paths with G\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n continuity. (G\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n continuity in this context means the path;  which is constructed from a concatenated series of C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\ xmlns:xlink=\http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\>2</sup>\n curve segments;  and its derivatives are continuous through two derivatives;  but the magnitudes of second derivatives may differ at the boundaries;  where these curve segments are joined to form the entire path. Curvature is continuous throughout). Two example cases are provided. In the first;  the turning radius is small in comparison with the sensor footprint;  while in the second;  the minimum turn radius is a critical parameter in the determination of a feasible path.
