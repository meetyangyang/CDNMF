This paper is concerned with a reinforcement learning-based adaptive tracking control technique to tolerate faults for a class of unknown multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear discrete-time systems with less learning parameters. Not only abrupt faults are considered;  but also incipient faults are taken into account. Based on the approximation ability of neural networks;  action network and critic network are proposed to approximate the optimal signal and to generate the novel cost function;  respectively. The remarkable feature of the proposed method is that it can reduce the cost in the procedure of tolerating fault and can decrease the number of learning parameters and thus reduce the computational burden. Stability analysis is given to ensure the uniform boundedness of adaptive control signals and tracking errors. Finally;  three simulations are used to show the effectiveness of the present strategy.
