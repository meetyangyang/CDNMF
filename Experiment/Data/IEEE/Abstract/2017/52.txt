Primary care;  the backbone of the nation's healthcare system;  is at the risk of collapse. Patients are dissatisfied due to poor access to care;  and physicians are unhappy and burning out with an enormous amount of tasks. To improve the primary care access;  many healthcare organizations have introduced electronic visits (or e-visits) to provide patient-physician communications through securing messages. In this paper;  we introduce an analytical model to study e-visits in primary care clinics. Analytical formulas to evaluate the mean and variance of the patient length of visit in primary care clinics with e-visits are derived. System properties are investigated. In addition;  comparisons of different scheduling policies between the office and the e-visits are carried out. The first come first serve;  preemptive-resume;  and non-preemptive policies are studied and the results show that the first come first serve policy typically leads to the best performance.
