We analyze the completion time of wafer lots in single-armed cluster tools with parallel processing modules (PMs) by considering the lot switching operation. To effectively assign wafer lots and dispatch overhead hoist transports (OHTs) to manufacturing tools;  it is crucial to obtain the completion time of wafer lots. However;  estimating the completion time is not straightforward;  due to the concurrent processing of two consecutive wafer lots during lot switching operation;  which often increases wafer sojourn times in PMs. In this paper;  we derive closed-form expressions of the completion time of wafer lots in single-armed cluster tools with parallel PMs. We assume that the robot unloads wafers in the order of their loading sequence. We then experimentally show that the formulas derived can be used even when processing time variation exists or another robot task sequence;  which is of first-in first-out (FIFO);  is assumed.
