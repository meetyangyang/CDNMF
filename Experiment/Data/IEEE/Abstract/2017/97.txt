In a heating;  ventilation;  and air conditioning system;  an air-handling system is a key module. Its components (e.g.;  air handling unit;  air-mixing box;  and fans);  linked through airflows;  condition air to a desired temperature and/or humidity based on comfort or controlled environment requirements. Identifying failure modes and estimating their severities allow maintenance crews to know which faults have occurred;  how critical they are;  and be guided in the repair process to improve the system availability. The problem of fault detection and diagnosis in air-handling systems is complex because of fault propagation across components;  and high false alarm rates caused by uncertainties in system and measurement dynamics. In this paper;  to capture fault propagation impacts in an efficient manner;  dynamic hidden Markov models are developed to identify failure modes;  since they contain state transition matrices depending on other components and do not generate joint states. To filter out false alarms;  “coupled statistical process control” techniques are developed by using state transitions matrices representing coupling among components. Experimental results show that the method can effectively diagnose faults with high-diagnosis accuracy.
