This paper presents the precision motion control of a piezoelectric nanopositioning stage using a new scheme of adaptive sliding mode control with uncertainty and disturbance estimation (ASMC-UDE). One uniqueness of the reported ASMC-UDE scheme is that an inherent chattering-free control action is guaranteed by eliminating the use of discontinuous control term. The reported ASMC-UDE strategy is easy to realize because the hysteresis effect is not needed to be modeled. Instead;  the hysteresis is estimated and compensated by the robust control scheme. The control scheme is applicable to a system plant with either matched or unmatched disturbances. Unlike the existing UDE-based SMC control schemes;  a reference model is not required by the proposed ASMC-UDE scheme. The stability of the chattering-free SMC strategy is proved in theory under the Lyapunov framework. The superiority of the presented control scheme over conventional approaches has been confirmed through comparative experimental studies. Moreover;  the robustness of the controller in the presence of model disturbance and external disturbance has been verified.
