Timed event graphs (TEGs) are suitable to model manufacturing systems in which synchronization and delay phenomena appear. Since 1980s;  TEGs are studied as a class of linear discrete event systems in idempotent semirings such as the (min; +) algebra. In this paper;  we consider the class of weighted TEGs (WTEGs) that corresponds to TEGs where the edges have integer weights. By introducing nonunitary weights;  WTEGs widen the class of manufacturing systems that can be modeled;  especially systems with batches and duplications. Moreover;  a subclass of WTEGs called weight-balanced TEGs (WB-TEGs) can be studied with the algebraic tools that stem from the theory of (min; +) linear systems. In this paper;  the focus lies on some modeling issues for manufacturing systems. Besides cutting and palletization operations;  it is shown that WB-TEGs are also well adapted to describe periodic routing policies and;  in a symmetrical way;  how to merge flows similar to a multiplexer. In order to simplify the modeling step;  a class of cycloweighted TEGs (CW-TEGs) is introduced. It is an extension of WTEGs where the weights of the edges can change according to a periodic sequence. Finally;  we propose some elements of modeling that can be described by CW-TEGs or equivalently with an input-output transfer relation in an appropriate idempotent semiring of operators.
