Digital networked control systems are of growing importance in safety-critical systems and perform indispensable function in most complex systems today. Networked degradations such as transmission delay and packet dropout cause such systems to fail to satisfy performance requirements;  and eventually affect the overall reliability. It is necessary to get a model to verify and evaluate the system reliability in early design phase;  prior to its implementation. However;  existing probabilistic models only provide partial descriptions of such coupled networks and control system. In this paper;  a new stochastic model represented by linear discrete-time approach is proposed;  considering data packet transmissions in both channels: controller-to-actuator and sensor-to-controller. Different from pervious works;  the historical behaviors of networked degradations are modeled by multistate Markov chains with uncertainties;  releasing the assumption that faults of all periods are independent of each other. The concept of domain requirements for such systems is considered here;  contributing to the integration of control and reliability engineering. Methodologies for quantitatively assessing the reliability of the single- and sequential-control goal are derived from the Monte Carlo method. An example of an industrial heat exchanger digital networked control system is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and method.
