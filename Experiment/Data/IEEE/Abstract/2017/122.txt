An improved solution for drug distribution is presented in this paper. It is divided into two parts: i) a multi-operator evolutionary algorithm in charge of calculating the initial delivery routes and ii) an ambient intelligence-based support system able to tracing the merchandise along the distribution route. The first one establishes the routes to be followed by the vehicles;  based on a proposal of estimation of the travel times. The second one is formed by a system able to recognize and trace the drugs inside each vehicle. A laboratory experimentation has been conducted in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the route calculator. In addition;  a field experimentation has been carried out by implementing the traceability system in a delivery van which of the drug distributor in the city of Bilbao.
