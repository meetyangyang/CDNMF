High penetration of renewable generation will increase the requirement for both operating reserve (OR) and frequency response (FR);  due to its variability;  uncertainty;  and limited inertia capability. Although the importance of optimal scheduling of OR has been widely studied;  the scheduling of FR has not yet been fully investigated. In this context;  this paper proposes a computationally efficient mixed integer linear programming formulation for a full stochastic scheduling model that simultaneously optimizes energy production;  OR;  FR;  and underfrequency load shedding. By using value of lost load (VOLL) as the single security measure;  the model optimally balances the cost associated with the provision of various ancillary services against the benefit of reduced cost of load curtailment. The proposed model is applied in a 2030-GB system to demonstrate its effectiveness. The impact of installed capacity of wind generation and setting of VOLL is also analyzed.
