Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3-D printing refers to a new class of technologies that actively construct products directly from any 3-D digital model. In the future;  the broader applications of AM will require a cost reduction of AM machines. Currently;  the products fabricated by low-end machines;  such as those fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) processes;  suffer from the issue of low dimensional accuracy due to multiple error sources. To properly manage error sources for improved prevision;  this paper proposes a novel strategy for error compensation in the FDM processes. First;  we consecutively attribute the dimensional inaccuracy to two major error sources that affect the geometric shape of the product: 1) positioning error of the extruder and 2) shape deformation induced by processing error;  including material phase change and other variations that occur. The extruder positioning error is characterized by a Kriging model;  while the modeling of shape deformation due to processing error follows the method developed by Huang et al. Second;  using error equivalence concept;  we transform the positioning error into the equivalent amount of design input error. Finally;  we adjust the design to compensate for the overall shape deviation. To validate this strategy;  we conduct a designed experiment for the shape deviation prediction and the compensation. The experimental results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three-step strategy to manage multiple error sources in the FDM processes.
