In light of significant complexity of the byproduct gas system in steel industry (which limits an ability to establish its physics-based model);  this paper proposes a data-based predictive optimization (DPO) method to carry out real-time adjusting for the gas system. Two stages of the method;  namely;  the prediction modeling and real-time optimization;  are involved. At the prediction stage;  the states of the optimized objectives;  the consumption of the outsourcing natural gas and oil;  the power generation;  and the tank levels;  are forecasted based on a proposed mixed Gaussian kernel-based prediction intervals (PIs) construction model. The Jacobian matrix of this model is represented by a kernel matrix through derivation;  which greatly facilitates the subsequent calculation. At the second stage;  a rolling optimization based on a mathematical programming technique involving continuous and integer decision-making variables is developed via the PIs. To demonstrate the performance of the DPO method;  the practical data coming from the energy center of a steel plant are employed. The results show that the proposed DPO method can supply the human operators with effective solution for secure and economically justified optimization of the gas system.
