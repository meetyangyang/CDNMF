This paper presents a fine-grained positioning method for radio frequency identification (RFID). The proposed method applies hyperbolic positioning to locate ultrahigh frequency passive RFID tags. In our design;  finding the tagged object's location is formulated as an optimization problem. Phase values;  collected by the moving antenna;  are exploited to achieve the optimal solution. The intuition of hyperbolic positioning lies in that the difference of distances from a target tag to two antennas can be inferred from phases. When integrating hyperbola curves together;  optimization method can be performed to achieve the object's location. Particle swarm optimization is then applied to enhance computational ability. For random phases;  polynomial regression is employed to model the relationship between phase values and distances. We implement a prototype of hyperbolic positioning optimization to pinpoint the RFID tag's location and evaluate its performance in our laboratory environment. Compared with other RFID localization methods;  i.e.;  received signal strength indicator based and phase-based approaches;  our design shows greater tolerance to tag diversity and tag orientation.
