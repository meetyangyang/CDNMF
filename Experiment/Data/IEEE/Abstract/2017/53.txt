In this paper;  a modified repetitive control (MRC) based approach is developed for high-speed tracking of nanopositioning stages. First;  the hysteresis nonlinearity is decomposed as a periodic disturbance over a linear system. Then;  the MRC technique is utilized to account for the periodic disturbances/errors caused by the hysteresis and dynamics behaviors. The developed approach provides a simple and effective hysteresis compensation strategy;  avoiding the constructions of hysteresis model and its inversion. Besides;  with improved loop-shaping properties;  the MRC can alleviate the nonperiodic disturbance amplification problem of the conventional repetitive control. Finally;  the effectiveness and performance of the developed MRC-based approach are verified by the experimental results on a custom-built piezo-actuated stage in terms of hysteresis compensation;  disturbance rejection and tracking accuracy.
