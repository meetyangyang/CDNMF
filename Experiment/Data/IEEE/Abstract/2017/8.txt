Continuous five-axis sweep scanning is an emerging technology for free-form surface inspection;  which;  unlike the traditional three-axis inspection that works in a point-by-point manner;  keeps the stylus tip in constant contact with the surface during the scanning;  and thus could tremendously improve the inspection efficiency. However;  at present;  it mostly depends on humans to plan a five-axis inspection path;  which severely affects the potential use of this new technology. In this paper;  we report a practical algorithm;  which is able to automatically generate a five-axis inspection path for an arbitrary free-form surface. The crux of this algorithm is that the unique kinematic characteristics of the five-axis inspection machine are fully considered and utilized when a path is planned. As a direct result of this consideration and utilization;  the inspection efficiency is tremendously increased;  often 20-30 times better than an inspection path obtained by any traditional path planning algorithm that disregards the inspection machine itself. The experiments performed by us have fully validated this point.
