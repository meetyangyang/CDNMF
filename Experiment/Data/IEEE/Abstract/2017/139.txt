Many workflow applications are moved to clouds for elastic capacities. Elastic resource provisioning is one of the most important problems. Realistic factors are involved;  including an interval-based charging model;  data transfer time;  VM loading time;  software setup time;  resource utilization;  and the workflow deadline. A multirule-based heuristic is proposed for the problem under study which contains two components: a deadline division and task scheduling. Taking into account the gaps between tasks;  the impact of different critical paths and the precedence constraints;  the workflow deadline is properly divided into task deadlines based on the solution of a relaxed problem. The relaxed problem is modeled by integer programming and solved by CPLEX. All tasks are sorted in terms of the developed depth-based rule. For different realistic factors;  three priority rules are developed to allocate tasks to appropriate available time slots;  from which a weighted rule is constructed for task scheduling. The weights are calibrated by random instances. Experiments are conducted using a benchmark realistic workflow. Experimental results show that the proposal is effective and efficient for realistic workflows.
