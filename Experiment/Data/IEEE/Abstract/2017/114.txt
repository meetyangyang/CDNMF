In this paper;  a novel bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA)-Gaussian support vector classifier machine (GSVCM) model was proposed to improve the fatigue classification accuracy of electromyography (EMG) signals. This optimization mechanism involves the kernel parameter setting in the GSVCM training procedure;  which significantly influences the classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted based on the EMG signal to differentiate the normal and fatigue status. In the proposed method;  the EMG signals were decomposed into intrinsic mode functions by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) before the mean instantaneous frequency could be obtained by Hilbert transform (HT). Finally;  the fatigue statistical features can be extracted from fast Fourier transform and EEMD-HT. The application of this model to the fatigue status recognition of EMG signal indicated that further significant enhancement of the classification accuracy can be achieved by the proposed BFA-GSVCM classification system. The diagnostic method is effective and feasible.
