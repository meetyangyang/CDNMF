This paper presents new challenges for the development of reconfigurable wireless sensor networks (RWSNs) that adapt dynamically their behaviors to their environment under different properties. An RWSN is a set of networked nodes that execute reconfigurable software tasks for the control of local sensors. We propose a new design methodology named RWiN of an RWSN using unified modeling language (UML) to analyze;  construct;  develop;  and verify easily RWSN architectures. For that;  we formulate a metamodel of RWSN based on UML to describe a zone-based architecture that uses a communication protocol for the optimization of distributed reconfigurations. To control the design complexity;  we model each agent of this architecture by nested state machines. To verify the temporal constraints by communicating agents;  each one is modeled by a timed automaton. The paper's contribution is applied to a case study;  which is simulated with TRMSim-WSN and UPPAAL environment to expose the originality of this new architecture.
