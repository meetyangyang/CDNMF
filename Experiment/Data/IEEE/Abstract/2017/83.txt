Transient fault (TF) and intermittent fault (IF) of complex electronic systems are difficult to diagnose. As the performance of electronic products degrades over time;  the results of fault diagnosis could be different at different times for the given identical fault symptoms. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based fault diagnosis methodology in the presence of TF and IF for electronic systems is proposed. DBNs are used to model the dynamic degradation process of electronic products;  and Markov chains are used to model the transition relationships of four states;  i.e.;  no fault;  TF;  IF;  and permanent fault. Our fault diagnosis methodology can identify the faulty components and distinguish the fault types. Four fault diagnosis cases of the Genius modular redundancy control system are investigated to demonstrate the application of this methodology.
