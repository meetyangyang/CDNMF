This paper considers multi-degree cyclic scheduling in automated electroplating lines with multiple hoists. In a line;  hoists share the same overhead track and cannot cross over each other while transporting parts. To avoid conflicts among hoists;  the hoist assignment principle without overlapping is applied. Identical parts with processing time windows are produced. The objective is to maximize the throughput of the line;  equivalently to minimize the cycle time in given degree cycles. Previous work mainly focuses on simple cycles;  i.e.;  1-degree cycles. This paper considers multi-degree cycles to improve the throughput;  which is the main contribution of this research. Operations of multi-degree cycles are analyzed in details. Then;  a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to obtain the optimal schedules. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the schedules obtained in multi-degree cycles based on the model proposed. A number of randomly generated instances simulating practical data are tested. Computational results show the benefits of multi-degree cycles and the efficiency of the approach proposed in practice.
