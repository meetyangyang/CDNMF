Printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) is a process of connecting various electronic components through printed circuit boards (PCBs). Due to the need to assemble a lot of components and PCBs at the same time;  the PCBA process tends to become the bottleneck in an assembly line. Many assembly firms have thus introduced automated PCBA machines to expedite this process. However;  to best operate these machines;  effective PCBA planning is still required. Some nature-inspired metaheuristics such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithm (GA) have been increasingly used for the PCBA planning. Also;  we find that particle swarm optimization (PSO) has never been employed to deal with the feeder assignment problem (FAP) and component sequencing problem (CSP) at the same time;  though it has been regarded as a good competitor to GAs. In this paper;  we developed two PSO-based approaches to deal with the two problems simultaneously for a chip shooter machine. In addition;  we have conducted experiments to compare the two PSO-based approaches with two GA-based approaches. The experimental results showed that PSO2;  the PSO-based approach with sigmoid functions;  outperformed others in terms of assembly cycle time. The comparison with an exact approach further shows that PSO2 has a high rate to find the optimal/near-optimal solution.
