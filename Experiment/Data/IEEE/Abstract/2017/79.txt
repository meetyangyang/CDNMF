Automatic wafer prealignment is an important process in wafer manufacturing;  whereby its flat edge is set at a predefined angle and its center is set in a predefined position; translational and rotational movement compensate for deviation of the wafer. However;  as the traditional wafer prealignment algorithm depends on marked templates at the training stage when the type of wafer is changed;  the templates need to be retrained. This paper proposes a new wafer prealignment algorithm;  based on Fourier transform for orientation prealignment and least square regression for position prealignment;  which will automatically adapt to different types of wafers in 2-D space. Results from experiments with the proposed algorithm on a laser-scribing machine using two types of wafer show that the orientation prealignment achieved an accuracy of 0.05Â°;  the position prealignment achieved an accuracy of 5 pixels;  and the average operation time was approximately 1.5 s. As prealignment algorithm therefore meets real-time efficiency and precision requirements;  it is suitable for use with semiconductor devices.
