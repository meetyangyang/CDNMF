In this paper;  an approximation-free funnel feedback controller is proposed for a class of nonlinear servomechanisms to achieve prescribed tracking error performance. An improved funnel function is proposed to guarantee the transient and asymptotic behavior of the tracking error within a given funnel boundary. The proposed funnel function removes the imposed assumption used in conventional funnel controls (e.g.;  systems with relative degree one or two) and avoids the potential singularity problem in prescribed performance controls. Moreover;  an extended state observer (ESO) is used to address the effect of unknown dynamics in the control system (e.g.;  friction and disturbances);  where the ESO parameters can be easily designed based on the control system bandwidth. The stability of the proposed control system with ESO and funnel function is analyzed via the Lyapunov theory. Comparative simulations and experimental results are conducted based on a practical turntable servomechanisms to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.
