This paper deals with the identification of discrete-event manufacturing systems that are automated using a programmable logic controller (PLC). The behavior of the closed-loop system (PLC and Plant) is observed during its operation and is represented by a single long sequence of observed input/output (I/O) signals vectors. The proposed method follows a black-box and passive identification approach that allows addressing large and complex industrial DES and yields compact and expressive interpreted Petri net (IPN) models. It consists of two complementary stages; the first one obtains;  from the I/O sequence;  the reactive part of the model composed by observable places and transitions. The I/O sequence is also mapped into a sequence of the created transitions;  from which the second stage builds the non observable part of the model including places that ensure the reproduction of the observed input output sequence. This method;  based on polynomial-time algorithms on the size of the input data;  has been implemented as a software tool that generates and draws the IPN model; it has been tested with input/output sequences obtained from real systems in operation. The tool is described and its application is illustrated through a case study.
